#  **01.22.19**

**General Notes - Pastor Joshua**

  * WINS

    * Joshua - finishing all the setup for the budget || at least a legitimate prospect guest in each service

    * David - really great seeing the Revere ppl who came out during the snow storm

    * Tanisha - PK outing was necessary for them + really good || not one ACK volunteer didn’t come up

    * Hoana - Chris Abbott has continued to come to ACY - meeting w/ him today

    * Danielle - budget completely set with Tom

    * 3/16 Street team party: everyone is welcome (both promote Lynn + Revere)

    * 3/31 - will need to find someone to be PD on Sunday AM (PR used to be the primary person) **CTH to talk about with PK**

  

  * Expensify - new sign on information

    * UN: pj@ecic.tv

    * PW: !158Oo97 (the letter Oo - not zero)

  

  * Accounts list review

    * equity acct - functions like an income + expense account

      * money offering + square coming goes into 93110

      * when money is spent, it comes out of this same number

    * use income form

      * camp payment over generush, no form is needed (if there is a button on website)

    * if using generush, make sure there is a button on website

      * if needed: two sentence description, picture + dates needed PJ

      * will need to add in a 5% increase on total cost of event to cover the generush costs

      * originally setup as a giving option

    * income is either an equity or income number

    *  expense accounts in CAPS = categories

      * if there is ever a sub-account, never use a general category

      * only use 5-digit account numbers

    * at the end of every month, we will be given reports of our budgeted + actual spending during out 1:1s

    * all requests for central categories need to be cleared through PK

      * you still have to clear your budget w/ PJ through the year

      * operations: central: vehicle fuel does not need PK’s approval

      * KidsRock - would be Lynn kids category

      * metrokids needs to come out of teams

        * if there are no teams, PK would most likely say let’s bring that out of central outreach (it will not come out of this years personal ministry budget)

  

  

**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * continued discussion on account list + what accounts staff is in charge of

  * if our actual number are above budget, we’l put everyone else on question + ask what else do you need?

  * retirement discussion

    * you need to get your credentials bc it will financial benefit 

    * MBA accounts will be setup for pastoral staff

      * could functionally add up to $1800 

      * grant from Lilly foundation in 

  * last week we talked about posture for very outward focus

    * discipleship is significant - focus on those who previously who did not know Jesus

    * we’re going to setup a 3month 4DX goal that is outward focus in nature

    * as an organization, begin to think about what is our wildly important goal that we could accomplish in 3months that is outwardly focused (to be accomplished by a team)

      * 2017 goal - attendance of 500x3 Sundays in a row

      * lead measures were focused on follow-up

    * PK Q: what kind of goals could that be? who do we currently see the least amount of outward focus?

      * PJ - 1st services in Lynn + Revere (certain types of guests that are less likely to show up)

      * PT - her YMCA ppl don’t know Jesus: we should 

        * PK - this is a lead measure

      * PJ - how many invitations are made each week?

      * PK - lag measures: class, baptism, small groups, start dinner

      * if we do an effective evangelism in the community, if we are being outwardly focused, how would we know? what would happen as the result?

        * have more first time guests + returning guests, returning guest option on connection card, how many VIP bags passed out, increase in start dinner, number of bulletins we need to print (this would assume retention rates would be the same), registered guests

      * is it possible for us to be better by tripling down on registered guests? these have historically been non-believers

        * PJ - are we making sure VIP is thinking about non-believers?

          * PK - its not their job to differentiate  

        * PK - START skews us with previously churched ppl most of the time
