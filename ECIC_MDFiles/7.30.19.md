      * metrokids in revere that week 

      * Sodas street team 930 - potential for van use?

    * Baptism service

      * staff to check ppl who are serving if they’ve been baptised

      * PH Q: are we doing baptism t-shirt?

      * PK doesn’t want to make it more programmed

      * PDS: make sure the sound system + tent make it to baptism and are being setup at 5pm

    * ACY end of summer party - probably not at Lynn location

    * LEAD Retreat

      * PDS - reach out to Roy Lucier re last years menu: how much he spent, what meals were, etc

      * PD Q: what sound equipment 

      * PJ Q: from your experience, what is the primary goal of LEAD retreat? 

        * PDS A: fellowship; leadership development

        * PT A: budding relationships; 

        * PD A: give our leaders some fellowship time with each other for unity; providing them with quality time with each of the staff; men + women get to spend time together separately; 

        * PH A: encouraging our leaders; challenging ppl to apply what is learned; 

      * PJ Q: content-wise, if you were trying to do the above, what do your ppl need told to them in order to become closer to Jesus, better leaders, etc || how does your team 

        * PT A: lead yourself; get better at formatting/aligning our lives to our call than our call to our lives; freq its a damn w/ life on the otherside + not releasing (unwilling to give up or push past or work thru); holiness; our ppl don’t know how to make disciples even though they can serve all day; 

        * PD A: renting vs ownership; 

        * PDS A: helping ppl understand that there is something that needs to be given up - something better on the side; 

        * PH A: some need to apply that we are growing + to be teachable and letting going of things the way things are

        * PJ A: ppl who have been t this for awhile + there is a plateuing that has happened - encourage to find a new summit

      * craft an encounter moment that concretes a profound change - a debrief session where you ask who are you going to talk to about it what; something that creates a lot of movement; actual physical movement from table/group to table/group — good for the last session

        * Fri PM: sermony sermon (inspire)

        * Saturday AM: skill set (inform)

        * Saturday afternoon: debrief (initiate)

      * PT rec: create planned recreation opportunities (( PJ agrees - will talk about next week ))
