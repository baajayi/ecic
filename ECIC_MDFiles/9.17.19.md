    * PJ Q: from scratch, nothing matters, if you were going to lead a prayer meeting that was meaningful to you, describe that meeting

      * PH: hike + pray together at the top - have something tangible (rock), write on it, do something with it

      * PT: centralized, piano worship, bibles + paper available(writing while praying), have someone lead specifically in the direction we are praying (lightly lead) — at the gym
