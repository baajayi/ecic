        * they need to tell you in advance what they are doing

      * PT- wants learning activity - will take 

    * 315 - 345 goal= breakup into groups of 10-15ppl (maybe larger) w/ a breakout session in the general area of witness

      * PJ would like several of them to be street team + try these breakout sessions(activity) AND breakup into 2 different sessions to talk through something(learning/workshop moments)
