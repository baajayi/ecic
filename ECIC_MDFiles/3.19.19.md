**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * 3rd service trend - downward (beginning of the new year with kids and now that 

    * we need to identify who is no longer in 3rd service

      * they are just not there

    * PJ has already followed up on (Cristal, Taina, Courtney)

    * sometimes it’s them making a decision or sometimes it’s us being sloppy (usually the 2nd of the two)

    * Q: are we giving our best to the smaller services?

  * Continuing Roofing Concerns

    * roofers took our threat of a lawsuit + sent it to their insurance company + we were already in process of filing

    * they are going to bring out their adjusters + maybe engineers

    * our insurance company says their insurance co is a real deal w/ big pockets

    * Trahant will not be touching our roof again - hopefully we’ll get a lump sum + get it fixed

    * problems: didn’t bring up to code - no permit obtained - new drain not put in - reused all the old flashing - no properly installed (glue should have held water back)

  * Project Management (will continue next time - left for roofing adjuster)

    * Q: what comes to your mind?

      * overseeing someone else who does it

      * entire process until complete

      * gathering/leading a team

    * everybody has tasks and also has projects
