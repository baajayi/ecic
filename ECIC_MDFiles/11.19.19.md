  * Internal Tent Making

    * as staff get older is that our pay scale goes up significantly and how do we do that

    * what do we think the pay rate what it should be + what it is + how do we get it to there

      * with our existing staff, this is almost impossible with our current church income

      * pushed it back to PK to look at other options

    * an example we currently do: own property + rent it, visiting teams, 

    * somebody could shift a portfolio + somebody could do partly missional but significantly cash flow (ie be in charge of teams + _______)

    * Tom Clegg: if running teams, could they take 8-10 weeks off of their other responsibilities

    * PK Q: are there other things that could use the church umbrella to create something else || what other missions/churches that have done that are positive cash flow?

      * PJ A: Nelson Scery’s - take expertise + consultings/trainings, independent tech contractors, photography studio/business, 

      * PH A: PK could write his emotional bank book, event coordinating/wedding, talento(food), 

      * (( Britney Moses ))

      * PDS A:  

      * PD A: music lessons, bookstore, merchandise, 

      * Jesse: cafe 

      * PK A: office rentals, city wear

    * PK wouldn’t want someone to have to do something they hated - focus on something that they are more passionate about

    * PK’s core desire to make sure the staff gets paid correctly
