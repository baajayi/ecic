**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * start dinner - price out round tables (CTH)

    * if to use the cafe, would need to change the time to 6pm

    * in Revere, PD had table leaders to help fill out questions + sheets

    * PK wasn’t able to meet everyone at the last Revere start + felt they were please PK was there to make it full circle

    * if PK cannot be at Revere, PJ will need to be there (+ will need to cover Wed PM setup)

  * Restore Conference

    * promote leadership conference - we are not overing cost

    * signup table for a couple of weeks (Lynn + Revere)

    * current + future leaders

    * someone who is serving

    * Chris Hodges - Church of the Highlands (in the south)

    * ARC = assembly of related churches (modern)

    * not necessarily AG but some can be

    * similar setup to last conference

    * several ppl implemented ideas from Ketterling

  * Easter is coming

    * this is our opportunity to increase our attendnce

    * we grew in the month of easter + then sept/oct

    * be super attentive - this is the time to harvest, not rest

    * there is cultural pressure that help ppl push in the right direction

    * we can break 100 in Revere - use the Italian holy days

    * ALWAYS be prepared well in advance 

      * talk to workers - this is not the day to take off - everybody show off

      * increase your staff load

      * make sure you are really prepared to handle what we want to see happen

      * get workers on board now + help troubleshoot their life now (push back lunch by an hour)

  * make sure we have proper communication between Lynn + Revere

    * critical element = video

      * PD needs to communicate to PH each week

      * PJ to help facilitate communication

    * PD - it would be great to create a logistic plan 

    * PK - PD has no control on what’s handed to him but he does have control once 

    * PK - there needs to be a dress rehearsal EVERY WEEK just like you would do it on a Sunday at both locations

    * Camera recording sound issue - record from two channels on camera - record in mono

  * John Thurell will be starting next Wednesday

    * coming on staff as facilities person - not cleaning but projects

    * stopped looking for receptionist at this point unless CTH finds someone

    * we do not give assignments to him

    * with PR being gone, this is a good time to have a creative idea + now you are required to get them done

      * take responsibility + get it executed

      * pull the volunteers + get it done (ie painting, building)

    * there will be a maintenance project in ToDoIst where staff can request items to be done

    * the board (includes PK) did a blue-sky session on feedback that would be helpful for our church

      * all agreed that the Main Aud needs to be flipped before the mom’s room

      * lobby will need to be 

      * someone will need to clean the floors after services

  * Stairwell doors should be open in the winter during the week

  * Storage

    * in Lynn most of the stuff creating chaos

    * behind the wall - this is not storage for ministry stuff only chairs (we still need to staging at the moment)

    * in Revere - 

    * review spring cleaning week - staff will wipe calendar clean (limited number of meetings) and recruit ppl to assist you to clean the assigned places

    * should be scheduled before Easter

  * questions asked to PK

    * he’s been tracking them

    * how to manage calendar is one item

  * Managing Your Calendar

    * today will not be the same way you manage it a year or 5 yrs from now

    * it’s a bit of a living breathing life of it’s own

    * there is a point in early ministry where you don’t have control over - you are told where to be/do/etc

    * as time goes on, your have control over certain elements of it

    * common thing PK is asked: what is taking so long?

      * PK thinks its comes down to how you mange your calendar

    * traveling between locations, traveling should be calendared 

      * if done multiple times a week, there is lost time

    * another way to lose time is going between all of our buildings

    * try to get the meeting done in the most efficient way possible

      * ie I need meet with 10ppl within 20hrs

      * if I waste 13 hours traveling I cannot get it done

      * have ppl come to me/where I am

    * work harder at getting your meetings into places that doesn’t cost as much time (time gets lost in transition)

      * sometimes it’s 100% worth it BUT only if it’s the most important meeting in this month

    * with hospital visits, always have another thing to do

      * ie always have a book with you 

    * find ways to redeem your wasted time - have a book, computer, phone

    * be prepared for things you value and those things will get done

      * example given of Pastor Tim carrying postcards that he could sign when he had a down moments

    * you don’t have time to let 30minutes disappear

      * you don’t need to work harder, it’s working in a manner that is smarter for you

      * create in your calendar to  allows you to capture some of your deadtime

    * ways time can be stolen: silly text messages, 

    * make sure you are having the right meetings with the right people

      * if the person you are meeting with hits your staff report and if they would be mortified to find out that it was part of your job instead of as a friend, this might not be the right person 

      * they will also need to know this

      * some of this is what your posture is like towards them

    * have I been meeting with the right ppl? in the right places? taking advantage of my downtimes? capturing moments to benefit task list? 

    * margin needs to be included

      * the Bible says one day, needs to be for rest 

        * 6days for the everyday things

      * its’ really important in your day off, that this is a margin day for you - to rest and doesn’t necessarily mean sleep - get things peaceful - 

      * but there are other days during week

        * create margin in your life by putting it in your calendar

        * if you are out doing ministry 5nights a week that too much - if only Wednesday, that’s too little

      * you’re facing a technological time suck that PK only understands a portion of

        * be very careful how much social media time in your places for margin

      * sometimes meetings should really be 5minute phone calls/text message/email which can free up a ton of time

    * PK Q: how is email used

      * PDS: used only for business stuff - wouldn’t email leaders - would use it for Revere Parks + Rec

      * PH: with some ministries is through email only (Erin + Adam) otherwise it’s email

      * PD: only a couple of ppl he would use email for + business reasons

      * PT: has a select group of ppl uses email (uses on a daily basis to share ministry resource etc) or when needs to keep track of or help in searching for items

      * PK: there seems to be an age component - it used to be personal not business for a long time

    * PK Q: how does this impact our calendar?

      * no one has ever emailed on [metrokids@ecic.tv](mailto:metrokids@ecic.tv) \+ only 1 email from a new family 

    * PK Q: how is it that you setup a meeting when not face to face?

      * PT: done via text - 

      * PD: has to text most of the time - when initiating, calendar open + then text

      * PH: likes to start in person + then finish in text (PD does this as well)

    * PK Q: challenges on setting up meetings?

      * PD: location barrier + ppl not showing up (TIME STEALER)

      * PK: it’s almost necessary to make sure someone is coming to the meeting (day before or morning of) - he see’s this with meeting other pastors at other churches

        * can be a reminder OR you know they aren’t coming it allows them to formally let you know they aren’t coming OR google calendar invite

  * Accountable to You?

    * PT Q: can we have ppl sign up if they are interested?

  * Israel Trip - might be better for pastoral staff to hook up with a familiarization tour ($1600 instead of $4000)
