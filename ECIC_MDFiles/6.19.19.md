**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * reminder from CTH: Beyond Walls on Monday 7/22 + media needs **CTH to get more info - skip Jen to get more info - PT is concerned about being at camp the week before - could she get a volunteer? PK says yes**

    * **per PK, there will have to be a staff person on point for the Beyond Walls VIP lounge - could be CTH but not Saturdays  **

  * reminder from CTH: only admin should be saying anything to anyone about calendar availability **take a message and ask CTH especially in Lynn**

  * reminder from CTH: ToDo List on google drive for John Thurell **tasks staff to add in anything they see on any building and PK then approve things to do - needs to be in the maintenance realm that staff cannot do (not cleaning anything)**

    * CTH to add all staff

  * PK Q: 1st floor mansion kitchen

    * John thinks it’s the 2nd floor shower

  * coaching 

    * coaching is not mentoring - it means staff does the work 

    * coaches listen and ask questions

    * it’s not a ’tell me what to do’ session

    * start preparing directly after your coaching session - not 30min before

    * PT: Annie was very clear on the expectations/guidelines

  * Dumpster + roofing at mansion

    * will be put into driveway

    * will start with the rubber roofs first

  * Father’s Day review

    * PK: numbers seem to be a little fake

    * PK’s alteration = ppl who were not listening to the sermon

    * staff take-ways | how did it hit ministries

      * PK: there was a greater buzz around it + a better preparation/participation

      * PK Q: did we have more or less user/greeters?

        * PJ A: the same

        * PK noticed they weren’t at their stations + were doing something else

          * they cannot leave their post no matter what + push in on hard - we need to make sure it’s not a habit

      * PJ: not able to do a lot of the activities 

      * PH: extra noises interrupted 

        * PK: cafe needs to not be an option in the future

        * PJ felt it was better experientially when it was crammed (not after 3rd service)

      * PD:

      * PDS: highest attended in kids min this year

        * event was interesting bc they were crammed under two tents but made it work + ppl seemed to have the right attitude about it

        * PK Q: driver? it was just regular ppl - no guests

      * PT: bus ministry picked up kids from ACK + brought them to the food + lost track of one kid

        * PJ to follow-up with bus ministry + armor bearer

    * PK Q: was there a large influx of street people?

      * PJ: towards the end, it seemed to be more of this

        * there was a group who got pulled in by the pigs AND THEN a large number of our least connected ppl who got pulled in somehow

      * PT: confused as to who was the point person + what was supposed to happen

      * PK: maybe we need a ’table host’ or someone to engage and navigate that

        * PJ: there were a couple ppl who were supposed to engage that way

    * PK: so far the best planned and volunteered

    * items short on: cornbread
