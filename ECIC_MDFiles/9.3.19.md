    * no one can use the van on the days John is working: 

    * if you want to use the green van, bring it to staff meeting as a request - CTH to create a green van calendar

  * Website

    * CTH - see if there are different access levels to website

  

  * Promotions

    * all slides need to include name, date, contact info, location info, + about item promoting

  

  * Process of pastoring - example w/ person 

    * original meetings = PT-1.5hr  PJ-1

    * Kristen-2hr (informally)  Jen-2hr 

    * follow-up meetings - PJ-1+1.5

    * PK Q: why isn’t she meeting w/ ministry leader?

      * PJ has been tracking with her for such a long time

      * when someone goes into a discipline moment, tends to push towards PJ

      * PK Q: do we still think this?

    * PK’s assumption: when meeting with someone once, if you need to meet with them a 2nd time, they need to go to counseling

WE ARE NOT COUNSELORS, WE ARE PASTORS

    * PK wants to help ppl but we need to be consistent

      * talks to ministry leader who is a pastor (then coach PT to deal with it) 

        * Kristen is not a counselor when meeting informally as a pastor’s wife

        * we would need to recommend talking to someone other than KK

      * if opposite sex, pass off to another staff member

    * can stop on own (1x or a couple times) vs can’t stop it (habitual)

    * PK wants to create the system to keep ppl moving along but not to be the ones to do the work

    * our definition of counselor = professional Christian counselors 

      * low level is ok

      * heavy stuff they need to be Christian

    * policy category = pastoral counseling

    * referral = giving a name and a number

      * the pastor has to follow-up

      * when? 1st-3rd meeting

        * if not going to a counseling after 2nd meeting or not on the way to starting, somebody has dropped the ball (pastor or person)

        * can we red-flag when going into a 3rd meeting 

    * is there anything else I can do before I drop this? 

    * we need to make sure that these ppl don’t become a problem 

      * unrepentant,

    * all our leverage comes from the holy spirit working within and them choosing the move forward with us

      * if not, this is when we let them go (the prodigal son)

    *
