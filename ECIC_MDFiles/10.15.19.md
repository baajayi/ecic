      * decentralized with small groups

      * pick a family or two + as a group, go crazy in blessing them

  

  

  

  * Kristin Fallica cannot run anything worship in the future

  * PJ to tell Kristin she’s not supposed to sell candy on Sunday or Wednesday evenings

    * after watching teams this year, PK needs this to be part of their job/portfolio if we are to build it the way

**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * 11/24 - PD to preach in Revere? PK needs to find a Sunday to preach in Revere prior to the end of the year

  * Thanksgiving 500 - will be different this year

  

  * Small Groups Expansion

    * timeline: 10/20 - survey passed out (what + when would you attend - PK-Lynn + PD-Revere will do our 1st public pitch for c

    * lead meeting - will continue conversation there someway

    * 10/26 - small group potential leaders meeting (invite only)

    * 11/20- last small group meeting

    * 11/27 - annual thanksgiving eve service

    * kids church on Wednesday PM?

      * PK + PJ to talk today about answer

    * in December we will start talking/promoting pretty hard on Sunday mornings

    * 1/12 - will begin the Lynn small group sign-ups

    * 1/19 - will begin the Revere small group sign-ups

    * 1/26 - new small groups launch

    * categories: bible, freedom, leadership, recreation 

      * mens, women’s, coed, marrieds (deals with who the report is)

      * we are curating the groups after what we’ve been given - staff may be asked to lead a particular group

        * this allows us to make sure there is something from each category

    * this no longer has to take place in Lynn; it can be in Revere, in the woods, virtually anywhere

    * has to be weekly 

    * there will be three semesters: 13weeks, 6weeks, 13weeks (follows local school calendar)

      * this will allow us to pull ppl back in to explore/re-invent yourself

    * core ideas behind groups is every group leader will:

      * open with prayer, close with prayer, + small group leader contact everybody every week (phone call, text, etc)

      * leader responsible early on in the semester is to figure out what the next step is spiritually the person is taking

        * the rest of the semester the leader will follow-up with that one question

        * when a concern comes up, this can be kicked up to the pastors and this is what is different with our small groups compared to previously

        * hard conversations will be handled by the pastors only 

    * congregational care team + pastoral care teams are created

      * congregational care teams will organize meals, hospital visits, etc (groups will probably need to provide some of this)

      * will need a pastoral care process

    * primary way ppl signup for groups will be the church center app through planning center

      * will help fewer ppl get lost in the cracks

    * there will be a learning curve (we’ll probably lean heavy towards recreational since we haven’t before)

    * PK + PJ will vet the ciruculum

    * leaders do not have to be ignited but in process + willing to be managed 

    * youth + kids will run exactly the same right now 

      * will be revisited after the 1st semester of adults

      * youth + kids should have a different category of leader bc they are more vulnerable 

  

  * Watched cut the slack video by Craig Groschel

    * we have real ineffeciencies

    * Q = why is moral more down + progress more slow? A = there is too much delay

    * cutting the slack

      * slack is sluggishness/lack of energy, not tight or taught, not blowing/flowing at slow speed

      * any activity that absorbs resources but create little to no value

      * missed opportunity before need met

      * what’s necessary vs wasted

    * cripples progress + frustrates team - increases expenses, robs impact

    * why do we have it? it’s a natural evolution of a company/org

      * ornaginatina never drift towards simplicity

      * growth naturally creates complexity + complexity kills growth

    * how do we cut it out?

      * goal = simplify or leliminate all policies/processes, or unnecessary steps that take too much time, cost too much and add too little value

      * bc if we’re overrun with rules, we’ll be bogged down

      * policies = organizational scar tissue (ovveractions to things that will most kilt not happen again)

be careful not to overreact to problems/mistakes or rules + complicated
processes will be created

      * step 1- kill a rule

step 2 - cut a meeting

        * bad meetings are reflections of bad leaders

        * can we get the same result without the meeting

        * can we get a similar or better result without the meeting

        * experiment with freq + duration of meetings

      * step 3 - remove a step 

        * art is the elimination of the uncessary

        * sometimes leaders need to be removed - leaders can tend to hold on to things for too long

      * step 4 - empower a person/team

        * train a few ppl 

      * step 5 - repeat the process

        * only 3 things happen naturally in an org: friction, confusion + under performance - everything else requires leadership

        * great leaders simplify bc growth create complexity + complexity kills growth

    * application questions 1 - what unnecceasy steps unproductive meetings or ineffective policies are slowing the progress?

    * application question 2 - what rule can you kill? what meeting can you cut? what step can you remove? who can you empower? 

    * PK question: where do we have slack?

      * PH: having to wait on volunteers

        * PK - how do we manage volunteers/leaders?  

      * PD: money questions

      * PDS: staff flow

      * CTH: second follow-up to answering questions (communication to wrong person or 2nd ask)

        * PJ: feels he is a 2nd person in many conversations with ministry leaders 

        * WHOEVER IS GETTING AN ASSIGNMENT REALLY NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT THE PARAMETERS ARE

      * PD: waiting for repairs to be done (ex: window repair, answer on when to take down the wall in Revere) or other staff

        * knowledge/understanding slack - afraid to ruin something in the building when taking the wall down

          * empower Washington to help

          * how far can I go with this? how much freedom do I have? am I released to do this?

      * PK Q: how many questions is PJ getting asked that need to get bumped up to PK?

        * PJ A: tons of questions

          * PK Q: are those bc PK needs to make them more clear to PJ or to the rest of the staff? define the parameter more clearly or is there another way ppl need to communicate directly to PK?

            * is there a particular category these questions fall into?

      * clarification of role + categories within it
