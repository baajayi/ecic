#  **01.15.19**

**General Notes - Pastor Joshua**

  * Absent - Hoana (Cadre)

  * WINS

    * Joshua - PJ + Wes were able to control + process thoughts and emotions through writing out lines

    * David - ran into man during outreach moment who hadn’t been coming + came back to service

    * Tanisha - car is inspected + passed AND sex-ed discussion with teenager

    * Danielle - met w/ kid’s mom (child has autism) who hasn’t  come to church who’s husband works in the fire department

    * Carolyn - Abbey updated all addresses + wants to do bulletins

  

  * Calendar Requests

    * PJ - will you be taking vacation in February or April? **ask next week**

    * ARCA - we need to get your 2019 dates

      * 2/2 - **approved** upstairs + downstairs 11a - 4p

      * ACK - allowed to setup beforehand? 

        * what does setup mean? stations out, decorations, turning walls around, games, 

        * PJ - above setup needs to be done after

        * ARCA should be able to except 1st position + return it to 1st position

  

  * Calendar Review

    * ACK - not doing meetup at SkyZone but inviting ppl to the service already in Lynn

    * LEAD mtg: 

      * PD + PDS to give PJ a list of Revere ministry teams to prep for

      * no more postcards needed at this time - PD to follow-up that ministry leaders get them

    * ACCESS: recruit for teams + let PJ know 

    * Conference on the Holy Spirit

      * PT Q: asking if we are scheduling a kids conference at the same time - worried about staffing + kids were upset that they couldn’t attend

      * PJ A: we would have to provide something as an option - bring numbers to PJ during next 1:1 meeting

  

  * Sunday’s attendance

    * reached over 500

    * 2nd service attendance put it incorrectly - PJ to meet with Jonathan this week

    * 2nd week over 90 in Revere - 1 more week will mean it’s our new normal

    * knowing that our starting mark is 500, we will have a legitimate starting number to jump off of with our ‘year of rescue'

  * What would make prayer more meaningful?

    * spend more time together, not intensely

    * if doing breakfast together, Tuesday morning or Friday morning

      * Friday - CTH(staff meeting is stressful), PDS(sound more fun, Tuesdays feel like more of a Monday), PD(better than Tuesday)

      * Tuesday - PT(can’t attend workout class)

      * where would staff want to meet? 

        * CTH - Revere might not be practical for getting back to 

        * PT + PDS - would like to go to a house + would love a dog

        * PD - doesn’t matter

  

  

**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * PR’s last Sunday = 2/10 and last day of work = 2/15

    * not asked to candidate to Grasslands

    * anything else PR is in charge of that staff needs to know

    * he will not leave 2/15 but moving the next week or later

      * CTH - make sure I have all password/usernames

      * PDS - national grid items will need to be pulled back to church name

        * CTH to do

        * find out internet - business vs personal

    * we will not be making a huge deal out of this

      * his role has been different than pastoral staff

      * we will announce + some sort of sendoff (open house)

      * primary concern = church 

      * we’ll have to figure out how to 

      * video? scrapbook? 

      * ppl to make sure they are aware of this: Travis, Stacey, Erika, Brian, fishing, worship team, men’s small group, Thursday AM non-church mom’s group, 

      * this puts them in an awkward spot bc moving + not having a place to go

      * will present as sending them out as ‘missionaries'

  * PD doing walk through with PR - will ask PD to call Roberto (person inviting to rent at Chestnut St $2500 2nd + 3rd floors first/last and they are responsible for all utilities)

    * if he says yes, PD to tell PJ to update the books

    * Roberto needs to sign the lease agreement

    * will need to make an appt w/ PD

    * if wanted to use garage as storage = $300

  * Housing at the mansion

    * met w’ female staff

    * PK realized, from the beginning, the moment we bought Chestnut st, we always had a guest room

    * based on needs, right now, PK sees only using two of the rooms on the 2nd floor for something other than houseingchhrch related purposes 

      * PDS would be the guest room

      * would still leave is with the 1st floor open with PH + war room open 

    * PK isn’t sure if a co-work space would work anymore - would need entire 1st+2nd floor

    * long term idea = well curated 2nd hand/thrift store

    * something that made money, we could control the space, some type of creative idea, 9-5 would be too many hours, more narrowed + focused

  * Book: Ordering your private world - Gordon McDonald (2nd book Reordering your broken world)

  * Theme for the Year - RESCUE

    * while our church has had an outward focus from the beginning

    * over the last 5 yrs we have been able to do a minimal amount of organizational direction towards that - ie general street team, postcards, etc - they are maintaining a certain level of focus

      * therefore we have a culture that is open to new ppl to encounter Jesus

    * THIS year PK wants us to do a really set strong set of attention to focus on outreach, evangelism and ALL that that means

    * we will set a 4DX goal + run for 3-6months

    * PK is not ok for being 500 with ppl frustrate with their churches

    * if we played a certain FB, insta, postcard game we could grab easy ppl in

    * this is NOT what PK is talking about

    * we grew internally w/ follow-up + continuing to get better

    * when we talk about outreach, he means evangelism + evangelistic church growth

    * it’s 180.000 ppl we need to be worried about between the two cities

    * PK understands that makes things messy + complicated bc if they are authentically unchurched, unhealthy, bc it doesn’t take 12sec to unpack

    * and this is exactly where PK is heading us

    * PT Q: what do you think our percentage of church ppl we have grown by?

    * PK A: this yr, we have picked-up quite a few ppl who haven’t been to church in awhile (6months)

    * what are the demographics Lynn most likely to return person

      * connected to someone who comes consistently

      * if kids go upstairs

      * if you have meaningful interactions

      * if outgoing or extraverted

      * when a family-knows personally or connected w/ someone in kids ministry

      * if you make less than $30,000-depends on how you got here (project cope vs steps to solution)

      * some spiritual background (left legalistic spanish church or went to catholic church or have something to compare us to)

      * if someone shares their recovery + Jesus story, giving them something to invite other ppl

    * if in recovery, are you more likely to come back?

      * 2nd time in a row but 3rd time would be in months due to lack of life skills

    * for our family units over $100,000

      * noticing chaos but ok with it bc there is something who is controlling it

      * production-like service

    * on a scale of 1-10….

      * if you are white, what’s your rate of return? 7

      * if you are black American, what’s your rate of return? 2 (less than white ppl) 

      * if you are hispanic, what’s your rate of return? better w/ female, 2nd/3rd generation, less-likely if native language and more-likely if not your native language

      * if you are broken + you know you’re broken? more likely 

        * if ignoring it, you are not more likely to return
