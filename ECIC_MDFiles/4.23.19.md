#  **4.23.19**

**General Notes - Pastor Joshua**

  * Absent: Hoana (personal day) + Pastor Kurt (presbyter meeting)

  * Calendar Requests

    * PJ - personal day 5/7 (CTH to look at)

  

  * Calendar Review

    * John Miller info - correct to make sure it’s correct

    * pastoral appreciation - does it need to be staggered from locations? CTH to ask PK

        

  * event contacts are not to be entered into church metrics

  * PJ Q: what observations from Easter did you have?

    * PT: 1 family from easter egg hunt - mom came + had no desire to stay but wanted her daughter to learn about easter

      * there were many families who were interested in hearing about the easter story but not interested in coming to church

      * there’s been a shift where this isn’t the sunday that’s important to come

      * having a Photo Booth upstairs was a huge win - especially the kids + it didn’t create too much chaos

      * for special Sundays, like Easter, it would do well with switching things up - you can see Easter when you’re there

    * PDS: same thing happened in Revere - a ton of families didn’t show up who are part-time goers

    * CTH: worship set was spot on + the Holy Spirit was moving

    * PJ: in 2nd service, a comeback from years ago (+ someone who was escorted out)

    * PD: we need to do more in the area of decoration in Revere - felt it was plain - it was just a normal Sunday

  

**Tasks:  **

  * _All staff:_

    * Yearly reports for annual business meeting due on 5/21

  *  _Carolyn_

    * Ask if pastoral appreciation needs to be staggered
