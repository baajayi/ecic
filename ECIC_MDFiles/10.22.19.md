    * Take aways from Sunday: (positive)

      * PH - good response from announcement videos - showed they were listening

      * PT - lighting was spot on for announcement video

      * PJ - re surveys - every person asked tabulated - 1off short time commitments are easily filled

      * PT - personally enjoyed ‘getup a talk to your neighbor for 30sec'

      * PT - made a co-leadesrhip team for 3rd service + went well

      * PDS - smaller kid crowd + focused on small group which lead to more participation

      * PD - team is working well together + knowing their roles

        * Emily Maclean has really taken ownership over greeting team

        * 22 registered women from Revere location

        * 14 revere ppl at lead meeting

        * relationships are starting to build

      * PT - picking kids up on Sunday + volunteer has made mornings easier

    * Pastoral Care Policy + visitations 

      * we are trying to 

      * when PK left calvary, though process was that if you’re not in a small group you don’t receive care unless you are about to die

      * Calvary’s policy - somebody will visit you every single day

        * every staff member would have an on-call day + would go straight to visitations

        * would spend the whole day on the road most likely

      * it was clear who would visit so staff wouldn’t pack their schedule with things 

      * we can’t underestimate how important that is for calvary’s mindset + Pastor Tim's

        * pastors touching people - not parishioners 

      * when PK started ECIC, he very much thought that he pushed it back to congregational care - for the most part it has work for us

      * now that we’re bigger, there seems to be moments when we’re missing it + probably not acceptable how we are holding such hard lines on it

      * we are trying to figure out when should we as pastoral staff visit ppl

        * what are the situations

          * emergency “immediate” (wrap up meeting you are in + cancel the rest) - near death, tragic, unplanned surgery (traumatic kind)

      * emergencies: 

        * PJ = near death or just died, nuclear family death of tragedy or generational below you, something unplanned, if parishioners asks staff to become the pastor for their unchurched family, 

        * PH - really back car wreck

        * PD - 

        * PK - physically injured in a traumatic way

        * PT - certain court cases (their children get taken away)

        * someone dying, family/friend death/local + live parents - 

        * does unexpected weigh more that old age?

        * PK Q: what if someone relapses/OD’d? is this an emergency?

          * is it different w/ someone who is 6months clean vs 10years clean?

        * PJ - if we know/find out we’re connected with someone, we need to show up - pastoral neighborhood effect

        * there are the moments when you become ppl’s pastors

        * are there some when we should not?

      * hospital stays:

        * surgery, hemodialysis, physical rehab, chemo, nursing home (not necessarily assisted living), maybe emergency + post-surgical care now, day-surgery, post-birth complications, ICU, 

        * ICU: pastoral visit

        * non-life theratening (overnight stay): pastoral 

        * day-surgery: pastoral phone call w/ potential to meet in the morning

        * chemo: pastoral - once a month (good for staff to do)

        * hemodialysis: pastoral (at the end)

        * frequent flyer ppl: would need to be pushed to congregational care

          * vetting visits?

        * nursing home/shut-ins/LTAC: pastoral 

        * physical rehab: 

          * we may have visited them for surgery + x1 in rehab or something

        * longer term will need to be a mix of pastoral + congregational

          * maybe we’re just supplementing it 

      * celebration visits:

        * child birth: pastoral (praying for the child)

        * graduations:

        * organ transplants: pastoral (but already wrapped in 

      * ALWAYS PRAY AT THESE VISITS

        * anointing oil?

        * staff to make of their own version of a ‘last rights’ prayer

        * book: a minister’s manual

      * Mental Health:

        * emergency: psych suicidal 

        * psych unit: pastoral (congregational should NOT be expected to do) + evaluation

        * addiction rehab: 7/15/30days 

          * teen challenge? yes - early on in the 1st 30days

          * long term programming: some path needs to be created on this

          * what does it mean when someone goes in multiple times

      * Court:

        * will have to define which elements of court require us

        * breaks phone policy of not checking every hour

      * PK Q: does geography matter? yes

        * close by - no

        * Brockton may be too far (Teen Challenge)

        * however, if ppl who have had our investment + are our voting members + early launch team OR we have sent them to a special facility, we will reach out + honor them
