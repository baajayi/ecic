  * CTH Question: what is the wordage we are using for the cafe/lobby? **cafe**

    * **cafe entrance will only be used on Sundays**

  * CTH question: I have a teenager (13yrs old - Atticus Harrington) who wants to attend START dinner. Do we have a philosophy on this? **yes - they are welcome to + if they want to serve w/ PH, they need to go**

    * 15yrs old is probably a good age to 

  * PK read Matthew 21

    * ‘most of the crowd’ - some were confused or didn’t know

    * the ppl who were in Jerusalem proper didn’t know who he was (he was coming outside of Jerusalem)

    * the next time he goes back into the city, he goes back in from the same place for the trial

    * don’t exempt yourself out of holy week - take time to reflect + celebrate what Jesus means

  * The Chosen - will come out on TV slowly (by VidAngel)

  * don’t forget to invite someone to church on Sunday

  * PK Q: how were things in Revere?

    * PD - toilet chaos for PD but otherwise it was fine - it didn’t disturb what was going on in the chapel

      * per Anthony, it had never happened before

      * when did it happen? first time on Thursday in the back + then both on Sunday (plumber snaked it out)

  * PK Q: does everyone have everything they need?

    * PH Q: does it still need to be recorded? PK A: yes it does

    * Need to record worship on Sunday AM to have the worship team see it

    * PH: work w/ Amy to writeup a list on what to needs to be muted when

    * **Rule:** **never turn volume all the way up**

  * Reaumes - haven’t been around 

    * Billy grew up in a Bob Jones culture - fundamentalist christianity - weirdly legalistic

  * PK Q: PD - are you making coffee on Wednesday? 

  * PK Q: PD - are Emily + Danielle the only next level ppl?

    * A: Ana, Jen Fernandez (DR)

    * it is an all church meeting

  * historically we could expect 700ppl on Easter but we can’t really tell what it’s going to be like in Revere

    * Revere needs to be ready to pivot

    * chairs will be taken out on the 2nd floor in Lynn for Sunday

    * its the tail-end of April vacation this year

  * Person living in dumpster last week for a day

    * PK asked CTH to call the police

    * there are two ways to handle the situation

      * 1- ask ‘can i help you?’ but you have to go all the way with it

      * 2- call the police - especially since we know this walkway is complicated

  * Joshua has not been cleared to be back in the building

    * once you’re moved off the premise you are moved off

  * Sunday Issues

    * nobody is allowed to sit in stacked chairs

    * we need to clean ‘back corridor’ up - the room needs to be shutdown immediately

    * ppl can’t just do whatever they want

    * if ppl are walking, show them to sit

    * coming from the cage into the sanctuary, there is a lip on the floor (it’s to code) but is still a little higher than ppl are ready to expect

    * armor bearers + ushers are the only ones who 

      * ABs will be clarified with who can + who can’t 

      * ABs will need to clarify the culture + set the tone

    * PD - maybe putting up temporary walls up would help

  * PK Q: are there any urgent ppl matters? 

    * CTH - Marcial Lugo restraining order up 5/2

    * PT - Stephanie Hernandez + Orlando

    * PK - two weeks ago in church, 3rd service, someone did a stanza in spanish that was not planned

      * **no one does stuff on their own in the microphone on their own that isn’t planned**

  * PH - should we be using PK’s playlist on Sunday AMs?

    * PH Q: are we able to play secular music?

      * there is good or bad music - it’s neither Christian or secular

  * Calvary has a policy that no youth/kids workers can be alone with any children (opposite sex or not)

    * DCF policy - they are ok w/ PT picking up William

  * Barnabas is writing a song - is this something we encourage even if it isn’t on PK’s radar

    * Adam is the one who picks the songs

    * PK doesn’t need to approve it

  * Only talk to PK about Haley
