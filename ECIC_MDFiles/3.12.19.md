  * GLS Review by PJ - Hunger in Paradise (Rasmus Ankersen)

    * success is easy to misinterpret

      * outcome bias: judge a decision based on it’s results

      * end-of-history illusion: we had to grow to get where we are, but we can achieve out next goals without significant change

      * solution: seek the outsider’s perspective

    * lag measures vs lead measures

      * lag measures = tell you if you’ve been successful

      * lead measures = tell you if you will be successful

    * records are made to be broken

      * the best is a moving target

    * there is a denial on congratulating yourself on past achievements without making change for the future

    * don’t assume something will work for you in the future if it has worked previously

    * PJ doesn’t recommend book but points are good - there is a 5min YouTube video that reviews
