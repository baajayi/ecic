**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * CTH reminder - PK would like to talk about Father’s Day (and mother’s day)

    * will probably do the pig roast but not the bull bc it’s too expensive

    * chili cookoff? best pastallitos? ax throwing? (PK to talk to Brian)

  * Mother’s + Father’s Day

    * we need to pick point people for each one

    * Father’s Day - we will keep pig but get rid of the bull (adults aren’t using it + it was intended to be an adult thing)

      * ideas: arm wrestling competition, swing sledge hammer things, hatchet throwing thing (can’t be done safely)

      * any other ideas? car beating, 

      * PK + PJ to make decision/work on assignment + who has what on their plate for both mothers and fathers day

    * still want to do pictures on mother’s day

      * well thought out and get ALL the helpers 

      * not sure if we can do it in the cafe - get a backdrop/red carpet

      * outside or mom’s room

      * highlighting gift - spa idea?

  * thoughts on dip in attendance?

    * weather was compareable

    * for Lynn location: curious factor with room flip - increased social media?

    * no large amount of families missings

    * PJ: baseball + softball will be a complication

      * encourage families to go to another service - even Revere services

  * Easter is coming

    * don’t miss 1-this is a good pulse to see if you know an unchurched ppl 2-if you don’t, this is a good reminder to meet them 3-this is a good time to invite them (not only bc pastor on staff but also bc they are your friend)

    * there is no relational cost - sometimes ppl expect you to invite them

    * we will see ALL kinds of ppl - be sure the ‘doors are wide open'

    * follow-up process - are we doing what we’re supposed to 

      * PJ: we/re hitting 1.5 out of 3: text, letter, cookies

        * PJ to talk to PK during

        * PK wants a chart/something guest, every step along the way, whether it’s been done, and response

        * PK wants to be able to print out + say here is where we are with this person

    * Easter guest thing - important to make sure we’re identifying guest, getting info, 

      * send out email from PK through UCARE “if you didn’t receive an email or postcard from us this week, be sure to update your information"

    * this is a double one day - not a day to take off - our leaders need to own really well

      * show up early + stay late

    * last Easter our 3rd service was quite full

  * Worship Team

    * we have to have a plan for 3rd service - there has to be a drummer at the end of 3rd service

    * we can’t let it slide off because it’s the end of a long day

    * we need a 3rd service team that doesn’t need David + Travis

      * everybody does two: 1st+2nd or 2nd+3rd

      * recenter around current mission w/ PK, PJ, Adam + Kelly

    * substitutes are ok but someone who is promoted needs to be ready to be promoted 

  * Elizabeth from Haven has stepped down (will work until June) + Jamie as well

    * will ask to see if she’ll do 10 hours from home for grant writing

    * Gini will try to salvage keeping Jamie today

    * keep in mind that 10-40hr position is open for grant writer/growth development - NEEDS to be a good writer

  * Mansion

    * any mansion related issues need to be reported to PD - he will run from there

    * PD - make some type of a sheet/spreadsheet that involves cleaning, trash, who’s in charge of the yard

      * figure out what needs to be done weekly, every other week, etc

      * ie: trash, vacuuming,
