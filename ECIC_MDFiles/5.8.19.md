  * Greeting Team Meeting

    * usher greeter crew is not cutting it 

    * from a measurable 

  * attendance report reviews

    * ACK + Nursery Revere: 60 kids have come thru 

      * PDS left most of the ‘fake ppl out'

      * look at drop-off trends + compare to parent’s attendance AND find out on the why or look into finding out the why

      * look into family units

      * visitations, postcards, texting, touch base somehow

      * kids are the easiest group to draw from bc they know where the building is at + get in, it’s just connecting on another level

    * Revere adults: 333 individual ppl have come through

      * take advantage of the 'low hanging fruit'

    * All City Youth: 68 different youth have come through

      * kids that are coming, are coming regularly

      * interesting pockets where ppl where coming for a season + then weren’t - these are good ppl to follow-up with

      * when kids hit senior year, beat them in recognizing they are older by saying “i know you’re going to be older, i need you to be a leader"

    * All City Kids: 304 different kids have come through

      * look at the last quarter + compare to the previous 3

      * did they drop drastically or are there patterns of a couple of months here and then not

      * is it due to a sport? - - don’t take it personally just make sure they come back

      * if the kids that are not regular anymore (reg=12x over the yr) who is not coming in the 3rd service 1-moved to Revere 2-moved to another service 3-fell off routine

    * you have all kinds of data - 

      * attendance is ebb+flow for a lot of reasons

      * we probed to ourselves that ppl want to attend our church - not out of obligation

      * when we hyped up our follow-up process, our contact drove the number higher

      * maybe we need to push in about how we are following up

        * remember this is a heart issue

      * attendance reveals a heart problem or sometimes a problem with us

  * PK + Jen’s vision 

    * our target group has bee 20-40y olds

    * 20yrs have passed + the above are no longer a part of our target group AND we have followed the target group

    * what are 20-40yrs olds like in Lynn + in Revere today? is it the same as 20yrs ago?

    * PK Q: where do millennials get their info on events?

      * PD: Trevor Noah, John Oliver, Ellen, masterclasses on knowledge to share, Steve Harvey (at least in the Cooledge St area), Joe Rogan

      * PH: Twitter or FB or YouTube or Netflix(documentaries), musicians as influencers + movie directors (Get Out), podcasts

      * PT: Shaun King - social media influencer, The Real

    * the word influencer didn’t exist before 1-2yrs ago + millennials 

    * if this is where everyone is getting their info, + the millennial is about getting data, (no newspaper or watching ABC news at night)

      * a home less kid can still stay uptown date as long as he has wifi

    * how do we break into that space in a manner that is legit + open up doors to have an honest conversation about Jesus

      * how do we end with the same goal as servant evangelism?

    * PT: you can’t have real conversation: you can’t control it + the amount of pushback with exclusivity is HIG

      * new tactics are constantly changing - 

      * PK - the technology side will still be here

    * PT: what is the hole that is being left behind when everything is so technology driven

      * “is anyone paying attention to me?"

    * PH: give ppl content so they can then post on SM (ie The Happy Place)

    * PK: are there 100 things we could teach the world in 3 minutes or less?
