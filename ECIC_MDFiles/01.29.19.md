**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * Video - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEJDliThj7g>

  * we have a culture of dealing with issues has always been personally - not very often by text/email

    * it’s clear that we are getting back logged on communication on our new 1:1 strategiy

    * if we start to communicate basic detail stuff it will create some communication rules around that

    * ie - in a meeting, you’re talking BUT in an email you’ll get an assignment + you may want to go back+forth and it might need to be delayed

    * PK is unsure of the details but realizes we are getting back logged + some if this is coming our shifted leadership process + pushing leadership down to ppl BUT what was really happening is PK ws taking a step up and everyone else was also needing to take a step up

      * it provides elevation + ability to see good+bag things better

  * 4DX discussion

    * video description of 4 disciplines

      * 1-focus on the widely important goal (WIG) instead of trying to work on a ton of goals - narrow your focus - there is always good ideas than time to 

        * start, finish, deadline needed

      * 2-act on the lead measures - success based on lag-track success (revenue, profit, satisfaction) lead-track critical + predict the success of the lag measure (diet + exercise lead to wt loss)

        * lags are easier to measure

      * 3-keep a compelling scoreboard

        * keep engagement by knowing the score by letting pl know if they are losing or win the game

      * 4-create a cadence of accountability - rythymn of regular/freq team mtgs that focus on the lead to move the score - commitments drive the score 

    * our lead measures will be outward focused

    * how do we know how we are doing? we will focus on seeing if we are being outward focused as a church is by the number of registered guests every_____

      * this is “a” way - yes there are some flaws

      * we can say approximately this is our adult # of guests (does not include children)

    * what are the things we would need to be careful about?

      * PJ: make a big deal about filling out the connection cards

        * PT: outward focus if they are coming from another church or our other location?

        * ?: are returners a category? (this could be the whirlwind) but this is probably just part of weekly contacts

          * PK - but you do grow with the churched ppl

      * PJ: is literacy an issue?

        * PT: it’s not just a can but a will - VIP starting this Sunday 

        * PK: paper vs app/phone/text could 

      * PK: if the WIG is going to have to do with registered guests, we believe that if we are successfully outward focused, the WIG will go up - how will it go up

      * PD: intentionality of finding first time guests if they don’t go to the VIP table

        * PT: potential challenge = parents aren’t filling out connection cards

        * PK: at next level, you register as a guest no matter where you sign-in - whether kids or adults or location

      * PD: language challenge

      * PD: large visitor Sundays would be important to have a quicker process

      * PDS: connection cards don’t have the space to include family members

      * PT ?: is there a way we can register youth groups on Sundays?

      * PJ: genuine unwillingness to do what ppl are asked; understanding the why behind it

    * what could skew our weekly number? (unintended consequences)

      * PK: a local church splitting / transfers / mass immigration into city

      * PJ: spikes bc our “monthly regular attenders” have never filled out a card / college relationship depend 

      * PJ: not project cope, ryan house (not Lynn residence), sober houses 

        * PK: this is just part of who we are

        * they are reasonably local but not necessarily 

          * these are important ppl but we are not going to build a church with them bc mostly they will not stay

      * every registered guests count - needs to be broken down weekly

        * 1-out of town 2-program participants 3-parents of kids

    * PK: we know if we change out posture + our ppls posture, our number of guests would increase bc it has worked previously

      * PJ: matters how involved PK is in it

    * lead measure would impact the number of guests

      * the most effective way to measure, is the number of registered guests

    * are we comfortable enough to make our number of registered guest part of where the WIG would be?

      * next question = how will we do that?

  

  * Easter 2017 - PK?: what happened with 3/4s

    * someone said they were turned away bc there were not enough workers (Robin Ennis’ step-daughter)

    * Amy Ribado was in charge: Kelly, Marc, Sharon Janus, Robin

    * PT: 1st service person was unwilling to wait for Kelly to come up from worship

      * mom offered to stay + help AND was not taken

      * Mary was hairried

      * she came slightly arm-twisted not as a seeker

    * PK assumed it was Easter chaos

  * Script for the Lucier’s “transitioning to a senior pastor role in Michigan to be near their families"
