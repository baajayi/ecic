**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * Pastoral Care + frequency of categories

  * PJ - has embraced conf been reviewed? 

    * Jen will run point 

    * Jen will oversee Cathy going forward

  * PK Q: has there been any issues with batteries on mansion front lock

    * PD A: none

    * PH: hasn’t noticed anything

  * PK Q: evaluation on sectional meeting - general attitude at tables

    * PH: ppl were engaged + everyone was participating

    * PJ: definitely a good sense of engagement - Judy felt very disconnected from it + took a little bit of time to ‘get the questiohs'

    * PT: Mulu was answering a different question - slightly in the ball park

      * disparity between severance vs quitting

    * PDS: good mix of ppl + good stories of experiences

    * PD: good discussion - good discussion on multiple types of transitions 

    * PK: whenever it comes to transition, generally longer is better -  an agreed upon exit that is good for everybody

      * in some real sense PK lived a 3 year transition plan bc everything got delayed

      * overlap thing was good with Caleb

      * Clark - Caleb transition was different (Caleb might not have understood)

    * PK doesn’t hold staff obligated to fill position - he’d be sad but not hurt which is different

    * Calvary when terminated, wrapped items up quickly w/ a severance plan

      * mainly a bribe to make sure they don’t mess anything up

    * if it’s going to be a healthy transition, two weeks if rough - it can take awhile

      * everyone will have their perspective on if it was a good transition

    * it’s nice if true ministry leaders have time to transition out as well + to who as well

    * pastoral interference - no pastor is allowed to talk to a credential holder from another team without talking to the lead pastor

  

Rhythm of Pastoral Visitation

  * when another church is telling us something

  * Legal Issues (prison, court, immigration issues)

  * Emergency (that will take multiple days)

    * PK Q: frequency?

      * critical care: regular rhythm - immediate visit + 2-3x/week

      * PH: if life or death, 

      * PD: if life or death, if meeting could talk/figure out details of services

      * PDS: if life or death, it depends on the family involvement - if none, then we should be there more

      * PK: your presence is more for the other people especially if there is chaos (beyond prayer)

      * PK: 2-3x/week does not seem like overkill

    * everyone on pastoral staff will have an on-call day

    * PJ Q: do we want one person going multiple times that week who may be leading the funeral - could be beneficial 

    * there will be some level of communication aomng staff

    * more regular rather than less reguarl

  * Hospital Stays

    * on your on-call day you will find out where - the decision will be made for you - googlesheet? 

      * PT Q: on-call phone? PK A- not sure yet

      * mini-van? 

    * non-emergency stuff is limited to once a week

    * long term - nursing home care is probably once a month

      * Calvary does weekly

      * PT: thinks it should be once a week because our quantity is low 

      * PJ: life care could be it’s own thing

    * distance makes a difference

      * local vs long distance

  * Celebration

    * we need to make sure that we get there

    * pray, gift, card

    * within 24 hrs

  * Mental Health

    * psych unit, rehab, long term programs,

    * local stuff - they need to be visited

    * PK doesn’t think we can pre-fab this answer it will need to be decided individually

    * regular phone calls are needed

    * getting there regularly would be good

      * short- term - multiple visits

      * long term - weekly

  * PK is leaning more towards the more side rather than the less side to see how it plays out

  * this model needs to be sustainable for our ministry

  * Legal

    * jail - 1st time/long term - visit at least once

      * 1st time we need to try to get to much faster

      * PH Q: what about the families? 

        * PK A: would need to get put on this list - pastorally you can get setup through the chaplaincy program

      * writing letters should go into this

    * immigration

      * get prioritized

      * this needs to get setup + it would take all day

    * court

      * when a child is taken away, be there for parents that day

        * definition? tragic court case

      * adoption if we are invited

      * violence realm - restraining orders, other crimes, have somebody there (pastor or representative)

      * fighting to get kids back

      * anything connected to kids + court because what we’re talking about it custody

      * somebody is fighting charges (being accused of something)

        * could be case to case - we might support from a distance but others we might not want to be

      * low level stuff we don’t need to be there for - we most likely need to be at a trial
