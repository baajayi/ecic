**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * there is still stuff behind the wall - everything but construction stuff needs to moved after staff meeting

  * 3/3 incident review

    * Josh arrived 40min before service - nothing unusual seen

    * went upstairs twice before 2nd service

    * spent next 20min switching form spot to spot - not unusual but he felt off/on edge to PJ (instinct was to have a convo in advance but it was just an instinct)

    * PJ asked Jon to be available to be extra help if needed

    * moved a couple times during worship - sat down with friends in back (Betsy Angel’s boyfriend - unknown name)

    * during greeting he moved up to front right

    * talking during preaching - PJ asked to be quiet 

    * got agitate, got up, walked into center, sat next to him + that’s when he started talking antagonistically 

    * stood up PJ had to walk him out w/ Jonathan

      * agitated toward PJ specifically + Jon took him out

    * Josh was refusing to 

    * escorted out + apparently just told him to leave + tracked to oxford st

    * Josh comes back up through 2nd floor + escorted back out

    * ppl have to do what you say so be careful as to how you say it - you have to take a second step + know what that step is beforehand 

    * no one should b using the kid’s room bathroom who isn’t a kid, worker or parent

    * bc we know him, we gave him some extra grace - we need to know what the rules are

    * **if we tell someone to do something + they don't, the police need to be called right away + be there before something happens (have ppl present before the final escalation)**

      * **there is a difference between asking someone + telling someone to leave**

    * we need to call the police any time we need to escort someone out “hey, just so you know, we would love an officer to come bc non-compliant

    * we have two goals, they become a danger to the body, they need to be far away from the body, they do not get to have a conversation in to the lobby by coming back a 2nd time

    * why were we talking to someone next to the people

    * PJ Qs: 1-to what degree can I use physical force if they are non-compliant 2-

    * we are trying to serve him well + everybody else as well

    * everybody is welcome (to come and follow the rules)

    * when PK said “escort him out” only PJ moved

    *  ?emergency task force during each service?

    * PK’s should have a mechanism “this person is having some mental health stuff, they need to be in the back by a seat”

    * there should not be random adults on 2nd floor + kid’s room (kitchen use in Revere needs to be clarified)

      * definition of random needs to be clarified - someone without an assigned purpose

      * bathroom usage - not a kids worker “yeah, you need to use the ones downstairs”

**if Joshua comes back in, he doesn’t get to  bring ANYTHING in with him (or
hide stuff) AND he will have an assigned seat by the back door that will not
be interrupted by anyone else**

  

  * two keys for cabinets 

    * give 1 renter to church + 1 copy goes into ECIC key box

    * everything from those churches + ours gets locked up - everything else goes into the basement

  * PK Q: any issues w/ Lopez church?

    * PD A: nothing noted

  * Easter is coming

    * get everyone on board now

    * the only way Revere’s attendance will go up is if you make it go up

    * it was 5-6years before attendance went up in Lynn

    * hit postcards hard 2-3weeks before

    * 90 second invite offering would be good to use as well

    * Easter is automatically fun for adults - may not apply to Revere

      * we could do something fun 

    * PJ Q: could we move the media table + camera?
