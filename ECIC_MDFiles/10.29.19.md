**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * Budget review

    * look at the categories we each oversee to see if items are categories incorrectly

    * hospitality (3=PD, PJ, PD) each of these has a very specific meaning

    * PJ to look at restricted funds:  holy spirit conference, kids camp, kids scholarship, confirm teams is positive, youth convention, 

    * this will be the last time we do this

    * each time we get an expensive report, we need to look at what is and is not ours in categories

      * you cannot put something in someone else category without talking to them

    * if this is not done, credit cards will be taken away

    * if there are categories you think we need, please text/email PK

      * PT, PH, PDS - breakdown board categories

        * how did you spend this year + 

    * make a young adults

  * what do we need to do to get 

    * just using the TV for sound

    * hdmi cord already run

    * drum set - need sd card

      * know what you need to get + order it

  * Youth Sunday

    * this is what PK is asking, he wants the youth worship team to lead all three services and the adults to help

    * the youth are supposed to be highlighted

    * PJ to make sure this happens

  * when PD gone

    * most important part is who will be leading altar call

    * Emily Maclean would handle it better than Anna Bonifacio

    * it would be worth debriefing with Anna how it went

  * PK Q: thermostat all fixed in Revere?

    * PDS: wire was loose + all set now

  * PK Q: college financial planning

    * class to be highlighted at Wednesday by PK

    * handout to be passed out

  * what if, in order to bring on more staff, and be more ministry-wise more portfolio in one direction, what if the 2nd part of the portfolio was income producing 

    * what if the church became the umbrella org that was creating businesses and psuedo-businesses with a significant income so staff could make more money + bring more on staff

    * think about, what do you think in our context, what are highish profitable that the church could create that would be income producing for whatever staff member oversaw that?

    * items to help us with: we have facilities, we have equipment, we have vehicles, we have computers, we have people

    * driver = the larger we get, the easier it is to forget why we are doin what we’re doing bc spending money gets easier

      * but if our core mission is to reach the poor, crippled, blind and lame, then we need to give ourselves the ability to replicate in other cities

    * a version of being bi-vocational

  *
