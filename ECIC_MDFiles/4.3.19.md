**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * CTH reminder - PK would like to talk about annual business meeting

    * 5/15/16, 5/7/17, 5/6/18

    * need date for this year - tentatively schedule for 5/26

  * Network Council 

    * if PK can pull off, will have some staff go

    * would love all staff to go but expensive for all pastoral staff to go

    * staff to pencil it into their schedules

    * Sunday night - could be of no value bc just a banquet (farewell Bob Wise)

    * Monday - communion, Bob’s last message, elections, 

  * Takeaways from Restore + ? if staff prefers one person or multiple

    * PD: very practical

    * PT: helpful to honing in on one person is more helpful rather than just more information - it was more rounded out

      * curious to know how the racial tensions impact them - nothing brought up in sessions

      * felt conflicted between connecting w/ other ministry leaders + our people

    * PK: wants 4 sessions from the guys: 2 in AM and 2 in PM

    * PH: went to the breakout session by the youth pastor fro Jubilee’s church - talked about target filter (how to disciple or train your team)

    * almost 200 ppl - 165 checked in

    * PJ: lunch + sessions were quick

    * our ppl who went: Sarah Hall, Kathy Smale, Amy Velardi, Emily Marrama, Kristina Etter, Travis Alpert 

    * PK: in the future, hand invite certain people?

      * churches uses ARC stuff as is w/ no need to adjust it per Jamie Booth

  * 1:1s

    * they are supposed to be 30min long

    * performance + task focused in nature “am I doing what I am trying to get done?"

    * this is not a pastoral meeting, I’m not sure how to do my job

    * not a skillset or how-to meeting - those need to happen other times 

    * this meeting needs to stay on mission: 1-person life can impact performance (+ bring perspective) 

      * we are coming in with reports on our metrics/measurements

    * PK isn’t sure we know what our metrics are - how do we know we are succeeding at our call/what we need to be doing

    * this something we all need to be figuring out with PJ

    * as a team, our church is moving forward (even if not as quickly as PK would like)

      * in the middle of this positive movement, we still need to do what we are wanting to get done

    * point of theses meetings: these are my goals, this is how I did with that, these are some things i noticed, here are some obstacles, and getting feedback/direction

    * we don’t want to be constantly be moving the ball week to week / changing of the goals

    * philisophical questions might be moved into our weekly staff meetings

    * sometimes you may ask a question and you may be told to just answer the question yourself, but not on the spot

      * “good question, come back next week with your thoughts"

      * will be important as we move forward that we are self-equipping ourselves

    * PK would like to know - as PJ feels more like a boss now (since we are reporting to him), how do we make sure that _spiritual formation/discilpine_ is still occurring in all of our lives in a manner that you are ok spiritually - what are the things that spiritually work for us individually?

      * there are several online women’s groups like this

      * PT: answer different now than when came on staff - felt she had to figure it out on her own

        * small online group - leader was pastoring her + now going on Sunday to a new mentor

        * reading a book together

      * PD: sometimes doesn’t know what he needs until something happens until he realizes he sees the growth afterwards

        * attending conference for self (not being a pastor to do anything)

      * PH: how the academy was setup - asked the right questions + had ppl who could notice something 

        * needs to have 1day alone to recharge

      * PDS: coming back to 3rd service w/out responsibilities - still feels like PJ is pastor w/ PD as boss

        *   

      * PJ: reading books w/ ppl, having some kind of outside perspective, personal truths (24hrs with no assignments + alone w/ self)

        * have to be something other than a church service but if at a spiritual conf can be in the moment rather than evaluating

      * PK: it is extremely important to have peer level who are spiritually positive for you - they don’t need you pastorally but rather you need each other as friends

      * focusing on 3 different tracks: spiritual formation as a team, skillset development and performance related matters

        * as the team has grown, it has become more difficult

        * skillset development: investigating to give everyone a coach

      * larger churches are looking into staff pastors - a pastor for the pastors

    * who are you tracking with as an author in spiritual formation 

      * PT: Soul Keeping by John Ortberg, Strengthening the soul of your leadership, Dick Brogden - daily devotional emails

      * PD: Fresh Wind - Fresh Fire, One Thing by Gary Keller, 12 Rules for Life, Ben Shapiro’s podcast

      * CTH: The Best Yes by Lysa Tyerkurst, Remembering God by Annie F Downs

      * PH: listening to Christine Cane

      * PDS: leadership podcast by Craig Groschell

    * would you rather read a book or listen to a book?

      * PD: depends on if it’s the author that is reading the audiobook

      * PDS: read 

      * PJ: depends - capture details better reading and listen gets the big picture idea

      * PT: if spiritual-read leadership-listening 

  * annual business meeting

    *
