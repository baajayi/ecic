**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * Can I ask John to make a half door for the nursery? - Danielle 

    * **PK A: we need to get a dutch door over there - PK will meet w/ him + figure out the details**

  * Business meeting - unanimous vote on catalyst housing 

    * with votes like this, it is best to have as close to as unanimous vote as possible

  * General Council - PK Q: what were ppl’s opinions? reflections?

    * PH: good to know who people were, learning about voting process

    * PT: it must be easy to be a white man in our section + there are certain ppl who aren't connected who would have a hard time connecting with others bc they are new to the network 

    * PJ: can see the value of a denomination school + surprised that there isn’t some sort of mixer to find ppl to give you life

    * PK: was surprised at where Doug Clay’s plan + agenda is

      * Clay’s committing his time in these categories: 1-biblical literacy 2-missions participation 3-spirit empowerment

    * PDS: enjoyed connecting with ppl who she hasn’t seen in awhile + Doug Clay’s honesty/rawness with school debt issue

  * No-one from another church should be reaching out to our people unless it comes through PK

  * PK Q: Why did attendance go up in Revere?

    * PD: Scott Halley has been inviting a ton of ppl, weather being nice? 

    * CTH: increase due to Project Cope/Ryan house? 

    * PJ: two weeks ago MOther’s day + Easter relatively close - are holidays becoming less impactful?

    * PH: more ppl posted Mother’s day photos online tagging our church

    * PK: our lows are becoming higher - felt like the opposite of ppl going away

  * Instagram discussion

  * Weekly Contacts

    * at the core of your minty portfolio, the items that are absolutely essential are the 100 contacts a week + your meetings with your leaders

    * 100 contacts is supposed to be the minimum - not the maximum - it needs to become natural

    * if you are having a hard time making that number, this could be a growing point

    * these do not need to be 30min conversations - touching base about a situation, mostly text messages, 

      * ie: Brian working at Procopio + not losing his job across the street bc of accident

    * in a real way, FB + instagram are real tools to help with contacts

      * not naughtiness but bdays, anniversaries

    * don’t worry about contacting

  * Coaching 

    * PJ will start talking this in 1:1s 

    * give an opportunity to grow in leader formation, with Randal’s company 

    * meeting every other week + will start scheduling meetings in June (6months to start)

    * this will focus on leadership

    * you are in front of somebody who will help you navigate through - not an expert

      * a regular question from them will be “what are we working on today?"

      * we will be leaving the meeting and doing the work

    * this is not going to school/college class

    * reporting to PK + PJ on what staff is working on
