**General Notes - Pastor Kurt  **

  * Construction Update

    * crazy for the next couple of days - moving faster than expected

    * PH - PK asked to take down media stuff before heading to Revere bc it’s in the way

    * approved money wise for part that is needed for 2nd floor

      * approved for new XLR cords - make sure old cords are thrown away

  * Revere Sunday check-in

    * kids attendance was low

    * PK Q: what is PDS noticing trends? A: haven’t expanded yet

    * PK Q: how many visitors have you had in a couple of months PDS A: none

      * everything you do needs to be focused on programming being outward focused

      * its easy and complicated for kids to bring friends to church (combo of parents + kids)

  * Project Management discussion (continued)

    * projects have lots of tasks in them

    * projects can be 3days, 3years to complete

    * PK’s longest is October 2021, PK wants ppl to move into out 4th floor housing

      * so the tasks that have to take place

      * of those 1000s things, PK only understood about 10

      * knew Lynn political ppl + consulting group would help

        * PK knew who would know what to do

        * one task was to find out what to do - contact a contractor who knew what to do

        * PK met this guy 4yrs ago at a breakfast meeting in Peabody - Andrews

        * met 3/4 times before he was convinced we had the political connections (he’s never been able to break into Lynn)

    * small projects: YouthCon, flipping main aud, egg hunts, conf on the holy spirit

    * common mistake - PK sees that projects need to be planned out at first

      * finding out what I need to do

      * **think with the end in mind - what’s the goal?**

      * in some type of brainstorming session (mindmap/apps/post-it notes) use something that is editable 

      * not locking yourself in yet with order of steps bc you don’t know yet (you may need to reorder)

        * you’re putting all the information out there

    * with complicated projects, they have multiple tracks

    * ACTION STEP: if it takes more than one task, it is a project 

      * take time to plan the project so you can be successful at it

      * don’t procrastinate bc with our work schedules, you can’t guarantee you’ll have free time when you originally planned for it

        * we’ll have floods, funerals, etc

    * it will be helpful to not look at the large end goal (which can be overwhelming)

    * PK Q: what are the biggest challenges you guys are facing?

      * PT A: will freq set it deadline but then the urgent will cloud out + its easy for the now to change the urgency

      * PK - having your schedule mapped out, will help with project management + tasks

      * PH A: prioritizing - tries to do the easy stuff first or the stuff I think is fun

      * PK - early on in ministry, 20% is spend on the stuff you love to do + 80% is spent on the stuff so you get to do the fun stuff

        * 1-influence becomes greater to work with other ppl + 2-you learn to like things you didn’t always like before

        * at 200ppl, PK had to learn to like other things

          * PK had to make the intellectual decision (and emotional + spiritual) bc this is what is best for the church which was a highest value + brought himself into alignment

    * PK Q: is there anything we can do to help remove obstacles that are in your way?

      * PH A: would like to vision for what is wanted for the project on things that are outside portfolio / have a clear understanding

        * PK - enough of a pause of the objective - to clear it

    * the way we communicate will need to change for the sake of time

      * we need more communication but it needs to take less time

      * what we should and should not be communicating and where/how

    * the app Slack organizes your tasks + communication on projects
