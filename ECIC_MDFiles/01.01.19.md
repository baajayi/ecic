**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * 2018 review - definitely felt a lot different 

    * ministry take-aways from 2018 (valuable lesson, etc)

      * PK: it’s ok to wait for our people to be ready

      * PJ: on-going conversations with leaders have shown they are already thinking about + reflecting on it more, without reflection on it, they didn’t have the mental space to dream, think, process; the ppl who serve the most, need to be pastored the most

      * PD: surprised how ppl were drawn to Revere launch, the experience of being at one of our services is more important than trying to tell them about it; 

      * PT: watching how ministry really has a power to ignite ppl beyond their regular lives + what they are willing to give (and how life giving it can be); benefitting from the books that leaders above are reading

      * PH: learning what best helps ppl and how to organize things better; training Carlos with video-editing

      * PDS: find it interesting how ppl see her as an influential person in their lives; figure out how to step into pastoral roles in their lives

      * CTH: role-defing: when I delegate more, I have more time to support PK

      * PK: his decisions have a much greater impact as the team grows so his willingness to experiment/take a risk on something impacts everyone (not just PK, Jen, Joshua) - he now needs to consider the ripple effects

  * New Budget Starts Today!

    * every bit of previous financial information needs to be removed + is no longer valid

    * staff will most likely will have questions

    * google spreadsheet = Chart of Accounts (chart to be color coded to help us 

    * expenses have to match your income

    * staff to get monthly reports on what spent

    * we will need to have a level of flexibility in discipline in recognizing that if an opportunity of a lifetime comes up but not within budget, still ask about it

      * we are allowed to change this budget - it’s ok to communicate the consequences

    * new expensive setup + report to this new chart of accounts

      * we will create sub-categories for 2020 to help see where the money actually goes

    * permissions to spend money: 

      * ask during your 1:1

      * PK the money is yours to spend but the first few months we need to get permission to spend it

      * because we don’t have the month over month actual budget 

      * meaning if you have $4000, you can’t spend it all in January

    * if you want to save money, you need to put it into a reserve category

    * with a budget in place, we cannot make financial decisions on the fly

    * we have to check ALL out expenses 

    * if surplus in budge?

      * probably won’t have it

      * perfect world, it gets rolled over

      * imperfect world, gets zeroed out

    * ACK-Lynn eats curriculum costs for ACK-Revere

    * we are not allowed to swap amounts between accounts - this is board approved + they will be watching what is spend when/where

    * 4 basic categories- 

      * administration: only control we have is how much we use stuff

        * subscriptions: canva, spotify, etc

        * stamps for metrokids = would come from metrokids not office postage

        * 3-4 postcards a week = admin

        * strategic/outreach = individual budget

        * 5000 mailer would come out of outreach

        * printing: everyone should be printing in B+W

      * FACILITIES:

        * general + then all locations

        * locations are not responsibile for maintenance + renovations on a day to day basis financially 

        * replacing roof = renovations (something we are strategically doing)

          * makes it better

        * one of the locks break = repair

          * returns to previous standing 

      * OPERATIONS

        * 3 categories: central, lynn, revere

        * central hospitality: mainly PK

        * resources = books for leaders/volunteers or self (if you are buying it for yourself) (a resource to give somebody - not staff)

        * staff training = 

        * not enough money 

          * 1-take a close look at what  

          * 2-there are some costs that are somebody else's budget (PD asks PDS to take someone out to coffee: it would come out of Revere hospitality OR if own decision-ACK Revere)

        *   

      * STAFFING

        * if you bought stool/blanket/etc is considered housing allowance but you need to say in advance, I’m spending $1000 per year on housing related costs, say that, will not have to pay income tax + will be removed on W2 (hides it from the government)

        * staff is ordained through the church for tax purposes

        * there could also be unique tax strategies available 

        * each staff member will be getting raise + 6months in, the board will ask if a forced retirement account

        * PK camp expense = camp/convention/retreat (this is for major events)

          * for minor events, budget them into event cost (pizza night - everyone brings $3

      * RESTRICTED

        * = money comes in + money comes out

        * should be zero or positive at the end of it

        * ex = camp, what is our cost from what we charge (include ALL costs)

        * kids + youth scholarship funds

          * both locations? 

          * PK wants to be involved in the decision making - doesn’t want to make payment plans + end up 'loaning' money after the event if

          * if we’re doing a kid fundraiser, its with both locations (if on Sunday, do it in both - if not, could be combined)

          * could promote separately around the time of signing kids up

        * missions fund - if someone gives a large chunk, it allows us to have a place for us to decide where 

        * teams

          * metrokids with teams included here

            * hopefully it will cover across the board

          * metrokids without teams

            * if we have a bunch of teams, there will always be left over

          * if there are no teams, we have to figure it out

          * staff are able to recruit teams w/ bonus added on still 

          * $300 per person ($200 for kid - $100 to staff member)

        * Speed the Light - needs to come through the church instead of directly to SNEMN

          * it needs to be reported + end up for personal end of year giving report

  

  * Two major decisions that need to be made

    * who is in charge of the mansion

    * who is in charge of teams or how do we distribute it

  

  * Staffing Question:

    * with Roy + Rob going off staff, 

    * from a staffing perspective, what type staff addition would be most helpful to you/your ministry? pastoral? admin? 

      * PT: maintenance 

      * CTH: male pastor + admin + maintenance/facilities

      * PH: media: tech side (not creative side) + tech maintenance

      * PDS: 

      * PK: fancy custodian (quotes)

      * PD: maintenance team, tech skills in Revere, bring in an old retired missionary couple

      * PJ: more staff times towards media, Lynn pastoral care

    * pastoral staff taken away from PD:

      * young adults, pastoral care, new believer meetings, 1st times guests
