      * come back to next week once PJ decides if taking vacation in February or April

    * Conference on the Holy Spirit (( PJ’s goal = our ppl to connect more deeply with the holy spirirt to be surrendered more, to be empowered more to the holy spirit )) 

      * PT: brother Munley - great speaker, good balance of theology + practical teaching, open to spiritual stuff // Pastor Elizer Perez from Crossroads // our ppl who have decided to stay in their comfortable zone instead of give up something, the need to push beyond that zone // 

      * PH: 

      * PD: come to a clear understanding what being anointed looks like in our context (answer-sometimes it’s doing the work - there wasn’t a moment where PK said you are chosen, along the way you get a sense that you’re part of the team - the mission defines how in you are)

      * PDS:

      * PJ: our ppl need to be baptized in the holy spirit so bad

        * PK - ppl need to know why they need to be baptized

      * PJ Q: what do our ppl need? PH-healing, rescue //  

      * PJ Q: if you were to lead one session, what would you talk about? PH-owning up to being anointed everyone has gifts + stepping up to gifts

        * PT: discern the voice of the holy spirit

        * PK: only if you are not consistently reading the word of God

    * A: PT-hasn’t decided, 

    * PK will be there the whole time

  * PK Q: tell what we have going on right now with our ppl that I don’t know about

    * when Mace’s come back, a real conversation needs to take place - not healthy to do this or to run

      * if there is a legal statement that has been declared by the courts, Sharon needs to do that or have no contact with Faith - she can’t use the church as a run-around

    * Michele Lestrad - back for a 2nd weekend in a row - f/u

  * this past Sunday’s sermon was believer focused but a number of unbelievers interacted w/ PK afterwards bc they were moved

    * PJ - after each service amongst our fringe folks, something was happening in the room - had a bunch of conversations with ppl

  * PK Q; what are some themes + trends? 

    * PD: brazilians that don’t want to attend brazilian church

      * PK - this happens in cultural + language churches

    * PT - a number of MIAs but unsure why 

  * statistically, all of the church prognosticators show decreased attendance patterns with regular attenders

    * means most churches have grown more than what expected if the average attenders has decreased

    * we’re fighting against ppl substituting a good spiritual practice for unnecessary distractions (kids sports, work, entertainment culture)

    * PJ - many churches have a focus of a social scene - not missional

      * PK response - the person still has to authentically want to go to church

  * we are on the cusp of the 100 breakthrough in Revere!

    * keep praying for it

    * PJ Q: what’s the next big barrier?

      * hitting it three times and then 120 + 200

  * anytime a leader makes the decision to transition, it’s important to make sure they leave well

  * appears to PK that worship team is definitely (Adam) trying to implement structural changes as asked

    * make sure it isn’t only on Sunday mornings before going on stage
