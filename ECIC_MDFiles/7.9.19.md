**General Notes - Pastor Kurt**

  * Joshua is gone, anything that is normally run by him can be run by PK 

  * Beyond walls - build a long relationship with the leaders of beyond walls, they all need Jesus 

  * Roof is almost done- was leaking last Saturday in kitchen and hoana’s room

  * ACY worship takeover? Possibly in Oct

  * When pointing while preaching, don’t point to the top screen, point to the sides 

  * Weekly bridge hasn’t been going out every week - last time was June 11 

  * Katie Lozano thinks she is still signed up for Israel Trip 

  * Lesson from the week - if you have a formal meeting (anything with a vote), keep formal notes 

  * Bobby asked about being a youth worker - PK is meeting with him today at 11:30 , He needs to be consistent 

  * Can admire bring people from his church to mens retreat? - No, it’s full 

  * Should we be involved with reach the beach in revere? - it doesn’t fit our standards, there is relational value
