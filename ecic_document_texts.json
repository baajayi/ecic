["[Music] in a broken and chaotic world there is one truth that remains the truth that love is stronger as the world begins to re-emerge after two years of confusion in whatever state you may find yourself in please join us at east coast international church to discover and embrace this love [Music] happy easter everybody happy easter great to have you with us today those of you joining us online in revere hello from lynn today i want to say thank you it's been a exciting weekend good friday service uh our time of meditation and yesterday we had our giant easter egg hunt that was great down at eastland little league thank you for all of those who volunteered and filled eggs there was some good stuff in there i might have taken a couple the uh so it was it was good um and for those of you that are uh relatively new with us here at east coast international church maybe you started coming during the pandemic or in the last few months and you haven't been to one of our start lunches we have a start lunch next sunday right after church right after the second service here in lynn and we'd love to have you join us for that please sign up in the church center app or on your way out of the service today this service is going to be fun the service is going to be fun all right all right so so you're allowed you're allowed to have some fun with this today in my life i have spent an unusual amount of time for most people in graveyards as a child i would accompany my father to multiple funerals he was a pastor also and graveside ceremonies and every holiday with family would eventually seem to hold the traditional drive to the cemetery to visit the graveside of some loved ones that had passed and today in my role as pastor i'm in a lot of graveyards as well and the same thing happens every single time that i go into a graveyard the same thing everything is just like it was before i got there and then when i leave the graveyard the same thing happens everything is still the same it's just normal but it turns out that i know somebody who has a track record of going into graveyards and messing everything up like who is it we need to go get him it's jesus and today we're going to talk about three graveyards of jesus the first one is the graveyard of the demoniac each night throw yourself back 2 000 years and each night jesus would go to sleep in his town where he was living called capernaum and where he would sleep he was right on the edge of the water right on the edge of the lake they call it the sea of galilee in the bible but it's really just a lake it's the lowest freshwater lake in the world and it's surrounded on all sides by rapidly elevating hills and cliffs that create this sound effect this amphitheater effect and during quiet moments you can hear things literally from the other side of the lake and the scripture tells us that there was a man on one side of the lake the opposite side of the lake from where jesus was mark chapter five verse three it says this man lived in the burial caves the graveyard and could no longer be restrained even with the chain whenever he was put into chains and shackles as he often was he snapped the chains from his wrist and smashed the shackles no one was strong enough to subdue him day and night he wandered among the burial caves in the hills howling and cutting himself with sharp stones each night when jesus was trying to sleep thank you i believe that he could hear jesus would try to sleep and he could hear the howling of this demoniac this man in the graveyard that was howling in an agony and jesus could either hear it in his ears or he could hear it in his spirit that there was a man in trouble that the devil had gotten a hold of and this man was just like any other person we might meet today except something had happened in his life maybe he had been married and had a family and things didn't work out maybe he could have been abused as a child and now the demons of his past have come back and tormented his soul maybe he's been informed of the fact that he has a terminal disease and he just went to a very dark place or maybe he started experimenting with a little weed a little wine and a little meth to hide the pain and pabam just like that his life is out of control and bit by bit he's opened himself up to spiritual forces that he was not fully aware of and the demonic comes in and in fact the scripture tells us that he had thousands of demons whatever his trauma was life has simply become too much to deal with for this man and jesus was on the other side of the lake and he just couldn't let it go so after a long day of teaching and ministry jesus gets into a boat on purpose and he makes his way to the other side of the lake it's nighttime and the devil knows something's different something's up why is jesus going to the other side of the lake this is the wrong side of the lake for jesus it's a place where satan was in charge so satan tries to kill jesus before jesus can make his one one and a half hour sale over to the other side and so satan does something very interesting he sends a giant and rapidly forming storm to try to kill jesus while he's in the boat this storm is so ferocious it terrifies his disciples his disciples his followers the the guys they are they are sailing the boat across this lake and as soon as jesus got in he was exhausted plus he had some work to do on the other side so he took a nap mark 4 39 when jesus woke up in the middle of the storm it's raging around jesus is just sleeping he rebuked the wind somebody said rebuked he rebuked the wind and said to the waves silence be still that's how i feel with cell phones that go off in church on sundays the uh so yeah is my cell phone off i should make sure your cell phone's off now okay um sometimes i say silence silence so rebuked in silence suddenly the wind stopped and there was great calm the words rebuked and silenced are really important jesus was talking to the storm like it was alive because jesus understood that the storm was satanic in nature so he rebuked it he spoke to the demon storm with the ferocity that communicates your days are numbered jesus is kicking devil butts and he's just getting started that's what's that that's the tone you need to understand the tone to satan he is saying i'm coming for you and i'm going to destroy all your works so jesus is on the way to the graveyard to change a life and it won't be the last time so they finally get to the other side of the lake and this poor tormented man in the graveyard rushes to meet jesus mark 5 7 with a shriek he screamed why are you interfering with me jesus son of the most high god in the name of god i beg you don't torture me then jesus demanded what is your name he replied my name is legion this is the demons talking now because there are many of us inside this man then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place there happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby send us into those pigs the spirit beg let us enter them so jesus gave them permission the evil spirits came out of the man entered the pigs and the entire herd of about 2 000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water what an interesting turn in that story this created quite a stir in the community a lot of people didn't like jesus for this and honestly if jesus steals all your bacon you might have some issues with jesus [Applause] don't touch my bacon verse 18 jesus is taking off now the man has been totally set free as jesus was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him but jesus said no go home to your family i gotta love this part he had a family imagine imagine what that family had been going through for years tell them everything the lord has done for you and how merciful he has been so the man started off to visit the 10 towns of the region and began to proclaim the great things that jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed at what he told them now notice this notice how the grace of god shows up in the graveyard of this man's life and jesus did not say to the man you are such a fool why did you let this happen that's not what jesus did there was no shame with jesus he simply delivered him and set him free why because jesus loved him and in case you have forgotten this or never heard it in case you need to be told for the first time or last time jesus loves you he loves you today he's always loved you and he is trying the graveyard moments of your life to rescue you to restore you and to redeem you and you might feel today like this man in the story howling in the graveyard you might feel and connect with that worthless feeling or bound up or betrayed or confused but the resurrected jesus that we celebrate today is here and if you will let him he wants to change everything in your life the author in mark is painting a profoundly pitiful picture of this devil-controlled life this man had often been bound with fetters and chains but he broke them and no man no human agency could tame him they called the authorities to deal with him but they could not stop him or help him the social service programs couldn't do it the rehabs couldn't help him the criminal justice system with its first time intervention program was of no use because this man's problem was of a demonic source and let me help you with this today when you've got a bunch of demons all up inside of your head or under your bed don't make friends with them you'll quickly learn that you cannot solve supernatural issues with natural approaches it simply takes inviting jesus into the graveyard area of your life and inviting him to set you free because jesus is stronger than the storms that rage around you jesus is stronger than the chains that bind you jesus is stronger than any addiction that has you as its slave and jesus is stronger than all the situations that you've gotten entangled up in and today jesus is still walking into graveyards and setting captive spree [Applause] and if you want jesus to walk into the graveyard in your life run to jesus and he'll set you free amen now a couple years go by a couple years go by and jesus walks into another graveyard 90 miles away this time a close friend of jesus name lazarus had died when jesus arrived at bethany he was told that lazarus had already been in his grave for four days that means he's definitely dead when jesus saw mary the sister of lazarus weeping and saw the other people wailing with her a deep anger somebody say anger the anger welled up within him and he was deeply troubled where have you put him he asked them they told him lord come and see then jesus wept that's fascinating he you don't often think of this side of jesus jesus was deeply grieved and weeping the loss of his close friend but before that he was angry angry we can understand how anger emerges in these moments from the sorrow and weight of grief that he is feeling that his friends are feeling but you have to ask the question who is jesus angry at is he angry at the people for grieving is he angry at their lack of faith no that's not what's going on jesus is angry at the one who brought death into the world death you see was never to be part of the plan for mankind but sin at the deception of satan brought it into the human situation jesus is angry at the devil and you could almost feel the resolve building in the heart of jesus if this were a movie this is where the the music would change all right it would get really really intense and aggressive and if you could peek into the mind of jesus at this moment you could you could see the just going in his mind it'd be like this means war let's blow this thing wide open let's go verse 38 jesus was still angry as he arrived at the tomb a cave with a stone rolled across this entrance roll the stone aside jesus told them but martha the dead man's sister protested lord he's been dead for four days the smell will be terrible there's always one in the crowd the smell will be awful jesus responded didn't i tell you that you would see god's glory if you believe so they rolled the stone aside then jesus shouted lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet bound engraved closed his face wrapped in a head cloth jesus told them unwrap him and let him go [Applause] this it's a great moment this is my favorite story in the bible so is the other story here we go here you got lazarus let's picture it walk it out of the graveyard and the friends and family of lazarus like they're out unwrapping their stinky and formerly dead friend i love this part jesus accomplishes so much in this moment satan is now on notice that the end has come for him his rule and dominion are no longer going to go unchallenged and stinky people everywhere are welcome to follow jesus [Applause] you can put that on the youtube thumbnail jesse right there stay here no matter how much satan has ravaged and destroyed a life a marriage a friendship a future if the devil has completely destroyed a person's life even if they stink like death or sin or poverty or illness or brokenness jesus welcomes all the stinky and wants to bring them all back to life and today he wants to resurrect your hopes and dreams and he wants to empower you to be more than you could have ever imagined in the graveyard moments of your life when all hope has been lost when the stink of sin and despair and disappointment consume you invite jesus into those graveyard moments of your life because jesus still brings dead things back to life jesus is stronger than the chains that bind jesus is stronger than the stinketh that stains so bring your stinky selves to jesus this easter sunday [Applause] i don't smell i don't know now a few days later after this moment a few days later jesus shows up at another graveyard two down one to go once again jesus can hear the howling of a sin-soaked world past present and future you can hear the howling of those who are experiencing the scourges of satan as a result of his illegitimate rulership of the world and once again jesus heads out on a rescue mission to another graveyard this time he comes down palm sunday road to the cheers and accolades of tens of thousands of people and just a few days later he willingly surrenders himself to the roman authorities jesus is falsely accused his perfect and sinless jesus the crowds they call for his execution the authorities they mock him they place a crown of thorns upon his head to humiliate him and to torture him they whip him multiple times with a metal tipped whip over and over and over and over again they would whip him and bruise him and rip the flesh off his back they make jesus carry the wooden cross through the crowds that he will ultimately be executed on and they will nail his hands and his feet to that cross and watch him slowly and painfully bleed to death there we have jesus hanging on a cross all our hopes and dreams now dead they bring his body down from the cross and they prepare his body to be laid in a tomb a burial cave now it's not obvious from the story but what you don't automatically understand is that jesus was crucified in a graveyard that's amazing for this sermon because jesus has a track record of doing some crazy things in graveyards just like when jesus went to the graveyard to rescue the howling demoniac just like when jesus went to the graveyard to raise up lazarus from the grave jesus now goes to the graveyard to rescue you and me see friday night was dark saturday night even darker but sunday was different mark 16 saturday evening when the sabbath ended mary magdalene mother the mary the mother of james and salmon went to and purchased burial spices so they could anoint jesus body very early on sunday morning just at sunrise they went to the tomb on the way they were asking each other who will roll the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb but as they arrived they looked up and saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled away when they entered the tomb there was a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side the woman was shocked but the angel said don't be alarmed you are looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified he isn't here he is risen from the dead look this is where they laid his body what what just happened our hero jesus who was unjustly executed is now no longer dead and for jesus this was just another graveyard miracle as the worship team comes up jesus has turned this ultimate graveyard into a garden of resurrection a garden where hopes and dreams can be reborn a garden where you and i can be restored a garden where you can be forgiven a garden where you can be set free spiritually jesus was the sacrifice for our sins but that's not all this was part of an even bigger spiritual conflict the battle to overcome the kingdom of darkness and to allow the kingdom of god jesus was crucified [Music] descended to hell defeated satan and destroyed the power of death and he rose from the dead that my friends is why easter is such a big deal easter means not only can you be forgiven but you could come alive truly alive even if it's for the very first time because jesus is stronger than the chains that bind you and jesus is stronger than the stinketh that stained you and jesus is still today stronger than death and it gives us all the opportunity to have a bright hope for tomorrow why don't you stand with me as we close today [Music] across the room let's just take a moment to respond to close your eyes and bow your heads [Music] i wonder which of these graveyard moments you connect with most today you connect with the man who's tormented in the graveyard [Music] do you feel like his story is a description of parts of your life if that's the case today then just like the demoniac you need jesus and you need jesus to set you free jesus can and will [Music] maybe you can relate to the people around the tomb of lazarus maybe life has slipped into a place of despair your dreams and hopes have died that's where you connect today maybe you need to ask jesus to raise you back to life give you a clean slate and start over or maybe you found yourself in a place where you need to set aside those foolish things and falsehoods and that you need to simply embrace the forgiveness and leadership of jesus forgiveness of your sins leadership of jesus in your life where you just surrender it all and let jesus [Music] give you a brand new life as a worship team leads us [Music] however you connect today let's spend some time in our own words praying and inviting jesus into the graveyard moments of our life he can set us free the altars up here are open maybe some of you need to come out and spend some time in prayer today just giving it all to jesus right now let's go", "[Applause] all right good morning everyone good to be with you today last week Pastor Jesse uh was here and he uh always is trying to one up me so that's that's just how it is I guess um but one of the things he talked to you about was our community center that we are developing right across the pedestrian walkway and the so I just give you some uh info on that that is happening that is uh we should be S we supposed to sign on the building already but there's always delays with these things and so hopefully in a couple of weeks uh we will take possession of that property it's a big moment for us because it'll give us quite a bit of uh control over the space here in downtown Lyn uh we can prevent certain exploitive things from happening and we can create good things uh at the same time which is a a unique position for us to be in and uh this is not a free project it's not like they're just handing us the building so there will be uh a campaign here next month about helping us to to pay for that project coming up but there's another project that we are working on that in many ways is already front-ended on the financial cost of it and uh if you just happen to have a multif family house that you are selling please let me know all right uh in the city of Lynn or if you happen to be a landlord in the city of Lynn and have lots of Studio or one-bedroom apartments please let me know we need uh 20 we need 24 we need 24 units uh immediately and so that would be really really helpful if you have it so if you don't know don't tell me about somebody you know like I'm only talking if you know otherwise I'll have like 5 thou I know a guy that I don't want the guy that's going to sell me his house out of the back of his trunk all right so that's where that's where we're at so uh help us with that and pray for us accordingly as well as we try to tackle some housing issues here in the city of Lynn so the first 30 years of my life uh some of you are old enough to know about this others of you are not so watch enjoy this uh trip down memory lane or this exposure to something new and weird uh the first 30 years of my life if I wanted to go somewhere I had to ask for directions you you looked into a a giant book called The Yellow Pages and uh really this is true you you you would say Okay I want to go to a restaurant so you would open up the El pages to the restaurant category and there would just be names of restaurants uh there and it would give you the address and the phone number for those restaurants and and since you didn't have Google to help you out you would actually do something that is really unbelievable that people used to do you would pick up the phone and call the restaurant not not text not message not direct message an actual phone call to another human being from one human to another human and you would say to this human hello I'm looking for directions to your restaurant the person on the other end of the line would then enter into a back and forth conversation with you where they would figure out first where you were and then if they didn't know then you'd have to explain where you were and then they would try to help you arrive at their establishment where you didn't know where it was either you can see the potential flaws in this this plan okay but either way you would get into your car with your scribbled down notes and directions and knowing where to go and you would go off into the great unknown in inevitably you would get lost and you would find yourself doing the Walk of Shame into a gas station to ask the attendant to help you get unlost he this is just how it was back in the day back in those days the real job of the gas station attendant was not to watch out for the snacks and red bulls rather it was to help people find their way when they were lost they were the ancient sages of the highways and back roads of every town in America in the last century now if you were real fancy you would get yourself a book of maps for the whole country and you would look with a magnifying glass and try to figure it out or if you had triaa you could and you're going on a road trip you could call triaa in advance tell them where you're going and they would send you this thing called a trip tick they had the pre maps all lined out but from time to time things would get crossed in the miscommunications would happen and you would get to the spot that you were supped supposed to be at only to realize that something was wrong and you were not actually in the place that you were trying to get to you were not in the right place and now you're lost you got no cell phone to call anybody there's no pay phone on the corner you don't have a quarter even if you wanted to let's talk about this today what do you do when you get lost what do you do when you need directions and you're not sure where to go in life not on the road what happens in life when everything you thought you knew isn't quite what you thought it was well when the normal way to figure stuff out doesn't seem to be working anymore and Life starts falling apart or when you upgrade to the latest Google Maps app in life and it still doesn't get you where you thought you were going to go you upgraded but it didn't work out or when life has a hiccup because we all know life always has hiccups most of us can't make it a week or a day without there being a life hiccup but for some reason we still didn't see it coming the rules of life have changed and it seems like nobody's given you the new rules or when someone you've trusted for the last three years betrays you and become a great disappointment to you what do you do then what do you do when you're lost what do you do when you're wandering what do you do when you have no idea how to get out of the situation that you're in what do you do when your old Street smarts now harm you more than help you what do you do when your previous days look like they were your best days and your future days seem to be getting worse and worse at that point where do you go for directions in those moments how do you make a good decision who's the ancient Sage that you need to go talk to in that moment well we're going to be talking about this today how to make a hard decision in a complicated and broken moment let's go ahead and make sure that we understand a couple of core assumptions to inform the process before we jump back into our Acts or as we continue our acts series then we'll jump into the example from acts in Matthew chapter 6:33 the first core assumption is this verse seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well I know we're in a scripture Memory season right now and you can add this to your list of version uh verses in the Bible to memorize seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well all the stuff you need you don't got to worry about you focus on God and his kingdom and he takes care of the rest let me State this all Pursuits what does this mean all Pursuits that don't start oriented towards God and His Kingdom will ultimately lead to disappointment that's the fundamental meaning there and what is this kingdom of God and his righteousness what is that well we've been talking about it for years it's good news to the poor healing for the broken freedom for the captive Injustice for the oppressed that's what the kingdom of God looks like one of the things to pay attention here to here is that whatever is happening on this Earth whatever the currency or the the high value stuff of this Earth is in this world world is eternally irrelevant so our Focus needs to be eternally oriented towards God his kingdom his purposes that's the point now just imagine go back quite some time and you were living in the South the Deep South during the Civil War and you had accumulated large amounts of Confederate Currency and through a series of events you become convinced that the south is about to lose the war and your money is soon going to be worthless what Would You Do Well if you had any common sense you would get rid of your Confederate money and you would put your every penny you could into the currency that is about to come and prepare yourself for the end of the war now this passage in uh Matthew 6 when Jesus was talking fundamentally says that we need to be investing in the currency of Heaven the world economy is going down your wallet your venmo your 401k account is full of soon to be useless currency the currency that's encouraging huh the currency of this world will be worth nothing when you die you're probably going to die just saying or when Christ returns it's going to be worth nothing and both of those things could happen at any moment the passage helps us Orient our eles to our true north of God to assess whether or not the challenge we are facing our lost moment our wandering moment the difficult situation whatever it is we're running through or dealing with helps us to assess whether or not that challenge we're facing is even a situation that we should be involved with on any level at all the next assumption is this that wisdom is available from God to the undivided James chapter 1 says this if you need Wisdom ask our generous God and he will give it to you now a lot of people memorize this this passage and they stop memorizing right there and they don't finish out the thought they don't finish out what's really being said here in this text if you need Wisdom ask our generous God he will give it to you there's some conditions here he will not not rebuke you for asking but when you ask him be sure that your faith is in God alone do not waver for a per do not waver for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord that's a rough verse James such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord their loyal Y is divided between God and the world and they are unstable in everything they do so the Assumption here the second assumption is wisdom is available to all of us from God if we are undivided but if your loyalty is divided between this world and its trolls and its Trinkets and its toking moments then it's going to be a rough ride and you're going to find yourself misled lost and directionless that's the nature of this life so now we're jumping into the acts uh acts 1 chap 12 continuing on then the apostles this is sorry this is an account of a really difficult moment for the earliest Christians and how they navigated through a very difficult decision they had to make this is right after Jesus has ascended to Heaven this is after Jesus like just a few weeks earlier Jesus had been crucified Jesus had risen from the dead uh he had spent some time with his uh the early Christians his disciples and and those that followed and at right before this moment Jesus has ascended into heaven verse 12 then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives a distance of half a mile somebody say half a mile half a m okay when they arrived they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were staying here are the names of those that were were present Peter John James Andrew Philip Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James son of alus Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James they all met together and were constantly United in prayer along with Mary the mother of Jesus several other women and the brothers of Jesus why are they going to Jerusalem let's start there the disciples watch Jesus ascend to heaven and the first thing they do is they go to Jerusalem they're going to Jerusalem very simply this is not rocket science today friends they go to Jerusalem because Jesus told them to go to Jerusalem actually uh he told them to stay in Jerusalem this is the same place Jerusalem is the same place where just a few weeks earlier the leaders in Jerusalem had killed their leader now Jesus wants them to hang out in the same place with the same people just think about this it probably wasn't the easiest of all decisions acts 1 ver4 Jesus had told them what to do once he was eating with them he commanded themo not leave Jerusalem until the father send you the gift he promised as I told you before John baptized with water but in just a few days you will be baptized uh with the Holy Spirit notice this immediately after Jesus ascends to heaven the disciples First Act was to Simply obey the most basic of things that Jesus had said there's two parts there obey and the most basic of things Jesus had said don't leave Jerusalem until but they were not currently in Jerusalem so they hurried over to Jerusalem because they weren't there it says a half mile these little seemingly in significant things in the Bible always crack me up like the half mile distance it actually doesn't say half mile it says a Sabbath day's walk which is just less than a mile but most of us have no sense of this because most of us don't even hit 2,000 steps a day on our podometer or our Google that tracks us right so we're like we're so we don't that sounds like a long way it's not a long way but what is going on here is the Bible is filled with all kinds of idioms and cultural expressions that uh sometimes the Bible translations just translate what it means for us so that we don't stumble over it that's what's happening here basically the idea is they went they went to Jerusalem because Jesus said so because Jesus said so that's what they did it was simple it was basic it would have been easy to overlook if they had set up a committee to decide what to do on the top of that mountain When Jesus ascended they would have said let's go someplace safe where it's nice and we don't have to confront anything that's what they would have said but they didn't they just did what Jesus told them to do let's get this taken care of first you can't get complicated things sorted out in your life until you get the basic things right first so many people want to excel at the crazy stuff out there when they haven't learned to excel at the basic things first you will see in a moment that they're about to make a critical decision but in order to make critical decisions well in life we must build on one good decision and then another good decision and then another good decision you don't build a you don't build a giant house on a bad Foundation you got to have the good decision first if the first decision that you made was founded in disobedience then everything else following is going to be corrupted and at risk of collapse that is fundamentally the truth excel at the basics of obedience first complicated decisions require an honest evaluation of the foundation that that situation is based upon and basic obedience is foundational verse 15 continuing on in the story during this time when about 120 Believers were together in one place Peter stood up and addressed them brothers he said the scriptures had to be fulfilled concerning Judas who guided those who arrested Jesus this was predicted Long Ago by the Holy Spirit speaking through King David Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us leave verse 17 on the screen Judas was one of the 12 disciples and Judas is the one who betrayed Jesus and turned Jesus over to be crucified Judas was that disciple that took all the trust that he had been given and he betrayed it for silver now a lot of times Judas just becomes the enemy in the story or the bad guy but I want you to think about this for a moment what I wonder what the disciples felt about this what what do you do when somebody you trust messes up what do you do when you're authentically betrayed by someone who you deeply loved or admired a partner or a mentor or a hero think about that just for a second it must have been tough I mean do you give up and say oh Judas I guess none of this is real not real do you surrender I mean it's painful to lose a friend it's painful it also was probably pretty embarrassing that someone you thought was your ride or die was just a greedy traitor that that hit you in a different place and on top of it all Judas killed himself after the whole situation it says in verse 18 Jesus had bought a field with the money he received from his treachery falling head first there his body split open spilling out all his intestines Luke Luke wrote this I think he was still a little hot under the collar when he wrote this like he was like he wanted to like just just blow Judas up all the way just like tell you all the Gory details he was still working on some forgiveness the the news of his death spread to all people of Jerusalem and they gave the place the Aramaic name a Elma which means the field of blood get this the disciples must have been Furious hurt scared angry they had all the feelings and they were wrestling through it I would imagine that they were sad and confused as well because Judas had taken his failure into his own hands afterwards by Suicide the disciples did not even have the chance to restore him remember remember Peter the guy talking in this text had also betrayed Jesus and Jesus sought him out and restored him had Judas not taken things into his own hands it would have been the clear pattern for Jesus to restore him as well that's hard to get your head around there's a lot of reasons why it might be complicated to think about but this is the posture of Jesus is to restore those who the enemy has deceived so what do you do when someone has failed you well in this situation we see what they did they looked to the word of God verse 20 Peter continued this was written in the Book of Psalms where it says let his home become desolate with no one living in it talking about Judas It also says let someone else take his position giving them instruction on what they're supposed to do these were quotes from Psalm 69 and Psalm 109 that they had understood as Messianic prophecies meaning these were prophetic things that King David wrote Because the Holy Spirit asked him to write these songs so it would make a lot of sense that Peter would look in the places in the Old Testament or the places in their Bible to see what it is they should do because so much of what had already taken place up to this point in their experience with Jesus was that it was stated in the Bible so in this moment this Messianic song that the Holy Spirit gave to King David contains the answer on what to do next they were in a tricky situation on what to do about judas's departure and they needed Direction on what to do next so they looked to the word of God and then they did what it said watch Watch What Happens Next verse 21 this is how this plays out so now we must choose a replacement for Judas from Among The Men Who were with us the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus from the time he was baptized by John until the day he was taken from us whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus resurrection so they nominated two men Joseph called barabus also known as Justice and Mias two men then they all prayed oh Lord you know every heart show us which of these men you have chosen as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry for he has deserted us and gone where he belongs still a little angry then they call then they cast lots and Mias was selected to be an apostle with the other 11 it's very interesting here the the casting lots thing that we see there that they did is the modern equivalent of drawing straws can I tell you never in my life have I drawn straws I don't even know what that is but it's more like flipping a quarter or rolling dice just it was just something that they did to decide what to do but they didn't just make it up this was very int intentional that they cast lots this goes all the way back to the Book of Leviticus chapter 16 where you see a story in Leviticus or um the rule in Leviticus about something called the scapegoat where every year they would take two pure unblemished goats and one of them would be required to be sacrificed to make atonement for the people of Israel for the sins now this unusual Old Testament law that many people have never read Because when you read Leviticus you make it past chapter 2 and you're like I don't know about this one I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this okay so a lot of people don't actually make it all the way through so they don't get to this one but this unusual Old Testament law turns out was a setup it was a universal setup for Jesus to become our sacrificial scapegoat he becomes our scapegoat he takes away the sins of the whole world okay so it's a throwback all the way to Leviticus so once again inside the story in Acts we see the story of picking a new testament Apostle is a hint back at Jesus being in the Bible already here's the verse uh verse eight from Leviticus he is to cast sacred lots to determine which goat will be reserved as an offering to the Lord and which will carry the sins of the people to the Wilderness I way oversimplified it but if you really want to read it Leviticus 16 go ahead here we have here we have this this phrase where it says he is to cast sacred lots and so it seems like it's an odd con connection to go all the way back to Leviticus to do it but they were making these connections that Jesus was the savior of the world that there was all this sacrificial stuff there was all this scapegoat stuff happening so how does all of this help us when we need to make when we need direction or need to make an important decision this is critical here and this is we're going to pull it all together here right at the end watch closely first one is this or six things that took place in the story the first thing they did was they acknowledged the truth they didn't pretend like this didn't bother them Judas really did hurt them and Judas really did betray them that was a fact that is what occurred they acknowledged the truth second they came together in unity in purpose they came to together together do you know what our proclivity to do is when we have a really difficult moment in life difficult decision to make this is what most people do now instead of coming together we isolate going through something hard you're gonna isolate and just kind of grind it out figure it out you always figured it out before you're tough you can do it and you just isolate which is literally opposite of what we're supposed to do it is the least healthy thing to do in that moment so they came together in unity with purpose and they came together also to counsel each other right so they they they're they're all aware here they're all they're all in this together third thing was they look to the word the Bible is the final rule for life and conduct in case you didn't know that if you are struggling with something and you're not quite sure what to do and you look into the word of God and the word of God says this is the correct path and you were going down that path your path needs to change so that you do the path that the word of God says because the Bible is the final rule it's like the final Authority it's it's not just about book of General ideas it's not just like a compilation of TED talks in there this is the final Rule now sometimes you come across stuff that's hard you're like ow whoa I don't like that welcome to the club lots of things are not going to like because we are fallen and broken and wicked hearted people the Bible is bringing correction to us all other opposing IDE ideas are to be rejected fourth seek the Lord it says they prayed they prayed now in this moment you'll notice that when they prayed it wasn't a long prayer it wasn't a 17-hour prayer meeting it wasn't an all night prayer Gathering not at this point this was they were following the instructions doing what they were supposed to do they prayed they committed it to God asked for his help and then the fifth thing was they followed counsel as the worship team comes up they followed the counsel of God through his word you know they that means they obeyed right so there's obedience and there's execution there doing they didn't just hear they actually did we're following his counsel and six this is where the casting lots part comes in they entrusted the outcome to God so in this moment they realize hey both of these guys seem good to us so God here you go and they entrusted the outcome to God that's critically important as you wrestle with these decisions that you need to make and you've done all this work and finally you feel that you have your marching orders and then you just simply have to entrust it to God because at the end of the day I'm not God and you're not God Only God is God why don't you stand with me as we close I know some of you are shook that I'm not God the uh so we all have decisions to make all of us we all get in moments where we're confused or have tricky things going on sometimes it's normal everyday life stuff like do I stay or do I move do I start a this relationship or do I end a relationship do I is it time for me to slow down in Life or is it time for me to double down and go all in is it time for me to go out and look for help doesn't always have to be complicated right some some of these are just simple decisions that we're just confused about but can I tell you that in my life when I have done this well and of course I don't always do it well when I've done it well the answers are so frequently simple it's things like go or here or now or wait or not yet or never or breathe or forgive or release permit forbid prepare or build develop or we're just getting started let's go whatever it is when you find yourself lost and wandering or stuck or confused or overwhelmed if your past is a barricade for you and your future is Bleak all of these things are things we simply bring to Jesus bring to Jesus today and take those steps that we talked about let's start today let's give some of these things to Jesus today that you're you're wrestling with that you're in a moment of decision about the altars are open let's spend some time praying today", "everyone i'm christina and i'm pastor emily and i'm on staff at east coast international church and this is our holy week podcast this week we're going to be taking a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it my king shaping the rivers into worlds what grace hello everyone happy good friday guys thanks for joining us again all right so we're gonna jump right into the passages and then get into the discussion emily could you read from matthew 27 absolutely matthew 27 starting in verse one very early in the morning the leading priests and the elders of the people met again to lay plans for putting jesus to death then they bound him led him away and took him to pilate the roman governor when judas who had betrayed him realized that jesus had been condemned to die he was filled with remorse so he took the 30 pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders i have sinned he declared for i have betrayed an innocent man what do we care they retorted that's your problem then judas threw the silver coins down in the temple and went out and hanged himself the leading priests picked up the coins it wouldn't be right to put this money in the temple treasury they said since it was payment for murder after some discussion they finally decided to buy the potter's field and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners that is why the field is still called the field of blood this fulfilled the prophecy of jeremiah that says they took the 30 pieces of silver the price at which he was valued by the people of israel and purchased the potter's field as the lord directed i'm going to skip over to luke to finish reading up the passages for today and we're skipping a kind of a chunk of the story where pilate has brought jesus is brought before pilate but just moving straight into luke 23 verses 26 through 49 it says as they led jesus away a man named simon who was from cyrene happened to be coming in from the countryside the soldiers seized him and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus a large crowd trailed behind including many grief-stricken women but jesus turned and said to them daughters of jerusalem don't weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for the days are coming when they will say fortunate indeed are the women who are childless the wombs that have not borne a child and the breasts that have never nursed people will beg the mountains fall on us and plead with the hills bury us for if these things are done when the tree is green what will happen when it is dry two others both criminals were let out to be executed with him when they came to a place called the skull they nailed him to the cross and criminals were also crucified one on his right and one on his left jesus said father forgive them for they don't know what they are doing and the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice the crowd watched and the leaders scoffed he saved others they said let him save himself if he is really god's messiah the chosen one the soldiers mocked him too by offering him a drink of sour wine they called out to him if you are the king of the jews save yourself a sign was fastened above him with these words this is the king of the jews one of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed so you're the messiah are you prove it by saving yourself and us too while you're at it but the other criminal protested don't you fear god even when you've been sentenced to die we deserve to die for our crimes but this man hasn't done anything wrong then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom and jesus replied i assure you today you will be with me in paris by this time it was about noon and darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock the light from the sun was gone and suddenly the curtain in the sanctuary of the temple was torn down the middle then jesus shouted father i entrust my spirit into your hands and with those words he breathed his last when the roman officer overseeing the execution saw what had happened he worshipped god and said surely this man was innocent and when all the crowd that came to see chris the crucifixion saw what had happened they went home in deep sorrow but jesus's friends including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching so today is good friday in holy week and it's probably the second most famous day of holy week i think when you think of holy week you think of good friday and easter yeah so a lot of us kind of are really familiar with the story but just as a refresher of what goes on throughout this day we know that yesterday jesus was um he had his passover meal he was betrayed and arrested and then he went to that like sketchy trial with the sanhedrin that lasted through the hours like through the night hours it was basically an all-nighter and then so early in the morning as we see here they're already done with their sanhedrin thing they've decided to kill jesus and so they take him to the romans so that the romans can do the dirty work um and then they put him before pilate they rile up the crowd to you know ask pilate to crucify him pilate agrees kind of hesitantly and then um the whole crucifixion process begins and jesus undergoes um capital punishment under the roman regime which was he wasn't the only one to experience that but it's detailed in jesus's case in in gruesome detail um so we hear about him carrying his cross and going to the place of the skull and the two other criminals that were that were with him and kind of how was the crowd reacting and how was the how were the roman soldiers acting and what was it that jesus was doing and we know um that jesus actually from the time that his crucifixion began at 9 00 am to the time that he actually died at 3 pm it was 6 hours of him being on the cross that doesn't count him getting whipped or um carrying his cross or any of that stuff that happened early so this is a really quick process i mean they decided to kill this guy with very little deliberation um and it it really did happen just as fast as the story kind of makes it out to be it wasn't this big long drawn-out thing so then jesus dies and [Music] like the passage that we just read says a bunch of things happen the sky is dark the veil is torn the roman soldier realizes this guy really was the son of god and and then we kind of have that that last line ringing in my ears and the disciples watched from a distance and so that's where we're at with good friday um and we're going to get a little bit more into the details of what happened trying to highlight a few of the things that christina and i found particularly interesting as we were researching and going a little bit deeper but it's such a rich story there's so much here i mean so much yeah there's no way we're covering everything but it's good to reflect on it and so thanks for joining us as we reflect yeah so i want to take a look at this uh this little section with judas it's very interesting um he sort of has this turnaround moment of repentance and also like really freaking out realizing what just happened um that jesus has been condemned to die and he runs to the temple and is like like i just condemned an innocent man and the pharisees don't care and they're like that's your problem dude like you have to deal with it and so he flings the 30 pieces of silver on the floor and then runs out can i just say like when the pharisees said like what do we care that's your problem that made me so so mad like i'm ain't because like what moral bankruptcy right the like to to to be like you you were an accomplice in our basically our kind of like murder by roman rule yeah and you've just helped us with that but now we're gonna act like oh no no no that's all on you like we that's your problem i just like so wild to me how they can yeah i was reading something this morning and it had said that this like this could have been this possibly could have been a moment where judas was brought to repentance um but but the priests the people who were supposed to be there to help you be in right relationship with god were so hard and that they that they um like he was just brought to even more despair yeah and he ended up going out and hanging himself and just ending his life there um yeah it's crazy that's that's like just how satan works i think like because even if i would have imagined the pharisees would have wanted to save face and be like no judas like this is right that you would did this because this man is evil but it's like they recognize that judas sees right through all of that and that he knows this is wrong yeah and as soon as he knows it's wrong their only play and and when i say them i mean like this is how satan is right like satan's only play is to try to push you into despair away from god yeah like it's like okay well if i can't trick you anymore into thinking that you're in the right well really you're wrong well then i'm gonna push you into despair right and man and then and then like juxtaposed next to their kind of like oh it wouldn't be right for us to put these pieces of silver in the temple treasury it's like dude what what kind of like what is even directing these people and the only thing i can think is that either they were super super like they were superstitious people that kind of were like oh like anything murdery like can't be in god's but i don't know they were just acting like it wasn't a murderer and like judas we don't care that's your problem that he's innocent and you betrayed him and right there's definitely double standards there like superstition just for the sake of tradition not any moral like anything to it and and they know too like they they paid men to lie about like to give false testimonies like they know yeah and that's true it did the whole thing was just rotten yeah so like over overtly rotten yeah and so um and so they buy this field uh the potter's field and it becomes a um a cemetery for foreigners and so still with the superstition because it's like oh this is blood money so we can't use it as a cemetery for our own people it has to be for foreigners like our own people are too good for that and there's the racism yeah yeah so they're just all kinds of wrong um but but this passage is interesting because it says um it it says this fulfilled the prophecy of jeremiah that says they took the 30 pieces of silver the price at which he was valued by the people of israel and purchased the potter's field as the lord directed and so let me just take you on a little journey that i had in research this morning that is that is very interesting to me and hopefully interesting to you guys but um there's there's a little confusion here because the only place in the old testament where you can find words similar to these verses is in zechariah 11 even though they said it it fulfilled the jeremiah prophecy some people say it's because in the in the jewish text jeremiah is the first prophet um that comes it like chronologically or however you say that word um and so when they're referring to something that was in the prophetic literature they might just say like oh that's in jeremiah which refers to all of the prophecies ever because that's the order that it comes in but i did a little digging because i wasn't too satisfied with that and so i just want to share what i found um so the passage in zechariah 11 it's verses 12 to 13 and it's it's really interesting and so it's another one of these passages of judgment on israel israel's leaders um it the israelites themselves basically um there's this shepherd figure and he has a staff called favor and he has a staff called unity and he's gotten to this point where he's just so tired of the sheep he's like i don't even care what happens to you anymore and he breaks the staff called favor and he breaks the staff called unity and it's like this breaking of of covenant um between between them and he's just done with them he's angry with them and he's like i'm gonna just leave you to the the the other shepherds that will um that will take advantage of you that won't take care of you well and so both these he's both um talking about the israelites themselves and also the religious leaders and just their corruption and we can see in this passage too how that that's also a prophecy about the state of the religious leaders at the time of jesus they're just so corrupt so wrong um and so so this is where israel is at and then these random verses show up in the middle of that passage and it says i told them if you think it best give me my pay but if not keep it and this is the shepherd talking to the sheep so they paid me 30 pieces of silver and the lord said to me throw it to the potter the handsome price at which they valued me so i took the 30 pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the lord and so there's not much explanation about what this means but my understanding and the the understanding of uh some theologians that i looked at today are saying that this is a messianic uh prophecy in the midst of this passage of condemnation towards israel um and so there's also a passage in acts that talks about how judas purchased a field and then killed himself in that field but if we look at this passage in matthew judas is not the one who purchased the field it's the the high priests um and so uh this verse says so i took the 30 pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the lord and so it's like judas by default purchase the field because he threw them on the ground and then the priest picked him up and purchased the field so that's where that comes from i just thought that was interesting that's just like a nerdy a nerdy um bible geek kind of thing but it's like peter said judas bought the field zechariah said judas bought the field and then really the high priest bought the field but judas betrayed jesus and he got those 30 pieces of silver and those were his and they went towards buying the field it's it's interesting how a prophecy can find something so specific and in the future it's fulfilled and you're just like well that's crazy like like it happened it's almost like the if i'm understanding correctly it's almost like the identity of judas and the pharisees is being converged yeah in that moment as the ones who betrayed yeah jesus yes and the ones who then purchased a field with what if i'm not if i'm reading correctly zechariah is being sarcastic there where he talks about this handsome praise yes that you valued me at like like basically like this is all you think i'm worth like it's a pittance yeah i'm the good shepherd and you when you put a price on my head the price you give me or the rate as in zechariah the rate of pay that you offer me is like just ridiculous you know ridiculously low yeah but he's just kind of sarcastically being like yeah this handsome price that yeah you know that you paid me here it is you know take it yeah yeah this is what they valued him at and and in this passage he's just so done with the sheep he's like um i'm not dealing with you guys anymore um but then i looked to jeremiah because i was still curious why why they say jeremiah if and if there was anything in there and so there's these passages in jeremiah 19 where jeremiah has to go to a potter's house and buy a jar and then he smashes the jar and he declares this whole prophecy of condemnation again and he talks about how they were they were doing um i they were practicing idolatry in this field uh right outside of the potter's house and they were sacrificing children and they were worshiping there and uh just innocent lives were spent in this field and he says no longer will this field be called uh hidden valley but it will be called the the field of slaughter um and that's interesting because in [Music] um in the matthew passage it talks about how this field became known as the field of blood and the crazy part is these two fields are in the same valley they're both in hennen valley and so the field of slaughter the field of blood i just thought that was really cool very interesting might have been the same field didn't so jeremiah also bought a field he also bought a field but that was actually which i'm wondering if this ties in you see it's like layers on layers on layers right but um he bought a field which was actually a prophetic object lesson of god's redemptive plan yeah for israel because basically it's like he bought a field at a time when siege was like imminent when israel had already gone as slaves and to to um assyria right and so now judah is left that's where jeremiah is yeah and his cousin is like trying to get trying to sell his land and a lot of people are like leaving at this time like people are fleeing judah because the economy is going downhill babylon's breathing down their neck and they're in moral decline and it really seems like there's about to be trouble and so this is like it's basically like think of it as like a housing market crash like the economy is beginning to crash because everything's falling apart yeah and in the context of buying land exactly in the context of this economic crash god tells jeremiah that he's gonna have an opportunity to buy a field and that he should do it and then his cousin comes to him and is like technically like i'm supposed to ask you first but i'm trying to like sell this land right so jeremiah buys it but it's like this picture of the it it will become fruitful again exactly like one day this is gonna be worth something like you're buying it now and it's not yeah but later it will be yeah and that's the thing is with these prophecies that are so um just terrible and there is always a like a but in the future it's gonna be okay um and so zechariah uh goes on to say in 1210 um that just basically god is coming back like he was frustrated he was like i'm done with you sheep but then he comes back and it says and i will pour out on the house of david and the inhabitants of jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication they will look on me the one they had pierced and they will mourn for him as one who mourns for an only child and john uh john quotes this passage um the one they had pierced and so this is this is a messianic prophecy because john quotes it about jesus um but then it it goes on to talk about a fountain that will cleanse them from sin it goes on to and this is the same passage if you remember back where it says the the shepherd was struck the sheep scattered um and and then it talks about that just just a perv purification and how the lord comes to reign and there's living water that will flow out of jerusalem and to all of the lands and the lord will be king over the whole earth and it's just this amazing thing to read because it's there's a messianic prophecy about judas tied into there there's a messianic prophet prophecy about um jesus up on the cross there's the prophecy about the disciples being scattered and then there's the prophecy about how there will be purification and forgiveness of sins and god will rule over the entire world and it's just like all reps all wrapped up there in a few chapter chapters in zechariah and and i just love this i just love it it's amazing yeah and we've i can't believe we've spent all this time just talking about judas so far and like that's like it's like one small detail in the story of holy week but really like there's this kind of depth throughout of like just kind of interlapping and and overlaid meanings and yeah and and we're just scratching the surface i mean we're not theologians we're not you know what i mean we're not like academic scholars right biblical scholars we're just people who love the word and are reading it and using whatever free resources are out there yeah you know so i mean that's incred we should probably move on yeah we should probably move on i wanted to just mention like there's this quick passage about um how jesus while he's walking to golgotha with this the this place called the skull with his um cross it says there's a large crowd trailing behind and a lot of grief-stricken women and jesus begins prophesying to these women who are weeping and he's like you know don't wait for me but weep for yourselves and for your children and again he gives one of these prophecies about the coming um destruction of jerusalem yeah and if we remember we talked about this on palm sunday on palm sunday during his triumphal entry he's giving the same prophecy and then on monday and tuesday when he's teaching the temple again he's talking about this like the the things to come when he's prophesying about what is to come and he's he talks about the destruction and the um persecution that's gonna break out in jerusalem yeah and then he also talks about like the end times the end of the age and so it's just incredible to me that this is so like on jesus's mind so much this is now like what is this like the fourth day so far this week it's friday yeah and he's literally about to die and this is something that's on his mind on his heart something that he finds it urgent enough and important enough to talk to people about and kind of like raise the alarm and raise awareness about this um coming judgment and coming destruction and it's so interesting to me because if you look carefully you see his heart in it his heart is broken over what is going to happen to his people so even as his people are rejecting him even as his people are following these like false spiritual leaders and the you know morally bankrupt pharisees even as even as they have just like kind of participated in allowing his you know murder to take place he's mourning what's gonna happen to them he's not vengeful he's not and this is the thing like so many times people read the bible and they hear these harsh things that are being said and they think wow god is such an angry god jesus here is not an a this is not an angry guy saying huh you feel bad for me i feel bad for you it's gonna be even worse like it's not this like hateful venom that he's spitting it's this mournful grief it's this heartbroken love yeah this is this is the this is the love of a of a god of a king who is willing to care enough about his people that it disturbs him when they hurt themselves it disturbs him when they run themselves into the ground you know and he's basically saying like get ready like be aware like you know begin thinking about these things because it's not going to be this moment of just kind of like peaceful you know occupation by the romans is going to come to an end and as we know from from world history jews have not had peace for an extended period of time since the time of jesus yeah they basically i mean there was a great diaspora and in 70 a.d with all this stuff happen and um and the roman emperor went crazy and blamed everything on the jews and there's been anti-semitic sentiments throughout world history yeah you know from that time on and they and and jesus is seeing all of that he's seeing all of that and he's mourning it yeah and he's like preparing them for it i just think that's fascinating that that's on his mind and on his heart yeah on a good friday oh i i think like jesus says um weep for yourselves don't we for me and like you you were saying that shows his concern for them um but i think ultimately man will destroy itself there will be wars and um the romans were about to take over in a few a few decades and um and he was also telling all of those end times scary things but he said to spread the gospel of the kingdom and gospel means good news and so it's like jesus is like you guys are gonna go through some stuff and it's gonna be hard and even like like mourn about it like he's not like you know like suck it up and like power through he's like like it's gonna be scary and and i'm scared for you guys and like yeah like weep about it you know but but in the midst of all of it spread the gospel of the kingdom and so it all points to that day when he will ride in in peace and he will rule over the whole world and that's that's what we look forward to we look forward to the kingdom yeah and that's why today is good friday yeah like today's today's the day that humanity murdered god yeah but god's people call it good friday right like and it's because it's just because of this insane unthinkable and yet beautiful way that god turns things upside down yeah um you were talking about the bone the bones yeah it kind of plays into this right yeah yeah so um so in john 19 when it talks about jesus dying it says these things happen so that the scripture would be filled not one of his fulfilled not one of his bones will be broken and so this is a reference to exodus 12 46 which if you guys remember uh when we were talking about the feast of an unleavened bread i read from some passages in exodus 12 that we're giving like regulations for a passover meal and what you're supposed to do and the lamb's bones are not supposed to be broken um and so i i can just see like for for hundreds of years they're not breaking the lamb's bones and they're kind of just like i don't know why we're doing this but like yeah this is religious tradition so we're not gonna break the bones and then like you see to fulfill the prophecy and it's like oh jesus's bones were not to be broken yeah and just a side note why does it matter that his bones were not broken um so when you when people are crucified they they can sort of hang on to life longer by lifting themselves up and to breathe um because they can't breathe when they just allow themselves that's actually how you die right on a cross is by asphyxiation yeah typically wait what does this fixation sorry i can't say it's it's um what a thing to laugh about um asphyxiation is when your airway is blocked and you aren't able to breathe oh yeah yeah so so typically that that's what would happen um but if you remember they're trying to kill jesus before sabbath they're kind of in a rush they can't bury his body on sabbath right um and also there is a passage in the bible in deuteronomy 21 that talks about someone who is put to death on a on a pole or like a plank or a tree needs to be buried that day because they're cursed and basically you need to get rid of the body as soon as possible um so this this is this is like a bad death in terms of like if you are a person who is crucified you are like a defiled person you're yeah very low i mean they would leave people on the cross and they would take people like two days like people would be up there like for a long time and so to speed it up which is what i think you were getting today yeah break their bones yes to speed it up they they'd break their bones so that you know they couldn't breathe anymore and the crazy thing is that jesus died really fast really quickly which only took him six hours which was like which was crazy and the thing that that i found really interesting is that just before jesus dies he says uh father into your hands i command my spirit and he's quoting psalms 31 5 and then he breathes his last death and so it's like jesus had control of the moment that he died like he he said the thing and then he breathed his last breath and so it's like very evident that this is not satan having a victory over jesus right satan is not in control here in any way god is in control the whole way and um in that psalm let me just turn to it real quick psalm 35 uh there's also a verse that says um where is it what is it sorry psalm 31 verse 5 yeah so it says into your hands i commit my spirit deliver me lord my faithful god and then verse 8 says you have not given me into the hands of the enemy and so it's like it's like he's not in satan's hands he's not in the enemy's hands his death like the death of god what like he put his spirit into the hands of god he's in control he's doing this for a purpose yeah and satan i don't know what satan is thinking right now but he's probably not rejoicing like he probably under i think that he probably understands the implications of like this is exactly the opposite of any kind of victory over god this is god's victory in the sense that his plan is becoming accessible to everybody on such a crazy level to the entire world and this is like so many prophecies are being fulfilled right now this is the lamb giving the ultimate sacrifice um to bring so many people in communion with god and it's just amazing to me yeah i am man i think that's so incredible i i it reminds me of the passage um that says that uh no weapon formed against me will prosper yeah and i remember you know that gospel song that says the weapon may be formed but it won't prosper i remember like when i listened to that song that was the first time i ever realized like oh yeah like that's not just like a straight like victorious statement it's kind of like a statement in the midst of you're literally being like attacked like people people are sharpening knives to get at you in this in this story and and somebody's somebody is is molding and shaping and designing a weapon that is designed perfectly to get at you yeah but god's gonna block it yeah and to me that's like that's like what i see on the cross in so many ways and it's like this idea of like everything converged in this perfect way to destroy jesus yeah but it didn't prosper it didn't destroy jesus jesus instead destroyed death and sin it's crazy to me like um yeah and that's what's good that's what's so good about good friday and that is that is what we're called to i wanted to just share a few thoughts um i don't want to go too long here but i wanted to share a few thoughts about you know the divine implications and the human implications of what's happening in jesus's death and so jesus i mean jesus if if you know your doctrine you know jesus is 100 god and one 100 human and that's like a mystery that is not it's a paradox is what it is it's not like something that we can mathematically like calculate in our heads it's very difficult to wrap your mind around but it's this idea that jesus is god and man at the same time fully god and fully human um and so as god jesus was doing something with cosmic implications here i really like oh man sorry just to back up i was i was listening to about the whole bones being broken and how the passover lamb's bones weren't broken yeah i was listening to a commentator who talked about how jesus planned to kind of push forward the tensions of the moment so that he would die he timed it so he would die on passover which like he died the day after the passover meal which was technically still within that same 24-hour frame yeah and and also passover sometimes people interchangeably use that for the festival of unleavened bread which is a week-long thing anyway so he died during passover yeah but um he timed it yeah like he timed it and just thinking about that like he's he is telling them like guys i'm the lamb i'm the lamb i'm the lamb that you put my blood over your house and you're rescued from death from certain death like which how could we even understand what it means to be rescued from death like when they were being rescued from death it was like well some people died and other people didn't die you know but like us being rescued from death we're rescued from death by being able to go through death and still live it's like an ultimate rescue from death it's not just like like you won't die now but you'll die later like it's like it's like no you're never gonna die like yeah it's like you're gonna die but it just it's not gonna take like it's just gonna like roll off you like water off a duck's back you know you're just gonna like um but yeah anyway so he was doing something in this moment he was conquering death in a way that obviously none of us could could do because all the time i think like people must wonder like why does it matter that jesus died millions and billions of people have died why does it matter that jesus was crucified so many people have been crucified crucified like specifically crucified it's not even like there's something and then also you think about like the torture the humility all of the things that jesus experienced other people have experienced right why does it matter that he did what makes him different and this is what makes him different is that he was god it's his divinity that makes it so different isaiah 53 which is just part of this huge passage that says all these incredible things but isaiah through the inspiration of the spirit of god prophesied about jesus when he said he was despised and rejected a man of sorrows acquainted with deepest grief we turned our backs on him and looked the other way he was despising we did not care yet it was our weakness he carried it was our sorrows that weighed him down and we thought his troubles were a punishment from god a punishment for his own sins but he was pierced for our rebellion crushed for our sins he was beaten so we could be whole he was whipped so we could be healed all of us like sheep have strayed away we have left god's path to follow our own yet the lord laid on him the sins of us all so that to me is like this perfect picture of what was happening divinely on the cross something that no human could do only god could gather together all of the filth and all of the ra and all of the curse and all the pain and all the sorrow of humanity and take it with him into death and that's what jesus did and like so there's there's the divine implications but then there's the human implications and the human implications really speak to me because i'm a human right i'm not god but i am human and jesus was human and as a human he tells us that he set an example for us which is pretty intense if you think about it jesus was being obedient to god showing restraint when he could have asked angels he could have commanded angels to deliver him and instead he showed restraint and he succumbed to all that was happening around him he was humble his character shows through like he's on the cross making arrangements for his mother he's on the cross going through one of the most physically grueling experiences that a person could have passed through i would imagine and he's in prayer yeah concerned about his relationship with god yeah father why have you forsaken me got into your hands i commend my spirit like the character of jesus have you ever heard that like you know like if you cut them they bleed like loyalty like if you cut me i'll bleed like love if you cut me up like it's it's not character jesus's character wasn't just like a human behavior that he tried very hard to act with yeah but it like went to his very core yeah it inundated every it was in and through all that he was his humility his love for others his forgiveness and willing like he's he's god forgive the roman soldiers they don't know what they're doing he's he's praying for people around him he's he's the women are weeping for him as he's going to the cross and he's saying guys like i know it's bad what's happening to me but worry about what's going to happen to you like think about what's coming you know he's like he's in these moments of desperation he's not only desperately undergoing this trial but he is he is trying so hard to take advantage of his last moments on the earth to be able to give to others and say the things that need to be said and care for others and you just see that like character come through so strong if i could real quick that just reminds me of one of my favorite verses it's hebrews 4 15 it says for we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weakness but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet he did not sin and so it it's right like his character shows through but he he's been here like he knows what it's like to be human he knows his struggle yep and he empathizes he's compassionate with it which is so amazing right because on the one hand jesus says like john 12 which is the passage i was going to read here jesus says um now the time has come for the son of man to enter his glory i tell you the truth unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies it remains alone but its death will produce many new kernels a plentiful harvest of new lives he's talking about his death and and how it's worth it because it's going to produce something good even though it's horrible and then he says those who that he turns it on us he's like this i'm there's what's about to happen to me but then he turns it on us and he says those who love their life in this world will lose it those who care nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity anyone who wants to serve me must follow me because my servants must be where i am and the father will honor anyone who serves me and so like on the one hand he's saying follow me take up your cross you know use my example as the model for your life yeah don't think of me as like oh only god could do that and we'll never be like jesus no try to be like me yeah you're my servants you come come with come with me on this journey and then at the same time in hebrews we hear that he's sympathetic he's empathetic that he cares his compassion is there he knows what it's like to be tempted he knows what it's like to be weak he knows that we fall short and he looks on us with love and that's the heart of god throughout all of scripture throughout all of scripture it's that hard like i don't know to me it's amazing to me it's amazing how desperate god is to rescue humanity yeah that he would place that kind of value on us that he would love us that way you know it's like he's looking for", " he's looking for us to reach out in any small way you know yeah and that's why when i was reading about the the man on the cross next to him the criminal i began to cry because it's just so like this guy had so little to give jesus like it's it almost is like pitiful he he tells his other you know fellow criminal don't you fear god you know don't you respect god even as you're dying like this guy didn't do anything wrong and and then he's like you know jesus remember me and parrot like and it's it's almost like i hate to say it but it's it's very small what that man did yeah you know but jesus was like it was like jesus was so glad to respond by saying like this very day you'll be with me you know like it was like it's like you take a step towards god and he floods and envelops you with love and and it's like he's just he's so close to us and he's waiting so desperately for us to just say yes and to just go with him and to just let him love us and let him be our our lord and our king and the one who's in charge and um yeah and the way the way to follow him may be difficult but he he's made the way like he's gone before he's done it all yeah himself and we don't do it alone we do it with him and through him and by him and like it's it's through what he's done that we are able to follow him and it's not an easy thing to follow him right but it's because of him and it's for him and yeah and man he's worth it yeah yeah yeah in him in him through him and by him right yeah it was in him we live and have our being yeah yeah he's the way to life yeah and i'm so glad today that he is still with us maybe not in the same way he was when he was walking with the disciples but his spirit is here and jesus we just thank you why don't you join me in prayer as we close jesus we thank you for being with us today we thank you god for defining what good is and and teaching us that good is not just ease and comfort in this world that good is not just a super fat a superficial happy thing but that even in the darkest of circumstances even in the most difficult of times even in the most trying moments that you can make things good because you're you're the master of recycling you're the you're the the king of redemption you're the greatest artist that ever was god make a mosaic out of our lives god take the broken pieces and make us whole in a new and beautiful way infused with your spirit and infused with your grace and mercy god god i pray today as we as we think of all that you've done for us on that cross god give us deeper revelation and draw us deeper into love for you father god we we love you so much we love you so much jesus help us to love you more help us to love like you love us we pray these things in jesus name amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] we still [Music] returns [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you [Applause] [Music] god",

As a Church we do not currently support \"Political Organizations\u201d. \n\n  * _2_. There are 2 black lives matter scenarios happening in America right now. \n\n  * _3_. The black lives matter political organization that has a web page and set of beliefs. It has a political agenda and is not something we are speaking to.  \n\n  * _4_. The Black lives matter movement \"generically\" is what we are speaking to as a church. \n\n  * _5_. My sermon on Sunday was primarily advocating for the church to mirror the kingdom that Jesus inaugurated (which highlights oppressed people groups and for the non black folks amongst us to listen without defense to the Persons of color in their life that push back on our current understandings), the obvious application for 2020 Christians in America is working to bring freedom to oppressed peoples which would start with Black people. Then progressing to others oppressed peoples and people groups (native Americans, latinos, those that struggle with mental health issues, substance abuse issues, etc...........). \n\n  * _6_. Biblical Justice (setting captives free) is challenging in that it carries the spiritual freedom of New Life in Christ and setting captives free by tearing down spiritual strongholds in systems and structures that most of us normally hold in high regard.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  * Rules have not changed for churches in Phase 2\n\n    * Church stays as is\n\n    * 1 on 1 Meetings ok now\n\n    * Now its time for us to start bringing bodies back into the building (Leaders, Volunteers, etc\u2026)\n\n    * Small groups start in a few weeks.\n\n      * Groups of ten are outside\n\n      * Any group in the building requires masks\n\n      * No kids in the building\n\n      * Church rule says no childcare until further notice\n\n      * Active group in the building is a NO\n\n      * All outside groups don't require masks\n\n    * Ana B.

an agreement on the details and now there's just a few legal things once it's locked in we'll be able to talk more about it but please continue to pray about that situation it's going to help us with quite a few things moving forward over the past 22 years the common theme of what takes place on Sundays at East Coast International Church is this taking a look at what the Bible has to say for 22 years 52 Sundays a year that's what we're looking at what does the Bible have to say the reason we do that is because the Bible is one of the main ways that God Reveals His character the Bible gives instructions for daily life if you are confused about what to do the Bible can help with that the Bible reveals God's will it reveals God's will what we should be doing God the Bible reveals God's love as well so when we gather together we highlight the Bible so that we can experience God's love and character discover God's will find next steps for our life and allow our minds to be continually transformed by the renewing of our mind through God's word so these are not things that can only be done on Sunday we can also do these during the week you could in private as you engage with the Bible or Bible study groups or small groups that are studying the Bible these are all ways that you can engage with the Bible and experience these things plus many more we are in a year of Bible engagement and so each month we're giving you different uh portions of the Bible to go ahead and engage with very closely a couple weeks ago we talked about Ephesians Philippians Colossians those are the three books or three letters that we're encouraging you to read this month now listen if I'm being really honest if you wanted to speed read those you could be done in a few minutes all right it's not that long it's not that long but I'm encouraging you to slow read I want it to take you 30 days to get through them all right it's okay slow read it like we just put a passage of scripture up on the screen a minute ago that was slow reading really slow now usually you don't have background music when you're reading like that but but just slow read it it's fine So today we're talking about Philippians Philippians was a letter written to a group of Christians in Philippi that's the name of the the city and Philippi would be located in modern day Greece today in case you're curious where it's at Philippians has some of the best some of the most popular verses that people quote or to say a lot in the Christian World things like I am certain that God who began a good work within you will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns that's an inspiring passage it means God's not going to give up on you you're kind of messed up but God's gonna work it out all right that's a great verse uh or another one for me to live is Christ and to die is gain that's a good one don't worry about anything instead pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done these are good stuff all in Philippians a little tiny letter and now dear brothers and sisters one final thing fix your thoughts what is true honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise if your mind gets out of control sometimes go to Philippians 4 8 and those are the things you should be thinking about for I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength that's a good one right there right it's not really talking about running a marathon but it's all right you can say it anyhow okay it's like when everything's going bad you can deal with it because Christ is there with you let's do some good stuff good stuff on Philippians little tiny letter and lots of good good things a ton more so Paul who wrote this letter he was an apostle or one of the early church leaders and Pastor to so many of these churches that he started he was out all over the place all over the world and he writes this letter to this church in Philippi it's actually possibly three different letters they've just kind of squashed together but he wrote this letter from a prison in Rome sounds familiar because it's the same prison he wrote to the church in Ephesus from okay the book of Ephesians he wrote from Roman about the year 61. we know from Acts chapter 16 another part of the Bible that Paul had gone to the city of Philippi and had preached the good news of Jesus and it helped establish the church in the city of Philippi around 50 or 51. this is not last week this is a couple thousand years ago okay a long time ago this specific church was unique amongst all the other churches that Paul had started this church was unique because it had a strong missionary zeal it was consistently supporting Paul and Paul had a close friendship with this church this is the same church where the wealthy Merchant Lydia somebody said Lydia she's a very important uh but understated figure in the Bible but this Merchant Lydia she began she was a merchant and sold a cloth and she began to follow Jesus she was wealthy and this is where Paul and Silas were also thrown into prison because they had cast a demon out of a woman and broke the income stream that she produced she was producing an in-cream income stream from her demonic possession and was doing some Witchcraft and fortune telling which is all bad by the way stay away if that's been part of your life you need to renounce it like a little free that's free for you today that's a little free I just want to stay there but I can't okay and so they get thrown into prison because they mess up the act the the broken economic system of the city you can mess with the city all day long until you mess with their economic system that's broken a whole bunch of Christians decided we're not content with the government selling drugs and government sanctioned gambling all over our phones you're oh got quiet what I am going to stay here for a second I'm going to stay right here delete the gambling apps from your phone if you're working on a weed store quit all right stop selling drugs to people this is all not helpful okay it's part of a broken economic system that we live in if we pushed back on that we're going to also get some pushback on that gonna get a lot of pushback but I might be in jail that's how much pushback we would get on it okay anyhow this is the prison they get put to Paul and Silas they're planting this church they they get in trouble for casting this demon out messing up the economic system they get put in prison in Philippi and I start singing they're all beat up bruised from from all the imprisonment and they start singing praising God an earthquake comes and sets them all free the chains literally fall off of their hands and ankles and the door pops open and they walk on out this is a whole different kind of stuff going on right here Philippa had a lot of crazy things going on and it was one of the spots that was Paul was really fond of and although he was traveling the whole world a lot of the world starting uh churches and preaching the Good News he was particularly fond of Philippi so he wrote a letter to one of his favorite churches from prison and this is the book of Philippians or the letter of Philippians that we're reading so that's that's what you're reading so towards the end of Philippians chapter four there's a lengthy passage where he's talking and you can feel the intimacy of this letter if you're if you're paying close attention in verse 10 it starts how I praise the Lord that you are always concerned about me again that you are concerned about me again I know you have always been concerned for me but you didn't have the chance to help me not that I was ever in Need for I have learned how to be content with whatever I have I know how to live on almost nothing our with everything I have learned the secret of living in every situation whether it is on a full stomach or empty with plenty or little for I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength see it wasn't about a marathon it was about starving all right even so you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty as you know you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the good news and then traveled on from Macedonia no other Church did this even when I was in thessalonica you sent help more than once I don't say this because I want a gift from you rather I want you to receive a reward for your kindness at that moment at the moment I have all I needed more I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me with epaphroditus they are sweet smelling sacrifices acceptable and pleasing to God verse 19. and we're going to land on first 19 this morning and this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus same God supplying for Paul supply for you okay that's the idea today we're just going to spend a little bit of time on this idea of something called Supernatural provision somebody say Supernatural okay it's not natural It's Supernatural meaning it comes from God Supernatural provision is the act of God fighting and being Victorious on your behalf in different situations so you're going to track with me throughout the rest of this service I hope and try to make this your journey this is something that you're gonna do this is something that you're gonna Implement in your own life and so verse 19 again and the same God who will take who takes care of me will somebody say will definitely he's gonna will supply all your needs my God will supply all your needs think about your needs what are your needs Harley-Davidson is not and you didn't let me finish it's not a need right it's not a need I assure you it's not a need all right but we all have needs we have physical needs we have social needs we have mental needs we have financial needs we have lots of needs some of them are not always needs or really wants but then we identify the things that are actually needs we all have needs and here we see God wants to provide for all of your needs God is our provider and will provide that's what that's what Paul said he will there's an assurance here that's really important to pay attention to of an assurance if God is your Shepherd and you are the Sheep of his pastor he promises to take care of us he will not abandon you he does not look at his flock right here at 61 Monroe Street and say you guys got way too many issues there are so many needs in this church I just got to keep on moving by to keep my reputation he sees the needs that we have in this church he sees the needs that you have as an individual and he sees it as an opportunity to show off when you enter into a relationship with Jesus you become his sheep you join his family he is your Shepherd you are irrevocably now part of his family so if you are struggling and walking around wandering around with no faith or no sense that God is willing or able to provide remember this as the irrevocable child of God there are certain things that you can expect from God as the irrevocable child of God you can expect it let me give you some things you can expect from God you're going to love this first thing you can absolutely assuredly expect will happen is God will discipline you no amens no one amen then one Hallelujah the uh all the discipline going to Julie today yeah so but listen we really should be very pleased with the idea that God discipled us because God's discipline is kind and merciful fact that's how you know it's God another thing you can expect is to be loved by God another thing you can expect is the irrevocable child of God is to be instructed by God and as we just read from Paul you can expect to experience provision in your obedience the provision of God you can expect to experience Supernatural provision now if of those four things the only thing you heard was Supernatural provision rehearse all four all right rehearsal for if you live with an expectation of provision the expectation helps you to find it when it arrives every once in a while my parents will send me like a surprise package I have there's this great little candy store in my hometown of like negative six people where I live and lived growing up and the uh there's a great little candy store and every once in a while they'll send a pound or when they're being ridiculous like two pounds of candy two pounds of like homemade chocolate with oh it's amazing okay and they'll send it but at my house there are two porches a front porch and a side porch and sometimes my parents don't tell me the package is coming in the UPS or the FedEx guy sometimes he delivers the package of the front door and sometimes he delivers it to the side door but I only use the front door so I don't see the packages when they're on the side door sometimes I'll stumble out to the side door and find a package of candy it's been there for two or three or four days I was not expecting it even though it was there for me and so I didn't know it was there because I wasn't expecting it but if I were expecting it I would look for it and I would know if that wasn't on the front porch I better go get it before somebody takes it off the side porch okay because I expect it I can find it it's so much easier to find God's provision when you expect it to be there so just think about that in the book of Exodus chapter 12 particularly the Israelites were finally delivered out in Exodus the they were delivered out the hand of the Egyptians they had been slaves for several hundred years they were enslaved and now they're coming out of of this slavery now I've a few years ago we took about you know I don't know three years to go through the book of Exodus I mean we went through we went through it which and the reason is so I could do this one point in this sermon today okay so here we go they came to a sea that they could not cross or get around they're on their way out they've escaped slavery but the enemy still wanted them back the enemy was chasing them the enemy was about to overtake them and now they're just at the Seas Edge they could see the dust of the army coming after them they could feel the presence of the enemy coming I could imagine that they could just feel horse beats like that kind of from the distance there's a giant army coming the enemy you might say it was close enough that when the wind blew their Direction they could smell the stink of the enemy that was trying to pull them back into captivity things were looking rough but God was making a new covenant with them and here's what it was if they would be his children he would be their provider he would be their provider and God would make a way even when there doesn't seem like any way is possible God would make the way so here's the point start looking for the way that God makes so that you don't miss his provision for you it's not going to be the way that you make it's going to be the way that God makes just think about it for a minute they're at the edge of the sea they're in real trouble they get a committee together real quick to decide what their options are and what their choices are they're trying to figure out how to make their way this is definitely happening they go they're like okay I got I could do this I can do this we can do this we can we can try to and they're coming up with all the ideas are so obviously flawed they know there is no hope but I can tell you what way wasn't in there part the sea and walk through it that way wasn't in the conversation because that wasn't a possible way that because that that they were trying they were coming up with natural solutions it took a supernatural provision a supernatural solution to meet their need [Music] Exodus 14 then Moses raised his hand over the sea and the Lord opened a path through the water with a strong East wind the wind blew all that night turning the seabed into dry land so the people of Israel walk through the middle of the sea on dry ground with walls of water on each side it wasn't Moses that made the way it wasn't a really Advanced DPW crew that came and emptied the sea all right it was God that provided the way out [Music] [Applause] the people did not provide the way out God provided the way out and when you experience Supernatural provision it is God that makes the way and we need to give God thanks for those moments and those seasons of Supernatural provision for some of you it's a miracle it's a miracle of God that you aren't just like the curse that was on your family of origin for some of you it is God that you didn't get gunned down and that you could even be living here today for some of you it is God that got you out of some of the things that you got yourself into the Seas blocked the Israelites but God removed the sea there might be some insurmountable things blocking you and some obstacles in your way that you can't do anything about when the spirit of God is in your life you need to start looking for the way that God makes so that you and I so that we don't miss it you got you just gotta know Moses holds the thing up people start walking in people experience freedom and victory they're going through you know you know that there's a couple Karen standing on the shore I I don't know about this you know there's a couple of people I know it's not in the text I know it's not in there but you know that somebody was just second guessing if this was really God look for the way that God makes and take it First Corinthians 10 when you are tempted he will show you a way out so that you can endure somebody say show he will show you a way out it doesn't say he will make you take it says he will show you a way out I only have to talk about somebody else you all know that there are times when God has shown you a way out and you didn't take it I've watched so many people miss their Supernatural provision because they were too busy complaining and not busy enough looking God's showing them and they're not taking it literally the oceans of the sea is parted like what's God going to do for me just take the path or they're looking for natural provision instead of Supernatural provision and that makes a lot of sense to me as a human because I'm familiar with natural things and so natural things are are most familiar but Supernatural provision seldom looks like natural provision when when people hear about supernatural provision they get really excited like they go this is very exciting God's going to provide for me a check is coming in the mail you know yeah everybody's so excited you know why you know why people get excited about the check in the mail because it doesn't take any work it's lazy provision you ever seen God do stuff that makes us be lazy in the Bible you got to reject the lazy provision Supernatural provision is part of God's character and faith-building process in our life Supernatural provision is part God's showing off in part us stepping out in faith and walking through the middle of the sea you actually got to get up and walk you gotta stroll on through I mean you could take some Instagram pictures in there it's fine but you still got to walk through God gives the Harvest but you got to go collect the corn God's provision comes with a little bit of work sometimes it comes with a lot of work because he's got a lot of provision we should look for the provision of God when we hear the plan of God and we obey the will of God when you do that you need to start looking start looking verse 19 said in the same God who takes care of me Will and Supply some might say Supply will supply all your needs from his Rich glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus when the Israelites were in the desert God sent a ridiculous amount of quail like flying chickens right so there's fly you know the quails so that the people can eat meat you know they were hungry so he sent he sent him some meat and each day God would provide for them through something called manna this is like a bread from heaven you know we're going to get to taste that someday Jesus when he was praying said give us today the food we need he's making a connection back to this time when God actually provided food daily supernaturally because it's this Jesus is clarifying that God chooses for his children to take upon himself the responsibility to make sure that we have our needs met in Mark 6 Jesus does something else he feeds at least 5 000 people there's thousands of people on the side of a hill 5 000 Plus they're hungry they've been hanging out with Jesus for a long time they didn't bring enough food they're hungry now Jesus is concerned for them and so he says hey let's he says to his guys his fellows his disciples he says hey let's feed these people what do we got they got two fish and five loaves of bread and you know what Jesus does with two loaves I mean two fish and five loaves of bread he decides to show off a little bit he supplies all their needs this is one of the craziest miracles in the Bible to me like for real how do you take I can't get my head around it two fish Five Loaves feed thousands of people yeah people try to explain this all the time and and they try to explain it in ways that that sound so righteous like this one you know what really happened was that the words of Jesus spoke to the hearts of the men and women and they were generous with the remainder of the food that they had and they shared it with everybody around them that sounds nice right but that's not what the text says it's not what it says at all it says that Jesus showed off it took two fish Five Loaves multiplied it and had enough for everybody with leftovers what is he doing he's setting the tone just like God did in Exodus he's setting the tone my followers who are my children I will provide for your needs I will supply your needs the word Supply seems simple to us but the word here really means to cram like cramming a net full of fish it's spilling all the way up or cramming something so full that it's pouring out over when we are experiencing true Supernatural provision he will supply or cram full to overflowing all of your needs remember it's not like God's like oh I'm afraid I'm going to run out I can only give you a little everything is his Psalm 30 says this weeping may last through the night but joy comes with the morning enemy of your soul and life wants you to go to sleep weeping and to keep you asleep so that you won't get the miracle that God has for you so when God says wake up o sleeper it's because he's got joy for you in the morning because Joy comes in the morning to the child of God that walks it obedient the Apostle Paul Pastor Paul tells us God will supply all your needs from his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus now again if somehow you have accidentally heard me say that this means you get three extra Harley-Davidsons this year you have misunderstood this sermon so far next one is align yourself align yourself line yourself up for Supernatural provision how do you do that you join God's family you obey God we can mess up God's provision by being disobedient and stingy you know we can mess that whole thing up so obey God then trust God you can also mess up God's provision by taking it into your own hands like we're all called to work right like we in February we talked about financial ethics in the kingdom and one of those core principles is work like working and eating go together well without the other it's not supposed to happen so we're called to work but we're called to work at proper times and in proper ways there's actually a time to proper not work properly yeah there is there's a way to work in a way that's not ethical yes there is so don't sell your ethics and don't sell your soul think about it how much value how much is your soul worth and if you want to know how much you value your soul it's based on what you're willing to trade for your spiritual health I know my spiritual health is worth this but hey I'm going to do this other thing instead so 26 an hour is my spiritual health worth or whatever it happens to be how much value do you place on the call God has placed on your life how much value do you place on it see God is responsible for the providing for the provision we're responsible to be obedient and to follow so worship team comes back up we're responsible to be good stewards of what it is that God gives us if God gives you something be a good Steward with it if God calls you to work and restore people in broken places then you will never be content serving in any other context and so you must recognize that God's provision will come in different ways than traditional it will literally be Supernatural provision in other words you must go so God can show you go and God will show look for God's provision become a provider you see God's good stewards of what God does give you means this it means that you don't hoard it you don't hoard God's provision you don't just build a bigger silo you build a bigger opportunity to bless real practical example is ever since our church started owning different properties something near 20 different churches have shared our worship spaces in case you don't know that we have lots of different churches that share our worship spaces and in each case we have saved those other churches tens of thousands of dollars a year and we do that because God has provided for us so that we can help provide for them and now we don't just do that corporately we should do that also individually there's a maturity that occurs in your life when you begin Walking with God and you eventually begin to not just be the recipient of Supernatural provision from God you begin to become part of a miracle for other people you've got to be part of the miracle journey and the Miracle story when you read the stories of Jesus encountering broken people or people that are in desperate need and he goes and he rescues them they're great stories and you can resonate with this idea that God has rescued me you can resonate with God has rescued me and I'm so grateful but seldom do we put ourself in the character of Jesus in the story we don't like just move Jesus out put ourselves in for the story because it seems complicated to do that but then when you read in other parts of the Bible where Christians early Christians did the same stuff that Jesus did well I got to tell you the truth I put myself in that story I put myself as as the Apostle I put myself in as the Christian that's going around healing people and delivering people and setting people free I'm like that's who I want to be hahaha when whenever you watch those fun movies those rescue movies no big ocean scene and there's boats tipped over somebody's holding on for dear life in a in a rescue helicopter comes in and somebody shimmies down the Rope pulls somebody out of the water and saves their life I get inspired watching those movies but I don't ever walk away thinking so inspired I love being the victim I think I want to be the guy that comes down and grabs somebody out of the water right because it's because something within us recognizes it that we're supposed to be partnering with God to bring provision and rescue to other people in other words that means I don't dread helping I don't regret helping I get excited that I get to be part of something awesome that I get to whatever happens to me and whether it's my time or my talents or my money I get to be part of it so here's some things for you as we close expect a miracle look for God's provision align yourself with God's purposes so that God can unleash Supernatural provision on you and others around you all right buddy we stand as we close today [Music] today there are needs that are represented here there are situations that you are encountering that you are facing and you may right now be able to identify that you are standing in front of a sea and you cannot come up with a natural way around it [Music] God to step in you need God to intervene you need to recognize who you are in Christ you are here his irrevocable child [Music] he is yours and you are his and you can invite God into this moment can invite God into this moment you can ask God to meet your needs today as the worship team closes I would encourage you do exactly that today don't be afraid and do not be ashamed invite God to meet your needs [Music]",

home i'm really excited to welcome all of you to our week of prayer and fasting and to go ahead and grab your coffee your water whatever you're doing uh make sure that you make some space to hear from god this week today i just want to open this up with a word of prayer and before we do that i just want to remind you that uh we are praying with you and we want to know what you're praying about whatever's on your heart we want to be praying alongside of you and if you're kind of looking for a spiritual path for this week as you're praying i really want to highlight for you hebrews 10 23 if you have your bible app if you have a paper bible you can highlight this verse as well hebrews 10 23. we're going to be coming back to this verse again and again it's is what it says let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm for god can be trusted to keep his promise i'm going to read that one more time let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm for god can be trusted to keep his promise that's a good verse and what i love about this verse is that it highlights the character of god so many times we can get caught up in what we lack and what we're trying to achieve that we miss out on this key idea that at the core of prayer and at the core of our lives it's really all about god it's about his promises it's about who he is and we really are trying to take the focus off of ourselves and off of our you know insecurities our shortcomings and we're just trying to say god we believe you whatever you say we know that you cannot lie we know that your word is true and we're going to hold on to those promises even when the going gets tough even when we're going through hardships through doubts through seasons of insecurity through seasons of pain whatever it is we're not going to let anything hold us back anymore and we're just going to trust you and we're going to make room for you so if you're just joining us for the first time if you're new to this listen there's no way you could possibly mess it up other than to just not do it but if if your heart is willing it's really simple it's whatever floats your boat what i mean by that is you simply want to make room for god and if you're a person that likes to just sit and quiet and contemplate go ahead and do that if you like to kick on a playlist and you know just pace around the room and pray if you like to pray out loud if you like to journal and do it quietly if you like to jog with jesus if you want to have coffee with jesus if you want to go into the woods and speak to him god understands and he knows our hearts and so you don't have to worry about doing it wrong if you're willing you can't do it wrong if you're at the grocery store listen the holy spirit will find you wherever you are so don't worry and just pray along and see what god would do and just open yourself up and say god whatever you want to do this week i'm here i'll meet with you will you meet with me and i guarantee you god will show up because he's promised to do that he said come close to me and i'll come close to you and that is his promise so i can't wait to get started this entire week again i'm releasing a new prayer podcast each and every day so join me right now i just want to end in prayer you can join me as well as we hand this time over to god god we want to thank you for this prayer and fasting week god we need you we need you in our lives and we're asking you to come and meet us in this time of prayer whatever we're going through whatever circumstances surround us god we set that aside now to say that we need you and we believe you god and if there's anything in us that is struggling help us in our own belief because it's about you god you said to abraham i am el shaddai i am god almighty and we believe that we believe that you are powerful you're the god who makes a way where there is no way you're the god who removes stones and god we believe that you're a living god thank you for being such a generous god and it's in jesus name we pray amen thank you so much for joining me today we'll see you again tomorrow bye", "\n\n**09.22.2020**\n\n**General Notes

there may not have been as many prayers happening across the globe since world war ii this is a very difficult time and i would like you to join me as we pray for ukraine and the people of ukraine right now would you join me together heavenly father today we join with christians from around the globe today and the christians of ukraine and those that are simply calling out to you today asking for your help or ask for your not just comfort and guidance for the people of ukraine but we asked for their protection we ask that they would have their needs met that you would supply everything that they need we ask for safety upon their lives from an enemy that is unjustly coming after them today we pray specifically that missiles that are being launched by russia would fail the tanks would get stuck the guns would misfire that intelligence would be faulty that just like in the scriptures how you brought fear into the hearts of the enemy god i asked that you would bring fear into the heart of every single russian soldier who was following an unjust leader at this time i asked that they would run in fear god we join together we see it right in front of our eyes what is taking place and we ask for your intervention i ask that you would cause those that are righteous amongst the military in russia to stand up against their leader and that their nation would rise up against this injustice as well we join together with those across the globe calling out for your assistance in jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you read some of the old testament passages about some of the prayers that that the leaders would ask god to do upon their enemies i think these are good prayers to pray right now specifically to help the ukrainians the uh there is a moment when we must as a people decide if we are going to ask god to do impossible things what we just prayed really sounds impossible but that's okay we pray and ask god to do impossible things all the time and i want you to make sure that you are asking god to intervene in the most impossible situation in your life as well right here right here at home right right now whatever you're facing this day whatever you're facing this week do not be afraid to ask god to do impossible things to partner with god in seeing miracles done this is something that god asked us to do to bring these impossible situations to him and fight alongside of god for these things this friday night we have a young adults gathering uh for those 18 to 30 and we're going to have it at my house as well pastor tanisha will be letting the young adults know about this as well so we invite you to join us for this evening at my house now if you show up at my house and you're 50 years old and you still think you're a young adult i respect that but you're not a young adult anymore all right so you will have to leave you'll have to leave now i don't know if anybody here likes to get messy i mean you really love to get messy and junk all over you and grease and slime and disgusting stuff i don't like that but maybe some of you do remember that nickelodeon show with the kids where they would dump green slime all over the kids or the people and some kids all wanted to be the gut person that got this time dumped on them that's not my thing i never wanted that to happen or how about that tv show hoarders you know the hoarder show listen if you watch that tv show for tips on how to be a better hoarder you are missing the point of that tv show there is something even more complicated even more messy than those things and that's relationships relationships can be messy somebody say messy we're going to take a few weeks to dive in to the messy waters of relationships now that doesn't just mean romantic relationships i'm talking all the relationships friendships marriage dating family all the different complicated relationships that can exist three years ago remember three years ago doesn't it seem like a lifetime ago three years ago relationships were complicated don't you long for those days of just complicated relationships but over the past two years some of those relationships have gone from complicated to simply unbearable people that you used to respect you now have much less respect for in certain situations people that you used to be close to you don't know if you will ever speak to them again it's been a complicated two years on relationships so i wanted to give us a refresher on relationships and some of the keys to having successful relationships so i've looked around and i i found all the the places on the internet and pop culture experts on relationships from our culture icons and i found the eight successful universal keys to good relationships you want to know what they are one perfectly chiseled bodies check we're doing good so far doing good so far two two spending excessive amounts of money on things that have no value all right two check three exotic travel four amazing restaurants five expensive drinks six trendy clothes seven luxury apartments and homes and eight permanently romantic those are the eight listen if you wanna have an ideal relationship those are the eight things that our culture says universally you need to do over and over and over again the relationship gods at disney miramax sony universal 20th century fox netflix hulu and prime and a slew of advertising companies have all contributed to that great list no wonder relationships are so complicated if the end goal of relationships is always this fantasy fairy tale relationships will then ultimately fail to meet this media-driven list of relationship standards if every friendship has to be a bromance with high-speed chases shooting off guns and full of sexual escapades then we're off to a rough start whether male or female there are societally unhealthy patterns or roles that you can easily slip into without even trying to it's just handed to you society is like the giant russia coming after little ukraine and if you don't fight it constantly it will trap you in its web of slavery and deception so to get us started today in this messy series let's jump right in all the way and get as messy as possible today's foundational teaching the starting point on relationships is you it's you it's me james chapter 1 verse 9. understand this my dear brothers and sisters you must all be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to get angry human anger does not produce righteousness god desires so get rid of all filth and evil in your lives and humbly accept the word of god the word god has planted in your hearts for it has the power to save your souls verse 22 says but don't just listen to god's word you must do what it says otherwise you are only fooling yourselves for if you listen to the word and don't obey it is like glancing at your face in the mirror in a mirror you see yourself walk away and forget what you look like but if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free and and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard then god will bless you for doing it for if you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue you are fooling yourselves and your religion is worthless pure and genuine religion in the sight of god the father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you fascinating passage from james in other words it is not possible to only knowledge your way to life change you must act your way to life change you can't just know you must also do lots of us know a lot of things less of us do those things this passage and many others in scripture call us to first look upward then inward before we ever look outward up towards god that we take a hard look at ourselves before we then are prepared to look outward at relationship before you can start any legitimate conversation about having healthy relationships friendships or marriage or dating or family dynamics before you can have that conversation you have to take a real hard look in the mirror remember in the late 80s you had that vinyl record the bad record by michael jackson do you remember that one maybe you didn't have that i had that one don't judge me the songwriter sadia garrett who wrote it she said i'm starting with the man in the mirror i'm asking him to change his ways who knew she stole it from the bible no message could have been any clearer if you want to make the world a better place take a look at yourself then make a change romans chapter 8 says this for we know that god causes everything to work together for the good of those who love god and are called according to his purpose for them as we consider relationships i think it's important that we get this next thing truly understood we believe that god is at work putting things together for our good this does not mean that we believe that god causes everything to happen notice in the passage it says we know that god causes everything it doesn't pause there there's not a period there everything to work together for the good of those who love god he's working it out see it's it's the opposite of god causing everything we believe that satan is actively at work trying to destroy the very fabric of your life and everything that god has created what you're watching on the news every night right now or on cnn or fox or whatever you watch you're seeing the thumbprints of satan all over it you can just see it that wasn't god doing these things that's the enemy doing these things on a macro level that's why wars and poverty and famine happen but on a smaller more micro level it's why individuals like us fall prey to the schemes of satan his stares his straps and his strategies most people that i know struggle with relationships because they have had a giant load of ridiculousness happen in their life so many challenges so much dysfunction in the past and most of these things have been the result of an all-out assault by the enemy of our lives on our life the great mastermind behind these evils and evil period is satan himself so we have to overcome this issue this challenge the life of every human on this planet that will ever be conceived is under the direct and immediate assault from the illegitimate ruler of this world the illegitimate ruler of this world does everything he can to destroy us from the inside out we can easily think of hitler or paul pot or or putin as the great evil rulers of their temporary kingdoms they aggressively set out to a plan to destroy millions upon millions of lives in a much greater sense however satan is trying to destroy the lives of everyone on this planet he is trying to even destroy your ability to have a healthy relationship with anyone for any reason the enemy of your life does not want you to have healthy relationships and so you must fight for them you must contend for them when you live in the kingdom of satan there is destruction death devastation and despair and so i want you to pause for a moment and just think take a snapshot of your past life does it look more like heaven or does it look more like hell a battleground of chaos which does it look like and you can see where you have been influenced when you dance with the devil when you saddle up with satan when you hide out from freedom in the caves of despair when you hike away from the wholeness of the trail of on a trail of brokenness when you run from god under the tradition of religion when you let your life drip away under the illusions of red red wine you will find yourself in a desperate situation flailing around looking for something or someone to come and rescue you maybe there's somebody out there who can fix me maybe somebody out there who's got no issues one popular song back in the day wrote this this is the lyrics i'm standing on a bridge i'm waiting in the dark i thought you would be here by now there's nothing but rain no footsteps on the ground i'm listening but there's no sound very depressing isn't anyone trying to find me won't somebody come take me home it's a cold night trying to figure out this life won't you take me by the hand take me somewhere new i don't know who you are but i'm with you desperate i'm looking for a place i'm searching for a face is anybody here i know because nothing's going right and everything's a mess and no one likes to be alone isn't anyone trying to find me oh i'm just depressed reading that out loud it's really rough but that's the feeling of so many i guarantee that when the enemy of our life our soul sees this feeling upon people hears those lyrics he is smiling ear to ear whispering victory out of an ongoing desperation for connection love and wholeness it is a temptation to reach out and willingly to take whatever or whoever happens to walk by and that allows the enemy just one more chance to jack your whole life up again out of that despair and desperation because friends there is no chance that you can have a healthy relationship or friendship the right relationship with your friends with your spouse with your child with your family while your life is still in a battleground of chaos it is simply not doable so here's the real point of the message today you've got to be right you've got to be right it's not about them it's about you first being right matthew chapter 7 verse 7 jesus says this do not judge others and you will not be judged for you will be treated as you treat others the standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged first three and why worry about the spec in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own how can you think of saying to your friend let me help you get rid of that speck in your own in your eye when you can't see past the log in your own i hypocrite first get rid of the log in your own eye then you will see well enough to deal with the spec in your friend's eye in other words we don't start with the other person's issues we start with our own issues merry christmas everyone merry christmas [Applause] that's the worst present ever right yeah you can't have we can't have a healthy relationship until we are actively embracing and moving towards health in our own life to do right to be in relationship to be in a relationship that is right you've got to be right i mean not like i'm right all the time but like right in your core like you're healthy you've got to be right to relate right you must first be right in order to be right with others other people do not make you whole everybody please just this would make my life so much easier if everybody just believe this next line here other people do not make you whole regardless of what the movies say other people do not complete you it's a good line but it's not true a house will not complete you a child will not complete you a business will not complete you a job will not complete you an awesome church will not complete you these things can complement you they can compel you they can challenge you but only god can complete you now as we're talking about this don't don't slip into this other thing either when we're talking about this i don't mean you need to go find yourself you know you just like people say this to me sometimes i gotta find myself or somebody will say something about somebody else so he's just finding himself kind of in the i just need some time away sense or i'm still finding myself sense most people here's the truth most people know exactly who they are and they just don't like it and it's painful to address it it's difficult it's hard now don't fall into despair even though i'm saying all kinds of horrible things only god this is the hope only god and god can bring healing and wholeness and health and completeness to our lives and we instead of looking to our ultimate rescuer our healer and god sometimes we flail about looking for a rascal or a rascalita to help us i don't know if that's a word we try to cover up our brokenness we cower in shame for our sin ravaged life we try to patch over our hurt with pleasure or entertainment or numbness manufacturing ways to hide that pain traditional relationships and boundaries haven't worked so far and so out of an inner longing to not be alone we've even moved so far is to go to non-traditional relationships literally of every imaginable kind there's just a sense of desperation no wonder relationships are complicated that's where we start from from the first moment that most children can remember they are indoctrinated with the theology of disney and the idea of relationships that relationships are a fairy tale of roses and candy and butterflies and swords and horses and long blonde hair we are now living in a generation of disillusionment where the idea even the idea of a man and a woman having a healthy relationship and raising a healthy family and living a loving life is fundamentally doubted or mocked or scorned it seems impossible the reality of the american experience is that many relationships suck bad friendships filled with drama dysfunctional families that are drowning in despair shallow and defiling romances and if they are so bad then why do people keep trying to get into them i'm not saying anything that anybody doesn't know already why do people keep trying to get into them because there is an inner longing that we all have to not be alone the fear of loneliness is overwhelming the adrenaline of that first few weeks with a new friend or a new romance still drive people to keep on trying but if we go back to the beginning you cannot be in a good good in a relationship until you are good with yourself and you cannot be good with yourself until you are right with god that's the order people try to be in a good relationship so that they can be good with themselves so that they can be good with god and have it completely backwards and that brings us all the way back around to the earlier passage from romans chapter 8. we know that god causes everything to work together for the good of those who love god and are called according to his purpose for them god literally takes the pieces of wreckage that life has left and he sculpts them to favor his children all of that junk all of that drama all of that trauma all of the stuff in the past that has been passed on to you or given to you or handed to you god is at work right now sculpting it together for your good he has a way if we trust him of restoring the brokenness even if that brokenness is something we caused ourselves there is this critically important statement that comes straight from the mouth of jesus if you have that picture i gave you earlier you can put it up jesus is hanging out in jerusalem that's not jesus in case you're wondering jesus is hanging out in jerusalem he had just performed his first public miracle in cana and he was gone down to jerusalem and he's on his way up to the temple and he's on the steps that i'm sitting at right there as he's going up to the temple and he sees all of these merchants along the side exploiting people who have come to worship god they're they're being exploited by these people and jesus launches into this iconic moment where he goes over to the merchants tables and he flips over their tables and there's money and the animals it's just chaos that he creates and jesus in this moment is establishing his authority that this is his father's house to anybody paying attention that jesus was not just another teacher not simply another guest on a ted talk not simply another prophet not just the next individual to hit a million followers on youtube not simply another king but jesus is the king the king of all kings and the lord of all lords and that's this moment and we lead right from this moment we go to nicodemus nicodemus was a religious leader and he meets with jesus right after this moment and as nicodemus and jesus are chatting jesus says in john chapter 3 some of the most important words that have ever been spoken you know the first part probably i mean if you've ever watched football you probably know this john 3 16. for this is how god loved the world he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life a lot of times you stop there verse 17 this is really important as you think in terms of your life your relationships your history your baggage your drama your trauma all of it jesus said god sent his son into the world not to judge the world but to save the world through him there is no judgment against anyone who believes in him those are the really important words for us today there is no judgment against anyone who believes in him what jesus himself promises is that he will rescue anyone that believes in him that he isn't there to judge you for the chaos but rather to rescue you to heal you and to make you whole and that when he rescues you he will begin to take everything that satan has stolen from you has satan stolen anything from you the promise of jesus is that he begins to restore everything that the devil has deceived you about everything that this lord of the flies has ruined in your life and god the god above all gods the king above all kings the great rescuer of our life will take that pile of garbage that heap of pain and he will redeem it and cause it to do good for you he will recycle it and he will work it together for your good and in so doing he brings destruction to the work of the enemy in your life he takes that ugly and he makes it beautiful and in those moments the illegitimate ruler of this world loses you as a citizen of his kingdom and now you become a citizen of the kingdom of god and in god's kingdom there is freedom and in god's kingdom there is justice there is joy in god's kingdom there is healing and deliverance in god's kingdom there is health and wholeness and repentance and forgiveness in god's kingdom logs that are removed from the eyes of people are celebrated as trophies of god's grace and in god's kingdom fear is replaced with a sound mind and god's kingdom relationships are in fact a little taste of heaven relationships are a place of refuge in the face of the storms of life relationships are a place where dreams are cultivated and developed as the worship team comes up and relationships are a place where family and friends are growing and vibrant in god's kingdom so when we say start with you that's how you start with you it is difficult to have a healthy a good relationship until you are good with yourself and you cannot be good with yourself until you are good with god that's the you got to be right to be right so today here's the challenge would you give god access would you be so bold and so courageous to say to god today god i give you access to my deepest brokenness the thing that you don't want to talk about to anybody you don't even want to talk about it to god would you give god access to it today would you give god would you trust god enough to give god access to the most difficult hurt in your life these are not easy asks this is not an easy thing to do but would you give god access [Music] to the battlefield of your past the chaos the destruction why [Music] would you give god access to those things so that you can experience the love of god and let the love of god bring you back to life so that he may literally love you to life that he may bind up your broken heart that he may take the parts of you that have been taken captive and set those parts free [Music] see this is exactly what jesus does he wants us to have that full and grace-filled abundant life and he wants us to have relationships that are healthy and strong and whole he wants us to be the people that are right with him right with ourselves so that we can be right with others would you stand with me as we close [Music] so we titled this series messi because everything we just talked about is super messy it's messy so as the worship team leads us in this i invite you give god access let him begin to heal you just begin to spill it all out let jesus do his work the altars are open let's take some time today [Music] we invite you to join us tomorrow monday february 28th from 6 to 7 pm for the women's recovery meeting at the mansion

Jesus told him I am the way the truth and the life no one can come to the father except through me who can come to the father except through him no one this is exclusive Jesus is saying you got to make a choice it's either me or not either I'm telling you the truth or I'm lying or I'm crazy and so he's requiring his followers to decide you're all in with me or you're not in it all so this is some back and forth discussion going on between Jesus and his disciples or his closest followers on this fateful Last Supper evening that we read about in John 14. and so verse 6 is what I just read verse 12 there's a little bit more discussion going on and Jesus says in response I tell you the truth anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done if I was in the room my ears would have perked up at that okay and even greater works somebody said Greater Works because I'm going to be with the father so Jesus areas in the room with his disciples the Last Supper they're talking and Jesus continued on talking about many other things thankfully one of the fellows in the room was taking notes so we know the rest of what he said because if I was in the room when Jesus said that we would do even greater things than Jesus had done my mind would have been racing with a hundred different questions forming in my brain that would have been a distraction to anything else Jesus said so it's always important for us to know you know what's going on what is Jesus saying what's the context of Everything Jesus says and how it plays out both before during and after and so this fall we're going to be diving deep into the book of Acts to see what exactly Jesus meant by this how is it that we should be living a life of greater things than Jesus how can our lives be lived in response and so today as an example we're going to jump ahead uh to a story an account in the book of Acts chapter 3 to give you an idea of what we're talking about now first off let me set up Acts for a moment there was this doctor named Luke who wrote a book about the life of Jesus in all of the happenings however when he wrote this book it is important to note that even though it is a historical account of Jesus and the church it functions in many aspects as a manual also both history and Emmanuel marching orders he would he would write about Jesus or write about an early Christian leader he would write about what happened and then the clear implication was that okay this is what Jesus did this is what you should do it was a here's the example here's the execution for you the second half of the book that Luke wrote is called Acts The Acts of the Apostles again Dr Luke historically records many of the acts of the first churches and the first Christian leaders he does so in order for us to understand our role in God's Kingdom how it is that you and I how we should be engaging with the world around us a couple of months ago the Bible engagement goal was to read the book of Acts and hopefully this will serve as a clarifying series again this kind of history is different than history and other historical textbooks because this is not written about specifically for the purpose of date and time and place rather it is a historical story with the clear intent of the reader or the hearer of taking that information and doing something with the information you just read that means we are not simply supposed to know it we're supposed to do it it's really important every once in a while when people are praying Lord we just want to get to know you better today we want to know more about you today you know there's a lot of knowing language the Bible's filled with lots of doing language that go and do do fact if if Luke if Dr Luke wrote this and then had you read it he would give you a test he would give you a test at the end of each week where you would read or the end of each passage that you had read and the questions on the test that he would give you would be different he would not be concerned about who healed who or which blind man was it or which gate was it or which thing was it all those things are in there but that's not what he would be concerned about the questions would go more like this what is the name of the blind person you prayed for last week which demonic Force did you identify this week and how are you tearing down that stronghold how did you serve and love your neighbor the one you don't like so that that's the kind of test you would get from Dr Luke and so this is the kind of intentionality in your reading you need to have with Acts the reader is not to observe and hoard the knowledge which is what we're basically thought to do all through school right take knowledge and kind of hold it in here we're supposed to participate with the text it's it's it's living active uh text that is actively working and changing our lives we're simply act uh working with it so we're jumping into Acts chapter 3 verse one first uh Peter and John went to the temple one afternoon to take part in a three o'clock prayer service as they approached the temple a man lame from birth was care being carried in each day he was put beside the Temple Gate the one called the beautiful gate so he could beg from the people going into the temple when he saw Peter and John about to enter he asked them for some money Peter and John looked at him intently and Peter said look at us the the lame man looked at them eagerly expecting some money but Peter said I don't have any silver or gold for you but I'll give you what I have in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene get up and walk then Peter took the lame man by the right hand helped him up and as he did the man's feet and ankles were instantly healed and strengthened he jumped up stood on his feet and began to walk then walking leaping and praising God he went into the temple with them so it's a great story now the book of Acts is loaded with this stuff the book of Acts is the Encounters of the early church the early Christian leaders the early Christian people and how they engage with the world around them again it's three o'clock in the afternoon The Hour of Prayer of the Temple Peter and John are heading up with the crowd into the house of God and on the way in they go through this beautiful gate and they came across the man who had been crippled since birth a man so lame he couldn't hobble along even with the aid of a crutch instead he had to be carried everywhere he had some good friends who would carry him every day lay him down at the entrance to the gate as people began to pray if you didn't know this he wasn't allowed inside the temple to join in prayer because he was crippled because of their spiritual Pride people felt that he was blemished not fit for the house of God and so he sat on the steps and begged and people gave him their Loose Change to ease their conscience as they went to pray but as Peter and John approached this particular day he saw them and he asked them for money it says in verse 3. and I've noticed this in life so often people will ask for the wrong thing because it's all they know to ask for the deepest need of this man and the deepest need of all of humans is a touch from God but if you don't have the context or the words to express what's going on in your heart or even have the emotional availability to understand what's going on in your heart the void is real there's a real void in the soul but the felt need blurs their spiritual vision from seeing what they really need and here's a situation where a man is in true desperate need he was physically unable to participate as a result he was an outcast his friends would bring him to beg but nobody was allowed to bring him into the temple to worship because those in his condition weren't allowed his own religious Traditions actually kept him away from God it kept him away from authentic Community kept him away from actually being healed so much so that apparently he didn't even know he was allowed to ask to be healed maybe he thought he missed his opportunity maybe that's what's going on and track with me in the story today some of this isn't in the text but you can see it if you look close perhaps in his anger or bitterness about his disability or tragedy he had missed his chance you see when I say maybe he missed his chance this was a very real sense for this man because Jesus had often visited this exact Temple and passed through this exact gate and saw this exact man but Jesus isn't there anymore it says in Matthew 21 the blind man and the lame man came to him in the temple and he healed them what this means is that this man who was a frequent beggar at the gate was there when other people with similar situations as him Found Jesus or called out to Jesus or rushed to Jesus but for some reason he didn't I've often wondered why Jesus didn't heal this man Jesus it appears responded to people in faith the people that had faith in him and perhaps for whatever reason this man just wasn't quite ready yet he just couldn't get there perhaps this man out of his Brokenness had become a skeptic or a cynic or a mocker maybe it was more practical maybe he just didn't want to lose his begging spot because he might not be able to get it back but I do wonder when his friends the blind people and the other crippled people became healed and came streaming out of the temple rejoicing at the change in their life I do wonder why didn't he yell out to Jesus maybe it was courage maybe he lacked courage to yell over the crowds as Jesus walked by maybe he was burdened with some immense amount of Shame whatever it was the man was lame from birth he didn't know how to walk all he knew was begging it was his life and even Jesus passed him by even Jesus didn't notice or at least that's what he thought and he thought that all hope was now lost because Jesus wasn't coming back to the temple anymore because he had heard that Jesus had been crucified it was all over town he had probably heard a couple of people debating whether or not Jesus had come back to life because rumors were starting to spread that Jesus had come back to life and I imagine he would have thought this is just crazy talk these are just crazy people talking I want you to catch this today and the story Bears it out Jesus always notices Jesus always notices so don't give up on God because God will never give up on you and even if we've given up on ourselves and even if we've settled for status quo God is still working behind the scenes on a plan to rescue you to find you to get to you even if it means rescuing you from yourself yeah I want you to think about this today have you ever made a decision in your life to settle to just keep things normal to go with the flow to not make waves to stay and protect what you have instead of advancing or increasing or becoming the person that you know that God wants you to be maybe it's too risky what if it doesn't work out what if I lose what I have what will people say if it doesn't work what will people say if it does work what if Jesus doesn't actually show up it's a lot of stuff going on inside of our heads sometimes I assure you of this Jesus never wants you to settle and he didn't want this beggar to settle that he had seen so often so Jesus does what Jesus so often does Jesus sends him a second chance verse 4 the second chance turns out to be a guy named Peter Peter looked at him intently looked at him intently he saw him a lot of people out there are just invisible but you're never invisible to God no one else would have anything to do with this man but Peter saw him and did not turn away you see the people believed that such a man must be a very bad sinner or maybe his parents were it was the common cultural understanding in their thinking that the man was crippled as a punishment from God but as Peter saw him remember Peter is part of the popular culture this is probably something that he had thought at one point in his life but as Peter is looking at him intently I wonder if he heard the words of Jesus in his ears in a situation that he had seen some time before where Jesus healed a man and the question was neither this man nor his parents sinned Jesus said and I wonder if Peter heard that in that moment what we know about people is this when we don't understand something when it seems too big to wrap our head around we just make stuff up War famine disease destruction disabilities tragedies addictions etc etc etc we just start making stuff up to try to explain it away and it's a frequent occurrence in our culture the most popular thing for people to say is well if God was good why would he let stuff happen like this all kinds of variations of that the thing that I want you to catch is that these are all things the Bible clearly describes as works of Satan these are the the evidence is that this is the Fingerprints of Satan all all over these horrible things not the Fingerprints of God the Fingerprints of Satan that's why Jesus opposed the works of Satan wherever he found them so fiercely so that we could understand the difference it's why he instructed his followers to continue with his mission of advancing the kingdom of God and to do even greater things Greater Works this is why so here we have Peter this guy who had previously jumped out of a boat to walk on water with Jesus fun stuff the guy who tried to turn the arrest of Jesus into an uprising the guy who betrayed Jesus misstep the same guy who then Jesus restored after he rose from the dead and now Jesus is ascended to the father and filled Peter with the Holy Spirit and what does he do in that moment notice it says that Peter looked at him the man intently I imagine this was a moment of decision for Peter like what do I do what am I supposed to do and this is what Peter does he does what Jesus used to do he does what Jesus used to do that's a good idea friends do what Jesus did he notices somebody that everybody else ignored he sees a guy that he has seen a hundred times before but this time he sees him differently he sees him with the eyes of God he sees his predicament and he determines something deep within his soul oh no this guy's not going to stay here anymore this man is no longer going to stay in this horrible position and he takes authority over the man's situation verse 6 it says he says in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene get up and walk now this is great it's a great moment what if it doesn't work out we know that we've already read the end so you know it works out but Authority was taken in the name of Jesus and it's interesting for me to know they didn't even have a prayer service right before apparently they were already prayed up and just going out and doing what Jesus told him to do they simply did what they had been instructed to do by Jesus a more modern Christian leader once said expect great things from God attempt great things for God a lot of us can get to the expect part expect things from God but there's a big jump to starting to attempt great things for God like it's it's for whatever reason we stumble at that point the attempting part in this particular moment in the story the potential reign of the enemy's destruction was that Jeopardy in this man's life the enemy had had been having a Heyday with this man's life his whole life but the rules had just changed and the beggar who was asking for a nickel was about to need a brand new pair of Nikes those things are expensive too he needed more than a nickel um but this man this man was in the path that God had directed Peter and John on what is the what is the path that God has directed you on now a lot of times like people are like praying God show me your purposes show me your plan show me your will you want to like the next great thing that God has for you or the first great thing that God has for you but I want to know I want to show you this here in the text do you know the great thing that Peter and John were going to do at three o'clock on that day they were going to church they were just doing normal life part of their normal life was worship they were just doing the stuff that God had already asked them to do and while they were doing this stuff that God God is clearly already asked them to do people somehow end up in their way and friends that's exactly how God works you just do the stuff he's already asked you to do excel at the fundamentals we don't need any more rock stars excel at the fundamentals and God will put people in your way who's in your path who has been drawn to you who has been asking you already already for the wrong things because they didn't know how to ask for the right things and I want you to go through life paying attention to those around you that God has not forgotten and he's just trying to get you to look at them intently to see who they are to that crippled beggar who thought that Jesus had left him behind turns out Jesus had not forgotten him at all I want you to go ahead be filled with the Holy Spirit and walk in such a manner that you will understand that God has something already in place for you so the worship team comes up I know you want me to preach four times longer but I'm not going to I've been to that church um listen you've been commissioned to take Authority in the name of Jesus to the last to the lost to the least to the confused to the broken to those who walk in darkness to those who have been overcome by Despair and to those that who have out of fear of rejection simply miss their moments with Jesus maybe they were scared or skeptical or uncertain or misled or maybe they confuse God for the Fallen Humanity around them let's make sure to give them a second chance or a seven thousandth chance it doesn't really matter because if Jesus gave you another chance then maybe we should share the wealth if he can give you a second chance he can give anybody a second chance and there's some of you I probably wouldn't have given you a second chance but God did but God did right and so your your job is not your job is to do what Jesus wants you to do right and so thank God he gives us Second Chances you stand with me I want you to notice something that's going on around here kind of as we're coming out as we've come out of covid something there's like a theme that's taking place amongst many in our in our newcomers luncheon our start dinner and access one of the things we're finding out is there's many of you here now who God isn't entirely unfamiliar to you like when you were young we've had some family story with God maybe somebody taught you you misstepped along the way got sidetracked believed lies decided you were God and you were just going to do your own thing and after a couple of Decades of getting your ribs kicked in you realize it's you know what maybe I don't have it all figured out well first off welcome home welcome home [Applause] but the second thing I want to make sure you get is you've been given a second chance to give a second chance [Music] don't squander your second chance [Music] today if you are in need [Music] I wonder if your spirit can still hear the words that Peter said in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene get up and walk those words don't disappear those words still remain true today in the name of Jesus Christ get up and be free in the name of Jesus Christ hatred be released in the name of Jesus Christ's bitterness can be over in the name of Jesus Christ get up and let sickness fall off of you in the name of Jesus Christ get up and let despair go and surrender to the Peace Love and Hope of Jesus Christ [Music] friends if your spirit is resonating with that today if Jesus is still calling you if you can hear those words in the name of Jesus Christ get up and walk why don't you just come up and agree with me today around this altar that Jesus wants to do something in your life today that Jesus do something in your life today go ahead in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ hear the name of Jesus Christ just go ahead just begin to pray right where you're at let's give it over to Jesus of all the stories in the Bible this particular story I wish we had a video shot of Jesus sitting at the right hand of the father when this moment happened [Music] because he was planning it from before the foundations of the Earth [Music] he had been wanting this to happen for a very long time and finally it was there [Music] I also want to ask some of you today [Music] as you're reflecting and giving this over to God today seriously who's on your path who was on your path that you need to notice [Music] what Authority do you need to take over the destructive work of the enemy in someone's life [Music] where is the rule of Satan need to be destroyed [Music] and as you give that to God today invite the spirit of God show you and direct you and to lead you so that together we can experience the God of Peace crushing Satan underneath our feet so the worship team leads us let's just continue to pray", "all right good morning everyone hey great to be with you today we have a couple of things uh to make sure that you're aware of uh just want to make sure that you're aware that we are hiring an admin role here at the church and if you are interested in some type of admin role there is a way for you to ask for the information at office ecic.tv for that in the back of the room today you'll notice that there are a few books that have been laid out these are recommended books for you during Black History Month and if if you don't if you're not prepared to purchase one today that's fine we just really want to make you aware of the fact that there are some very good authors that we would like to introduce you to and so you can look at those books and you can get them online or you can pick one up today as well but Jamar tisby is an author that I've been hoping to introduce to you for quite some time and so this is an opportunity to do so so please pick one up on your way out or uh this week online as we're talking about reading here we've as a church been reading through uh portions of the Bible together in January we all read through the Book of Mark together this month we're trying to read through the Book of James and the book of First John together and so James is very short if you haven't started it yet it's not too late you could probably wrap it up today uh and then first John is also quite short but we want you to take a look at those and what you're trying to do this time is identify who the author is who the audience is and then what date it was written those are the things that you're trying to pay attention for this month now I want to want to read you a passage of scripture today from the book of Acts chapter 2. says this in the last days God says I will pour out my spirit upon all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams in those days I will pour out my spirit even on my servants men and women alike and they will prophesy I read that passage to you today uh to let you know that there is a very clear sense in Scripture that God is going to pour out his spirit in a very powerful way that will draw people to himself and over the centuries this has happened multiple times where it's more than just like regular it's like something unique something powerful something Supernatural I just want to give you a heads up on something that's happening in our own Nation right now in the middle of our country there has been what appears to be a significant outpouring of the Holy Spirit that's taking place on college campuses it's very significant and when I mean significant it's been taking place for about a week and a half now it started in a little college called Asbury College in Kentucky and when I say an outpouring for those that are paying attention to this it's very reminiscent of a movement that took place in the United States back in the late 60s and early 70s called the Jesus people movement that really brought transformation to a whole generation and when I say that something significant happened it started in this in this building it sees a little over a thousand people and each night they've each day they've had because they've had to keep expanding it to other other buildings on campus and other buildings on campus last night people from literally all over the world it started coming people from all over the United States driving um it it's really a very unique situation all the buildings were full last night and just praise and adoration and repentance and Thanksgiving with over ten thousand people outside that couldn't get in just kind of watching on a big screen and and joining in worship together in 30 degree weather over ten thousand people without tens of thousands of people so I'm bringing it up to you to say this God is clearly up to something and for Generation Z is 25 and under I want you to pay attention to this that God is not going to give up on your generation and he's coming for your generation and he's wants to use your generation to impact the whole world and so pay attention to what's happening pay attention to what the holy spirit is doing in the world today now we are in the middle of our series called Financial ethics in the kingdom and this is part two and today we are going to be specifically thinking in terms of Ethics around Financial wisdom uh on the screen right now you will see an advertisement and the advertisement on the screen it's for a watch so it looks like a nice watch right this is not just a regular nice watch this is a petite Philippe okay I know you don't know what it is okay that's fine fine and I also know that maybe none of you have this watch okay and if you do it's probably a knockoff but if it's not a knockoff talk to me later um so on the advertisement it says this you never actually own a petite Philippe you merely take care of it for the next Generation all right it's an interesting ad it's very interesting now let me show you a closer up image on another petite Philippe Watch and so here it is and when I say these are pricey watches I mean this watch is 8.5 million dollars that's you heard me right 8.5 million dollars so you better take care of it and pass it on to the next Generation right so here's the idea behind this is that you don't own it you Steward it okay well today in our financial series we're talking about this idea that ultimately everything is owned by God what that means is you and I we don't own anything that's ownership is an illusion Genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth God did the creating not us the ultimate ownership of all things ultimately goes back to God this is an important principle financially and for you to be ethical in your dealing with finances Psalm chapter 50 says I do not need the Bulls from your barns or the goats from your pens for all the animals of the forest are mine I own the cattle on a thousand hills I know every bird on the mountains and all the animals of the field are mine if I were hungry I would not tell you for all the world is mine and everything in it everything belongs to God in other words the stuff that you have you just Steward You Don't Own we use the language of ownership like I own my house or I own my car but our attitude should not be that of this kind of owner or like ultimate owner but as stewards passing things on from generation to generation but not simply in a selfish way for me and my own type of way but in an ever expanding kind of way and something that that just kind of explodes in this manner not in this manner not in a straight linear line watch this from the moment God spoke the universe into existence it has been expanding it has just kept on expanded it's never stopped expanding in fact scientists today tell us that in the universe as it is expanding it is expanding really fast in fact it is expanding at a Hubble constant value of 73 plus or minus one kilometer per second per Mega parsec that seems fast to me I have no idea what that means by the way it can actually mean really really slow but I think it means really fast the point I'm trying to make is that the good things God gets involved in creased they expand so if your stewardship of the resources God has entrusted to you is insular or linear only and not expansive then it should be reconsidered the petite Philippe ad is actually only about 50 percent right you see it IT addresses the idea of me like my own personal financial goals like you're doing pretty well if you can afford the watch um then their family financial goals like he's going to pass it down to the Next Generation so it's me and mine but it's not take into account the scriptural ideas of Community financial goals of hours a corporate finances and then Global Financial goals like others so Me Mine ours and others so when we think about the kingdom finances and stewardship it should be expanding outward not just Inward and downward to our own people the clear teaching of scripture there's a lot of teaching in scripture about money a few things that's really really clear about is this first off is be careful with money somebody say be careful so be careful be careful be careful with money First Timothy chapter 6 says For the Love of Money it's the love it's not money that's the problem it's the Love of Money the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil and some people craving money have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows why because they loved money first second it tells us to be wise with money Proverbs 14 24 says wealth is a crown for the wise the effort of fools yields only foolishness okay be wise when it comes to money and be generous with money Acts chapter 20 you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus it is more blessed to give than to receive so generosity those are just just three quick things the idea here is that the Bible says a lot about money and a lot of wisdom about it there are many more principles that we find in scripture about it as well one time there was a moment with Jesus and there was a fella in the crowd that had a financial situation he was dealing with and he's like maybe Jesus can take care of this for me and so he yells out to Jesus and asked Jesus to address it here's the story then someone called from the crowd teacher please tell my brother that cracks me up he wants Jesus to instruct somebody else he doesn't want Jesus to instruct him that is a common issue please tell my brother to divide our father's estate with me so he's having some inheritance issues Jesus replied friend who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that then he said Beware guard against every kind of greed life is not measured by how much you own then he told them a story watch the story carefully a rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops he said to himself what should I do I don't have room for all my crops then he said I know I'll tear down my Barns and build bigger ones then I'll have enough room to store all my wheat and other goods and I'll sit back and say to myself my friend you have enough stored away for years to come now take it easy eat drink and be merry but God said to him you fool you will die this very night then you will get everything then who will get everything you worked for yes a person is a fool to store up Earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God this is an interesting passage this is the don't build bigger silos don't build bigger barns verse in the Bible this is essentially Jesus saying you can't take it with you in other words there's no U-Hauls behind hearses at a funeral procession right except for this picture um and other there is at some point a line A Line in the Sand where enough is enough is enough you don't need a bigger Barn to store it enough is enough now there is definitely a moment when we can do this where and it's also actually really not okay to keep hoarding all the stuff all the wealth now this might feel to you today like it doesn't apply to you maybe you're thinking to yourself I am so glad that Pastor Kurt is talking to those rich people out there right now well just because you don't have millions and millions of dollars and if you do that's fine in many ways this teaching is really the anecdote to hoarding think about this do you ever find yourself hoarding things and how is it any different than building bigger silos what's that all about what's the hoarding thing all about well I'll tell you what it's about it's about fear it's about control trying to control your the situation trying to you're trying to trust yourself and not trust God that's what it's really about if you've ever experienced food insecurity in your life this is an issue for you probably you have so much food in your house now and so much of it goes bad what's what's that all about that's about food insecurity and fear and control or if you've ever experienced different traumas in your life and you're trying to surround yourself with all the stuff so that it can never happen again trying to control every possible thing at some point we have to move away from it we have to trust God we have to trust God now at some point you also have to say to yourself I've moved from preparing for the future to hoarding and whatever that line is saying for you is it's important for you to know because once the Silo's full don't tear it down to build another being wise with money and stuff and trusting God are the things that we must constantly be assessing in our life and the reason it needs to be constantly is because things change so quickly in our lives maybe we've made a decision in one moment that needs to change many years later and so we're assessing throughout the process in fact ultimately Financial wisdom requires us to recognize that all the things belong to God and it is to be entrusted to God for his purposes over and over and over again not just once it's like why did that 12 years ago well he's asking us to do it constantly and trust it all to him all the time now we're going to shift gears here and then it'll come back around here in life we all have burdens some have physical burdens handicaps chronic sicknesses some of these things you cannot change the child with special needs a parent going through an illness some have spiritual burdens and it may be that something like hurricane Satan has struck your life in the surge of sin is soaked your soul and now you are suffering spiritual consequences as a result some have emotional burdens like depression or anxiety a heartache over some loss or a financial reversal the disappointment of a broken marriage the death of a dream the truth is we all have problems and cares and they weigh down on us like a burden on the back now listen to Galatians chapter 6. it says brothers and sisters if someone is caught in a sin you who live by the spirit should restore that person gently but watch yourselves or you may also be tempted carry each other's burdens somebody say burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ carry each other's burdens in the kingdom of God burdens are meant to be shared you see in the Kingdom Joys are multiplied and Sorrows are divided that's sharing the burden if somebody is caught in sin like ensnared or trapped or snatched that's distinct from those people that just simply refuse like they're just choosing to stay there this is different rather than pointing accusing fingers or shooting our wounded we should help people back up when they have fallen help them get back on track we are supposed to encourage and strengthen one another when it comes to faults and failures to help with the burden at any given time in our in our body we have somebody under a heavy burden of grief so be kind to everyone for everybody has sorrow in their life at some point you see tragedy and sorrow and disappointment and depression and grief eventually visit the home of every person so be kind all the time it's a heavy burden and if we are kind it divides the burden have you ever seen somebody back when we used to have snow before global warming that you know have you ever have you ever seen somebody or remember it in the distant past stuck in the snow or ice in their car and they they just needed one more person to come along to help push them out and you just happen to be that person and so you get out and you help push them and you have just enough strength added to all the other people's strength to make the thing get out and be unstuck well there are many thousands of people struggling to get some heavy burden up over a hill or unstuck and you and I together probably have just enough strength added to theirs to make the thing go you see we shouldn't be expected to carry a boulder by ourselves it would break our backs we need to help with Boulders those times of Crisis and tragedy in our lives those things are called burdens we carry and share one another's burdens if you are also able to assist with somebody's Financial burdens that would be amazing as well but in order to assist with the burden of another and I do believe it is the heart of everybody here that you would want to do that in order to do so we must previously this is important so I said previously previously we must previously have wisely and obediently entrusted our finances to God as he has already instructed every time every single time you get on an airplane you are given a whole bunch of instructions that you probably ignore but one of them is if the oxygen Mass drop put the mask on yourself first before helping other people why because every time you want to be part of helping to relieve another burden but if not yet properly attended to your own financial situation you are not able to do what God has asked you to do you want to do it but you're not in a position to do it because you weren't wise before so the wisdom part is critical in order to help with another's burdens burdens need to be shared but loads Are Meant To Be shouldered by ourselves somebody say loads there's burdens and there's loads we'll continue the scripture if anyone thinks they are something when they are not they deceive themselves each one should test their own actions then they can take pride in themselves alone without comparing themselves to someone else for each one should carry their own load there's burdens and there's loads the loads of life we're supposed to carry by ourself the burdens we're supposed to share there are some with burdens which no one else can there are some burdens that no which no one else can help you with or loads and examples of these loads that should be considered there are many consequences of personal sin that are not burdens they are loads we live in a day and a time when people want to sin but ignore the consequences of it they want to figure out a way to avoid the consequence of the sin that makes sense it's human nature to want to do that the problem is we are in such a mess today because we don't take personal responsibilities for the individual choices that we make now I understand that certain things in our past can predispose us to certain things but as free will human beings we still make our own choices and when we choose to sin we unleash the consequence of that sin that God is so plainly warned us about he's warned us the warning is to help us from not doing it but when we do it there is pain that becomes part of our life and God uses that pain he doesn't cause it but he uses it God uses the pain to mature us and to reach out to us but when we attempt to take the place of God and try to stand in the way of the pain gift for another person then we interrupt what God is trying to do in some way that might sound mean-spirited but in reality it is necessary in order for us to mature into healthy and godly people like those baby birds that are trying to get out of their shell they need to do it on their own or it will harm their maturing process we when we are involved in letting people wrestle with their own load it's not meant to be mean it's oftentimes meant to be restorative or maturing we learned last week about the ethic of work which means that God does not enable irresponsible Behavior irresponsible behavior is not rewarded and hunger is a consequence of laziness Proverbs chapter 16 says the appetite of laborers works for them their hunger drives them on in other words it's a gift it might be a little pain and uncomfort for a season but it's a gift to help you carry your own load as the worship team comes up to wrap this up the load idea is to carry your own weight by using your gifts you use your gifts to carry your weight and one of the responsibilities of each of us individually is to prepare ourselves financially so that your Generous Heart can be put to good use because of your financial wisdom let me say it really plainly if you have not been financially wise you cannot be the generous person you want to be you start with the financial wisdom everyone contributing their own part makes the whole Community Thrive and other individuals thrive in ways that they never could have on their own because we are sharing the burdens you have to be prepared to follow through with this several years ago I was in a critical moment in my life and I just needed to get away and pray I just needed to go pray for a long time so I went to the airport and I got in a plane and I flew to Nicaragua then I got on a bus that I got on a leaky Ferry crossed middle of the giant Lake into the middle where there's an island two of two volcanoes make up this island it's called omatepe no cell reception no internet access it was perfect nobody could find me I just needed to talk to Jesus I get to the island much much many many hours later that I was supposed to and so I had to hitchhike to this socialist coffee plantation that I was saving staying at for a dollar 25 a night real true 1.25 a night and if I wanted to eat while I was there too I had to pay a dollar 75 a night so so I I went ahead and paid 1.75 a night to eat it was great but it's like over there I got there and I just spent the week praying the reading Bible journaling it's a great week one day I towards the end I went for a walk down a path and there's all these trees and fruit trees all around everywhere where I was at and I see this young kid now to me he looked like he was six but he was probably ten and he was just like built like he was just muscles no body fat whatsoever just built and his parents uh it turns out it sent him out to go get some bananas and so he went out and he climbed up the tree cut down a giant thing of bananas like a giant they're kind of like on a on a big thing and he cuts them off the tree and he brings them down and I can see this all happening as I'm walking because it was a long walk and so he throws him on his back and he's like this and he's carrying him it turns out that he's carrying them to his parents store where they can sell the bananas so I mean it was pretty it looked pretty heavy but I'm thinking to myself he's just a kid how heavy could it be so after I talked into him for a while kind of I catch up with him and we're talking in my broken Spanish and and I figured out all this information that I just shared with you and then I make the worst decision of my life I offered to help him with the bananas so he smiles and he says okay so I take the banana the bananas and I could barely lift them okay and he would just had him over his back like it was no big deal I I could barely lift him but at this point Pride kicks in right you know you're like okay I just offered to help I can't give the bananas back to the skid so I figured out I get him on my back and the next 20 minutes of my life for the worst 20 minutes of my life as I'm walking struggling pretending not like it's no big deal like dying inside the problem is this I was in I was so out of shape I was so out of shape I was not prepared to actually help him I was moving so slow I'm sure he just wanted to take him back to get back to the like that's how bad it was I was I was harming him I was not helping him in any way I was not prepared properly prepared to assist my young friend with the bananas and I'm afraid that so often that's the position we get into in our everyday life we want to do it but we're not prepared to so let's go back to the beginning let's prepare ourselves to assist through our wise behaviors including our wise Financial behaviors why don't you stand with me as we close so here's here's some questions to reflect on and to pray about consider what moment are you at in life right now are you in a moment when you need to prepare yourself to share the burden of someone else or you're not preparation season are you in a place where you can identify that you're trying to build bigger silos and you just need to stop hoarding [Music] are you carrying your own load or somehow you just are expecting other people to do it [Music] are you in need of wisdom today because if you're in need of wisdom about this the Bible says you can ask God for wisdom and he'll give it to you so you need to ask God for wisdom at any time we talk about money or even say the word money in church on a Sunday it does something to you the room changes people get antsy they're looking at their clock it's just in a different way because it's complicated and we feel insecure and there's all kinds of stuff around it and it's just a little bit overwhelming I remind you of the words of Jesus today who says come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light the Yoke of Jesus the burden is light it is not heavy light let's lean into that today the altars are open let's spend some time responding and reflecting today as the worship team leads us", "[Applause] today we honor those families and those that have made that ultimate sacrifice and we thank them today let's give them a thank you one more time thank you so as we move forward here uh our small groups are happening uh starting today as our uh we have them throughout the week and you can sign up for one

soon this is the a great event where children become vegans following this event when they see where their food really comes from so uh please please join us for that sign up but i i've heard rumor that we're doing axe throwing this year uh so uh i'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing so hopefully it's a good thing so we're going to work on some axe throwing there so today as we're jumping into our series taking back what the enemy stole as we started a couple weeks ago what do you do when satan has stolen your hope what do you do when hope is lost you maybe you used to have hope but now you're not sure you're not sure what happened and where did it go hope is a complicated thing and it's very easy to lose every single day if you turn on the news you will see evidence of evil in the world evidence of real spiritual forces creating destruction and destroying hope it is so constant and pervasive that is often the only thing we hear about and it seems like it's being strategically planned and orchestrated by some force and that's because it is being orchestrated there's a puppet master and it's not god when you if it ever in your life you have walked in the ways of unrighteousness or you've turned down the alleys of wickedness or when you've chosen to follow the voice of the masses you have learned that there is a force trying to lead you to destruction and you must recognize that there is a pattern that you can objectively see in that for century after century after century a common wicked hand has been leading humans into destruction killing stealing and destroying property prosperity lives families dreams and hopes jesus calls the orchestrator out by name he calls him satan and satan brings destruction wherever he goes if you just take a moment today and do a quick evaluation of your life there that's enough time probably the uh it and if you look quickly back at the last 20 years of your life and it looks like you basically have left a trail of tears emotional litter and a burned out forest of a life that probably means the enemy has been at work in your life trying to steal kill and destroy and that is a very common experience i don't know if you've seen these california wildfires that happen every single year california wildfires i mean they they i don't even know after how they have forests left but they've had so many fires out there but they seem to destroy everything in their path no matter what they it just destroys it there's two things that have to come together to put these massive fires out first it takes massive human effort specialty trained firemen from around the world with special equipment hundreds of thousands of man and woman hours hundreds of millions of dollars then it also takes the weather either a change in temperature or humidity or wind or rain has to change and then they can put them out together well putting out spiritual fires and that are bringing destruction putting those things out bringing them to an end usually require two forces as well it takes personal effort but if the only thing you do to try to put out those fires is personal effort you will constantly fail it also requires god's intervention personal effort in god's intervention those are how we deal with putting out those fires now when you give your life to jesus when you say to god god i give you control of my life i surrender to you i surrender myself to you those are just words until you actually follow through with that and when your words and your actions come into alignment that is when god begins to lead you besides still waters and restore your soul that is the heart of surrender there is no such thing as surrendering to god without giving him more and more and more control of you i know a handful of things one of the things i know is this jesus still changes people's lives i get to kind of be on the front row of life of watching people's lives be changed by jesus and i get to tell other people about how lives are being changed by jesus right here in lynn in revere and when other people hear that that god has not forgotten about lynn and revere that god has not forgotten about you it gives them hope for their life as well maybe god hasn't forgotten about them either it is so awesome to recognize what god is doing amongst us at east coast international church in lynn and revere so much so that sometimes i feel bad for marblehead and swampscott and salem and the hunt for real i do i i know god's up to something there but i wonder what it is and then i start to wonder what our role is supposed to be in that and those are real prayers of that mine us to hebrews chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11 verse 1. it says faith somebody say faith faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen it gives us assurance about things we cannot see verse six it is possible impossible to please god without faith anyone who wants to come to him must believe that god exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him so a question for us to wrestle with today is what does faith actually look like in the battle of life in this in this battle zone that we call the world what does faith actually look like well in this passage in hebrews it was written to encourage the faith of the people at the time and us as well it turns out that their faith is being challenged they are struggling the enemy has stolen things from them they are being persecuted for their faith even to the point of death hebrews 10 32 says this to them think back on the early days when you first learned about christ remember how you remained faithful even though it meant terrible suffering it's a call to remember what god has done for you verse 39 but we are not like those who turn away from god to their own destruction we are the faithful ones whose souls will be saved this is a call hebrews is a call to not give up it's a call not to give up it's a call not to pick up it's a call not to lean into the despair even though things might get difficult it's a call to persevere to hold on even when you feel like letting go hold on anyhow sometimes in this waiting process it's very very easy to go back to what you used to do when things get hard when things get difficult it's easy to go back to who you used to be we default we have these default mechanisms and we're not paying attention you default back to your street thinking you begin to trust your feelings more than you trust your faith we revert to unhealthy patterns to try to cover up the discomfort that we then have that's the real challenge that we all face every single one of us there was a man named peter peter was a future leader of the jesus movement that we're part of today peter had a moment of confusion a moment of struggle with this faith that was rather significant it's one of the leaders of the jesus movement he denied jesus that seems like a problem and it was he knew it was a problem he was ashamed and he went back to his old life in john chapter 21 jesus finds peter he finds peter fishing for fish instead of fishing for people why is that a big deal because jesus had asked peter and giving him the opportunity to fish for people instead of for fish and when he denied jesus he went back to his old way happened what did he do he had a moment of failure doubt and the enemies stole his faith from him and he went back to fishing for those fish because that's what he knew that's what he knew how to do that's what worked for him in the past and somebody needs to somebody today needs to listen to this whether in person or online maybe you have some skill sets or opportunities from your past or even your present that are not actually what god has instructed you to do or to be it may be profitable it may be convenient you may even perceive it as urgent or necessary but you need to burn it to the ground all the way to the ground so you can't even go back to it because it's not there anymore just let it sink in what does that mean maybe your marriage hasn't turned out the way you had planned maybe your kids picked up some of your brokenness and now struggle with some of it on their own those are hard things it's in those moments that we still must persevere because when you walk by faith you walk into the arena of the unknown and in that arena of faith all things are possible all things are possible when you burn it all down and step into that arena that's where miracles happen hebrews 11 1 faith is the confidence that what we have hoped for will actually happen it gives us assurance about the things we cannot see faith here is present tense hope is the future our faith now hope for the future what is faith well you you already understand faith on some level when you get into a car you have faith that you put gas in it and it will start right you have some kind of faith you're hoping when you get onto a plane and you let somebody fly you that you have never met and have no idea about their qualifications or credentials that's called faith faith is an interesting gift that we are given by god and in the spiritual realm faith is a gift that god gives you and you need to unwrap that gift and you need to activate that gift for some of you your faith has been dormant for a long time you might still consider yourself a person of faith a follower of jesus but you've been stuck you've been stuck to a place where maybe fear has crept in and crippled you maybe you're just not using your faith and so if you're looking closely at your life that would be why you were operating by fear and not by faith that's why you don't have the hope that perhaps you once had faith is the thing that activates hope it's like lighting a lighting a candle lighting a fire if you're gonna light a fire you need oxygen for that fire to exist without oxygen if there's no oxygen if there is no oxygen in this room i cannot light a fire you would also all be dead faith is the oxygen to the fire of hope you need that oxygen because hope always follows faith no oxygen no fire no faith no hope now when you're in a situation when faith steps in and says you're gonna make it when you're in a situation that you can't possibly make it when you're in your situation whether it's absolutely impossible there is no hope faith says there is hope faith says that there is nothing impossible with god that's what the author is telling people here in hebrews don't give up don't slip back don't fall into the old patterns of your life don't follow fall into patterns of ridiculous thinking and then he jumps ahead and reminds people of just how great god is by rehearsing with them the stories of people that have experienced great miracles in spite of betrayal in spite of tragedy in spite of disappointment and challenges these are people that made it through and did great things and held on to their hopes and dreams the author of hebrews tells about joseph and the many miracles that took place because of joseph even though he had once been greatly betrayed the story of moses in the wilderness and on and on the stories go but the idea is this there are people that have come before us that have already been through the fire of life and they still had hope because they did not surrender their faith when doctors speak of hope they understand that many patients die because they lose hope my hope does not come from doctors my hope does not come from lawyers my hope does not come from the government ever it comes from what god says it comes from what the scripture says that he will never leave you or forsake you and when you call on his name he will answer that's where my hope comes from when you have a little faith you need to develop that faith little by little you need to develop that faith and allow it to get stronger you need to treat faith like a muscle that you're trying to develop and get healthy we know this that if you don't exercise you get unhealthy sorry but it's true if you don't exercise your faith you get unhealthy as well and sluggish there's a sequence to this faith then hope then assurance and sometimes we lose things in the middle during the journey it has a way of getting hard louis and i went hiking this week we hiked mount madison eight miles four hours up i mean four miles up and it's painful and horrible it's like the worst thing i do you know you're just hiking up these mountains that's awesome stacy asked me why we do this i said so we can tell stories afterwards so but the uh but there's this moment in a hike you're like three miles in and everything in your body is burning and oxygen is depleting you start to make excuses like that's just a bad hiking day i just really can't finish today or you're thinking things like oh the oxygen is thin up here that's why that's why my cardio isn't good right the uh so uh the uh so you're just doing this thing you're like three miles ah we're almost there it's good enough it's good enough it's only a mile away from the top but it's the hardest smile you start to think maybe i should just turn back now all these things just go through your head right it's going through your head and then if you keep taking the next step forward next step forward you're now you're three or three and a quarter miles three and a half miles and you're like oh i should i can turn back now it's fine but then you could see the top you can see the top of the mountain it's like half a mile away then it turns out it's really not the top of the mountain it's a false summit and it's like and you're like oh then you get to the fall summit and there's like another peak but you're pretending like it's the real top but now you know it's really just another false summit as well and so there's three or four of these things it's horrible by the way when this happens the whole time you're fighting this desire to turn back to turn back to turn back but the reality is you're almost there it's like when you're almost there there's this moment right before you're there we like i could still turn back and not get there that happens to a lot of us in our journey of faith it starts to get hard right before the top and we turn back before we get there you might just be a moment away from assurance from seeing the hand of god intervene the pressure the suffering criticism gets to be too much but that assurance is right there the evidence is right there when you walk by faith god honors you and god blesses you when you walk by faith and hold on to hope it looks like this you find it in job chapter 23 job was a guy in the scripture that went through a whole bunch of very challenging situations and he's feeling a little lonely maybe god's abandoned him and he's looking for god and he says in verse 8 i go east he is not there i go west i cannot find him i do not see him in the north for he is hidden i look to the south but he is concealed verse 10. but he knows where i am going and when he tests me i will come out pure as gold for i have stayed on god's path i have followed his way and not turned aside i have not departed from his commands but have treasured his words more than daily food there's some intensity there even when he couldn't even when he couldn't hear god he was still all in because he was assured he had an assurance that god was for him and not against him an assurance that god did it once before and he could do it again and that's our assurance today that god did it before and he can still do it again now in this in this journey there's this moment like job experienced where it seems like there's some silence going on from god but silence does not mean absence it's often a faith-building moment when you're learning to ride a bike you know you're you're giving instructions or trying to figure out how to ride a bike when i would when the girls were younger would try to instruct the girls on on how to ride a bike and you would put training wheels on a bike and it's a tiny little bike and you work with them a few times and then eventually after they're used to that you take off the training wheels and you do this really horrible thing as a parent there's no training wheels you get them on the bike you're holding it and you push them off as you're running beside them you let go and you say nothing you're just silent because they must learn to implement the instructions they already have they don't need any more instruction in some things in life you've got to learn to ride through with the skills that god has already given you you don't need any more skills you already have enough to make it through that one god has a way of teaching us gradually so that we can become skilled as we mature you don't start on the tall bike you start on the small bike and it gives you the skills you need to step up where i learned to ride a bike it kind of isn't fair where i learned to ride a bike it was like corn fields there were no obstacles and no hills it was easy but in this city you got a whole lot of obstacles and a whole lot of hills it's very different and honestly it's much harder here to learn how to ride a bike but it doesn't matter that it's harder you still have to learn and if you're ever going to be successful you have to learn to succeed in your real environment you have to learn how to ride here not there it's an interesting lesson like but it's so hard yep it's hard for everybody not a single person it's not hard for there's not a single person that doesn't have baggage there's not a single person amongst us that's perfect now in the same vein of silence thinking about this there's this thing maybe you've heard of it or maybe you've heard them called the miranda rights the miranda rights are these things that happen when you get arrested you know this is a trigger alert so trigger warning here everybody you have the right to remain silent anything you can anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law you have the right to speak to an attorney to have an attorney present during any questioning if you cannot afford a lawyer one will be provided for you at government expense this is interesting you have the right to remain silent spiritually if the devil tries to arrest you you have the right to remain silent you also have a right later on to praise the devil down but that's a different thing you have the right to remain silent when it comes to falling into satan's traps you have the right to remain silent like don't complain you have the right to remain silent you don't have to complain you don't have to give the devil that foothold in your life you have the right to remain silent you don't have to speak in a hopeless manner you have the right to remain silent so the devil can't use that against you you can remain silent so the devil can't take your words and beat you with them you have the right to remain silent as the worship team comes back up when the devil starts planting things in your mind now pay attention to this when the devil starts putting things in your mind guess what you don't actually have to say those things out loud or on facebook like if you if you're past a sentence on facebook just delete delete if you're frustrated when you start writing just delete it just because it's in your brain doesn't mean it has to come out there's a major major milestone in maturity it is learning to not say all the things you think [Music] guess what not all the things you think are okay many of the things if not most of the things if not all the things we think are wrong we've got to test everything against the word of god [Music] if i just stood up here and said only the things i think it would be very problematic it's why i spend a lot of time scripting out my messages and then editing them and deleting things let go thank you for showing me that jesus that was incorrect [Music] job19 job once again says but as for me i know that my redeemer lives no matter what i'm going through faith is the foundation that hope stands on but if your foundation of faith is cracked your hope will fail hope will follow faith and then assurance will come maybe maybe you're a single mom and you're thinking to yourself over and over again the devil's just speaking things into your life that no one will ever love you or maybe you're thinking i'm running out of time will i always be alone or maybe you're a student and you're saying am i i'm never going to be any good at school never going to amount to anything or sometimes when people start to age a little bit they'll think things like say things like i'm getting so old and then we start to do dumb things like we're old you give yourself permission to believe things so that satan can play havoc with you because you've now said things that now you're starting to believe that aren't true so you have the right to remain silent listen here's a few here's something that i know i know that in my journey of life i will suffer but i know that my redeemer lives i recognize that i live in a fallen and broken and chaotic world and that satan is stealing and destroying and killing things and people yet i am committed to taking back what the enemy has stolen from me and i am committed to helping you take back what the enemy has stolen from you and by faith i have hope and assurance that in the end my redeemer jesus will stand victorious and i will stand with him and i have faith and hope and assurance that my redeemer lives and that in the end we will all together stand with jesus as well amen amen would you stand with me as we close today [Applause] amen go ahead and stand friends today in order to take back as we're on this journey in order to continue to take back what the enemy has stolen you need to exercise the faith that you already have so that it can be strengthened but maybe faith is new to you today maybe this isn't part of your story maybe it hasn't been part of your journey to this point well maybe today is an opportunity for you to take your first step on a journey of faith by calling out to jesus inviting jesus to forgive you of your sins to lead your life surrendering control of yourself to god none of that's easy by the way but it's a starting point in your own words in your own way you tell that to god as the worship team leads us in a song the altars are open let's respond to god where he's speaking to us today and how you can take your next step on this faith

impacted by that and if you have family or friends that you should reach out to don't forget to do so today about that a few things that i want to take care of before we get started here as you turn all your phones off the uh um a few things just to get uh first off i want to say thank you to pastor jesse for last sunday great job pastor jesse the uh and a few other things just kind of the fall the end of summer or fall we have a lot of things coming online for those of you that are relatively new here we still have been kind of functioning in um late pandemic mode as a church and so now we're we're just going to pretend like the pandemic's not happening anymore uh as we just was from from a calendar perspective at least and kind of get back rolling in a full steam ahead so october 31st a lot of people call this halloween but on halloween we as a church do not curse the darkness we bring a light to it any kind of dark places and so we have a light tonight event that night that you can be part of at different homes throughout our cities as we just bring a love and safety to a lot of different places uh another thing on that same right before on that weekend october 29th and 30th it's a saturday sunday we are having a justice weekend here we are bringing in bishop walter harvey uh who you will get to know and love uh that weekend uh just gonna be a tremendous time for us to really uh pay attention to our fourth uh value here as a church bringing justice for the oppressed another thing that you need to be aware of is an october 8th that uh we are having a for husbands and wives and for future brides and grooms we are having like a church date night okay on october 8th it's going to be planned out it's going to be an exciting night uh somebody already said what about single people do we got to do everything yeah so we have to figure that out then something we've been talking about for a little bit is on thursday evening september 22nd at 6 pm is the official launch of dinner church over in revere at a revere location so so this will function like as another service okay but it won't be like this service it'll be very very different it'll be around tables over dinner uh and for people that like this kind of bigger scenario doesn't really work for this will be a great opportunity for them to be introduced and connect with jesus in that different environment and so it's going to be church but it'll be very different uh than what you see here today and that's at the revere location and the next sunday is back to church sunday so this is kind of the line in the sand day where everybody's like okay it's time to stop going on vacation and pretending like i'm watching church online you know it's uh it's it's really everybody's back and so come on back everybody bring somebody to church with you next week and can i just encourage you when you post like hey come to church with me on sunday on an open facebook invite nobody's paying attention to that the uh just go invite a human to church like human to human like a bring him bring him with you kind of thing so please please do that um a couple years ago we started a series uh in the book of exodus where we started in exodus chapter one verse one and we just go on verse by verse chapter by chapter all the way through exodus about 6 000 sermons later um you know we did a lot of sermons on that but there's still two left okay we're going to knock one out this week and next week and and then we can then you'll really have exodus and we'll have a whole package you can just watch the whole thing online you can just spend days and days watching you know dozens and dozens of sermons if you want the so here we go the people of god had left their egyptian slavery and had been out in the desert for a few months wrestling with their new freedom if you didn't know this freedom isn't as easy as it sounds you gotta wrestle with your freedom you got to stay free they were not always successful with it however so god gives them a path to success a plan we call it the law or the ten commandments the rules and regulations for how to live and act in this new and emerging nation that god is trying to create with them now while their leader whose name is moses is getting all the details together from god at the top of a mountain the people while moses is the way the might start to play okay they immediately revert to the old ways of thinking and acting and they begin to worship a golden calf that they somehow managed to create in the brief period while moses was gone this is the story exodus chapter 32 verse 3 all the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to aaron then aaron took the gold melted it down and molded it into the shape of a calf when the people saw it they exclaimed oh israel these the calf these are the gods who brought you out of the land of egypt what they know who brought them out of egypt and now they're saying it was this guy this golden calf these people who have been rescued from egyptian slavery who have seen the mighty acts of god and defeating the false demon gods of egypt they walk through the same through the sea on dry land they watch the same sea wipe out an entire army they've had manna from heaven and quail that god sent water from a rock and healing from snakes and somehow in just a moment they are once again led astray apparently by wicked and by their wicked and rebellious hearts and by some people in their midst because not everybody in the crowd is always a true believer some were in the crowd for a different reason certainly satan had some disruptors amongst them wolves and sheep's clothing and they managed to succeed in distracting the people verse five aaron saw how excited the people were so he built an altar in front of the calf then he announced tomorrow will be a festival to the lord the people got up early the next morning to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings so you don't lose it in front of the golden calf in front of the false god the graven image after this they celebrated with feasting and drinking and they indulged somebody say indulged they indulged in pagan revelry it's a very descriptive phrase pagan revelry so now we friends we got ourselves a situation they create an image an idol of a false god apparently one that they like a lot one that they can worship one that will let them make the rules to simply do whatever they want however they want doesn't that sound similar [Music] to america today we go around creating our own new religious systems that accommodate our own unique preferences or sins or attitudes it is fundamentally our version of creating a golden calf a false god to worship because we were all born to worship we were all created every body that has been created was created to worship so we will worship someone or something it is who we are in our core we are worshipers it may be the one true living god or it may be ourselves that we worship it may be money that we worship it may be the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eyes or the pride of life that we worship but we will worship something so when i read this passage it's hard for me not to superimpose this sounds like usa 2022. see they change gods they immediately revert to bad living or what's called pagan revelry and although they had been slaves for some time amongst egypt clearly some of them had become part of this pagan egyptian religious system they indulged in pagan revelry and i believe in our modern times and in our everyday life there is a direct correlation where people are aggressively trying to establish new religious systems or radical and unfounded reinterpretations of orthodox biblical understanding but what these people do is they give us a tell a tale is a clue to what a person's true intent is that someone is trying to hide and here's the three tells that i see the tells that i see when people are doing this is it's a quest for ungodly power a quest for ungodly privilege or a desire to indulge in pagan revelry those are the tells when people do this so when the people gathered they were clearly led by some group of people and this was in effect a national rebellion against the rule and reign of god in their midst the people had marched out of egypt but clearly egypt had not yet marched out of them and i want you to know this today god may have set you free here today but until you have evicted those things he set you free from out of your heart you are still at risk so evict those things out of your heart evicted egypt out of your heart so god when when this is all on on moses comes back down and all this is discovered god responds decisively to this abomination and he wipes out three thousand people and moses then pleads with god to spare the lives of everybody else now jump ahead next chapter chapter 33 and we find that god has not yet given up on his people that's good news if you read the text carefully you can kind of tell that god might still be a little angry with them there seems to be a little attitude in there but but but he still loves them and he's still got got some stuff for him so exodus chapter 33 then the lord said to moses get going somebody said get going get going you and the people you brought up out of the land of egypt this is the part that i think is a little attitudey he doesn't say get going you and my people say get going you and those people that you brought up out so just go up to the land i swore to give to abraham isaac and jacob i told him i will give this land to your descendants and i will send an angel before you to drive out the canaanites amorites hittites parasites jebusites go up to this land that flows with milk and honey so get going tell your neighbor get going i mean you can stay in church right now but but hold on for this okay get going what's going on here get going is god saying hey it's time to leave this past behind get going get going you get going you and your family so if you're here today there is something today that you might need to leave behind you might need to leave something behind in order to embrace the promise that god has for you but you will not be able to embrace the promise unless you leave something else behind because in order to go you have to leave leave this place well that's exactly how another translation of the same passage says it says that the lord said to moses leave this place one says get going one says leave this place that's because in order to do one you got to do the other two things you have to leave and you have to go you need to leave behind the sin you need to leave behind the rebellion you need to leave behind the entrapments of this world you need to leave behind the doubt you need to leave behind the confusion you need to leave behind life's disappointments and you need to go toward the promises of god you go towards freedom you go to obedience and you go to victory and you go to faith and you go to confidence and you go towards your purpose that god has for you so what do you need to leave behind today if i asked you if i passed out notebooks today at pens and i said hey would everybody just write down everything that you need to leave behind you all know what you need to leave behind i mean most of you could fill up notebooks and notebooks with all the things you just need to leave behind all the things you need to leave all the things you need to walk away from because we know we know we wrestle with it we struggle with it we know the challenge is not usually in knowing what you need to leave behind it's in knowing where you're supposed to go anybody want to know where they should go i know where you should go i'm going to tell you where to go right now the first service didn't get that joke the uh this is the other this is the naughty service right so so um here's do you know where you need to go you need to get going to the promised land you need to go to your promise get going you that means to the promises that god has for you where do you need to go you need to go to the promise because his promises were true yesterday they are true today and they are true tomorrow so get going you get going to the promised land because that's exactly where you can go to the promised land so in the promised land i want you to catch this the text says go up to the land i swore to give abraham isaac and jacob god declares in that promise that he had made previously and in this moment god declares that he is going to give them a place a place to live a land and god in this moment declares that he is honoring his covenant his promise honoring his promise even though this is again he's saying this immediately after the people abandoned him even though the people dishonored god here we find out that god will never dishonor himself you may dishonor god god will not dishonor himself that's why it is so important for us today to recognize what the true character of god is because if you do not know the true character of god you will not understand his goodness you will not understand his grace you will not understand that god is for you and not against you if you think that god is opposing you if you think that god is out to get you if you think that god wants to crush you if you think that god wants to send you straight to hell you completely misunderstand the character of god and when you hear about the promises of god they cannot possibly apply to you if that's who you think god is because we all have failed and we have all dishonored ourselves and we have dishonored god but god's character will not permit him to dishonor himself so when god promises something that he will do he will do it when god promises satan god made a promise to satan that someday he would come and crush his head it was just a matter of time it wasn't if god was going to do it it was when god was going to do it so when god promised abraham isaac jacob a promised land it wasn't if god would come through it's when god would come through because when god makes a promise he honors his promise this is hard for us to get our head around because our thinking and god's promises are very far apart from each other in our thinking we say i can't do it but god says you can do all things through christ we say i'm too tired god says come to me i'll give you rest we say i i'm always worried and frustrated god says cast all your cares on me we say i can't go on but god says i will direct your steps we say i'm not able god says i am able we say i'm not worth it god says it will be worth it we say i can't manage but god says i will supply all your needs we say i'm afraid god says i've not given you a spirit of fear we say i don't have enough faith god says i've given everyone a measure of faith we say i'm not smart enough god says i'll give you wisdom we say i feel all alone god says i will never leave you or forsake you ever those are promises of god his promises about what he will do that's the promise that we're talking about today the promises that god says he will do certainly god still speaks to people today which is why it is so critically important that you understand that when you hear god speak to you or think it's god speaking to you that you must fully confirm that with the word of god because the word of god will tell you if it's true for example if you're a 28 year old single female and you think that the lord is promising you that he is sending you a very specific type of wealthy tech mogul handsome man i'm not saying it's wrong but you need to make sure that the bible actually confirms that this is one of god's promises i mean i've been waiting for that red dodge viper for a couple of years now i can't find it in the bible anywhere though i'm looking there is definitely a difference between a promise of god and the leading of god i'm going to try to help you understand this today the promise of god is something that he says he declares he will do it is irrevocable is what he will do the leading of god is something different the leading of god is us responding to the purposes of god in the world for example god may be inviting you into his plans to destroy the works of satan and set captives free he is inviting you to do that those plans though are still dependent on the free will choice of other free will agents that may choose not to follow god's leading for example you might choose not to participate that's not what god wants but you might choose that not to that is not god failing it is most often simply someone not responding to god's leading which is why we must make sure that we understand why we do what we do there's this expression that my dad used to say he would say right is its own reward meaning you do right because it's the right thing to do not because of the outcome we do write whether the outcome is what we hope for or not because god is at work and sometimes people don't do what god would like them to do maybe you notice that in life for example so much of the old testament is about that very thing about israelites not doing what god wants them to do god is intentionally trying to create a nation that will be a city on a hill a beacon of hope a nation that will be the greatest blessing to the entire world that's what he wants to do with israel and yet they frequently decide to be self-indulgent pagan instead that seems like an unfortunate compromise yet in spite of all of their failings and in spite of all of your failings in spite of all my failings god still honors every single one of his promises because it's not about who i am it's about who god is in isaiah chapter 55 there's an interesting moment here in verse 11 god says it's the same with my word so the word of god i send it out and it always produces fruit it will accomplish all i want it to and it will prosper everywhere i send it so god's word goes out it bears fruit it accomplishes purposes so that's what you see here's an example of this this story on november 20 1839 there were two missionaries named john williams and james harris who went to the new hebrides islands now called vanuatu both of these missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals on the island on that november 20th day only a few minutes after having arrived on shore imagine one leader said thus were the new hebrides baptized with the blood of martyrs and christ thereby told the whole christian world that he claimed these islands now as his own and so a few years later in 1848 another man tried uh to go to this island again his name was john getty he wasn't much to look at he was just a willing and fully committed servant of god so he heads to the islands he successfully arrives he's on shore and he is not immediately killed and eaten that's a success he then proceeds to learn the language of the people he then proceeds to take this language and translate the word of god into their language he was there for 24 years working with these people on this one particular island 24 years later he left and they put a memorial tablet on the island and it says in memory of john getty born in scotland 1815 minister in prince edward island seven years missionary from nova scotia for 24 years when he landed in 1848 there were no christians here when he left in 1872 there were no heathens that's a significant accomplishment but it's a it's a fulfillment of the promise it's a promise fulfilled of what god said about his word that his word produces fruit word produces fruit so a question for you to wrestle with today what promise is god taking you to what promise is god taking you to and as you are coming to terms with his promise in your life get going go get it leave behind and go to the promise that's what you're called to do now watch how god instructs them on how he's going to take care of this promise it's a little bit twist here in the story he says i will send an angel somebody say angel so god's going to send an angel before you to drive out the enemies so the canaanites the amorites hittites parasites jebusites go up to the land that flows with milk and honey so an angel this is god's plan god's plan is that he will arrange for the current unlawful tenants of the promised land to be evicted by an angel that's the plan that's god's plan as the worship team comes up the promised land you see was not possible for the israelites to take they had no idea how to take the promised land because they were not a military force but rather israel was just at this time a rather large group of wandering nomads with paganish tendencies they were not a military force and no other military force would be remotely afraid of these people under normal circumstances god knew this so did the israelites so when god says i'm going to give you the promised land now he makes it clear that if they do what he says and go where he says that he will take care of executing on the promise that he will get them the promise now this is a different part of the promise the first part is what god says he will definitely do like he's going to give the promised land the second part is how he's going to execute it this part is a little bit conditional you do the obeying and i'll do the delivery you follow i will deliver you follow i will deliver you obey i will deliver you obey i will deliver that works for us today too you do the obeying and god will do the delivering [Music] see this god delivered daniel out of the lion's den to deliver joseph out of the prison israel out of egypt humanity out of endless captivity in our pursuit of god and his promises we must learn to let god go before us to work it out instead of trying to work it all out on our own we just do the obeying and let god do the delivering you do the obeying god does the delivering all the way to the promised land would you stand with me as we close today [Music] wherever you're at with this today listen god has a promise for you whether that be your promised land or a promise that's a little different than that you need to hear this today it's time to get going get going leave whatever behind that you need to leave and go get the promise go get the promise and by the way you're not making it happen god is making it happen you do the obeying god will do the delivery as the worship team leads let's respond to that today if there's something that you need to leave behind or go towards the altars are open let's spend some time praying today let's pray this through", "so what that means is that Father's Day is coming so that's next Sunday is Father's day our pig roast and ax throwing outside roasting pigs so it's like but I want to make sure you know this in Psalms chapter 68 it says God is a father to the fatherless and if your father wasn't the father that he should have been then let God be your father and next Sunday let's celebrate that so come next week regular service times 9 45 and 11 slightly very slightly abbreviated services with a lot of fellowship and fun and connection afterwards and if you come to the second service it'll just smell like bacon in here the whole time so um so that's either good or bad depending I suppose the uh Wednesday nights we're pivoting on our uh Wednesday nights right now we are Wednesday nights is about discipleship family discipleship so we have children's programming and youth programming upstairs we have adult programming downstairs and right now we're going through a series on the Holy Spirit uh it's very good and so I'd encourage you to come on out for that last week we started our Bible engagement goal for the month on what we're encouraging you to do is to watch The Chosen TV series and then connect with what the Bible verses are in that so you're not passively watching it you're actively watching it and so this week we have season two Bible connections there for you that you can pick up on your way out of the service uh today now the Bible's basically broken up into two main parts the first part and the second part the the Old Testament in the New Testament it's commonly called and in the Old Testament there are three major types of leaders in this uh Hebrew Bible it's the prophets the priests and the Kings three major types of leaders and so when you're reading through it you'll see these categories pop up then Jesus shows up and throughout the New Testament uh he we find Jesus fulfilling those roles of the three uh roles of prophet priest and King another moment in history Israel was in trouble and Jesus had come to save them to rescue them and Jesus was now functioning as a prophet like a prophetic voice to his own people okay again he's bouncing between these three roles in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 47 to 51 we find a teaching of Jesus that is one of the more complicated teachings of Jesus you will find anywhere in the New Testament it says this Jesus goes again the Kingdom of Heaven somebody say Kingdom of Heaven so Jesus talked trying to explain what the Kingdom of Heaven is like is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind what kind of fish did it catch every kind when the net was full they drag it up onto the shore sat down sorted the good fish into the crates but threw the bad ones away that is the way it will be at the end of the world the angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth do you understand these things yes they said we do so throughout Matthew chapter 13 you have a grouping of several teachings of Jesus I think there's seven there and Jesus is using relevant and contemporary metaphors and illustrations trying to explain as best as it can what the Kingdom of Heaven is going to be like what it is like now the spiritual leaders and the people of the day had a very specific type of understanding of what the Empire of God would be like what the kingdom of God would be basically this is what they thought they thought that basically they were a pro oppressed by the Empire of Rome the ancient Roman Empire and now these people want to take political control over the Empire it actually sounds familiar to me they could have they wanted to do this so they could have their own Jewish Empire Jesus was so popular in this region that they were all hoping that this is the guy that's going to rescue us from Rome he's gonna they were hoping that Jesus would establish a new Empire a new kingdom they would either overthrow the Roman Empire or somehow remove the Roman Empire from their land think of this moment like an ancient political rally an ancient political campaign rally except the person that they think is a candidate isn't running for office so there's a real misunderstanding on the part of the people about what's Happening Here so Jesus is very intently trying to explain what his kingdom is and what it's not and the truth is the people are having a hard time understanding that their spiritual traditions and understandings do not in fact line up with what Jesus is saying the kingdom of God is like it's complicated for them to get this so they've had a certain way of thinking for a long time and Jesus is disrupting this thinking and saying I know that's what you think you're wrong this is what it's like nobody likes to be told they're wrong and this is what Jesus is doing very sensitively very carefully and sometimes very directly in fact Jesus teaches with these illustrations in order to call forward those that are finally ready to hear and to understand those that were ready could find new life and those that were not ready would walk away still perplexed wondering what fish he was talking about and still there were others that understood what Jesus was saying and rejected it as false or dangerous or impossible Jesus again is functioning like a prophetic voice to his own people warning them like a big danger sign warning danger danger danger danger stop yield yield construction ahead wrong way one way whatever the signs are Jesus is giving all of these signs to the people I do wonder sometimes about those signs in Lynn I wonder was it really necessary for all of those stop signs to be here you know I wonder sometimes if we need so many one-way streets or not enough one-way streets or sometimes it's just you can tell the city wasn't planned from the beginning all right you you get this idea you got all these signs but the signs are there for a reason I hope but with Jesus the warning signs are always there for a reason there's no confusion in Jesus's uh understanding have you ever asked yourself this question but why does Jesus care if I sin maybe you maybe you're more spiritual than me but I've asked that question why does Jesus care if I sin so what if I'm wicked what does it matter to Jesus he's Jesus well the reason it matters is because Jesus loves you and he knows the consequences of what happens outside of his kingdom both in the present and in the future he understands what the kingdom of this world leads to and so he wants us to be part of his kingdom simply because he loves us in verse 49 we get one of the more challenging teachings of Jesus that is the way it will be at the end of the world the angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth so the wicked will be judged which is bad for the wicked but great for justice and that's a whole other sermon the concept of justice and hell and why it's so important they will be thrown into the fiery furnace I want you to get this today Jesus talks about hell more than any other person in the Bible why because in the kingdom of God there isn't hell you don't have hell hell only exists for those outside the kingdom inside no problem outside big problem Jesus is clearly concerned that his people watch this he's concerned that his people the Jewish people are outside his kingdom and they need to be rescued because many of them are in the wrong Kingdom now you have to understand this this would have been a scandalous accusation Jesus is speaking to a group of Jewish people saying you're in the wrong Kingdom scandalous accusation but this is an act of Love on the part of Jesus Jesus would declare this to people as a warning sign hey I understand you're my people but you don't quite get it right on this one so he's re he's helping them to truly understand God's perspective of the Kingdom of Heaven now if somebody were outside tomorrow on the sidewalk passing out pamphlets warning people about the dangers of of heroin and Fentanyl and alcoholism nobody would think that that person was hateful people like oh that's nice trying to keep kids off drugs you know whatever it is or if you were standing down in Louisiana near the edge of an alligator-infested Creek kindly and patiently and graciously letting people know that they will get eaten by alligators and will die a painful and unpleasant death if they decide to go swimming in this Creek now nobody would think you are a hateful person they might think you a little strange but not hateful now this is really the attitude that Jesus has in his teachings on the kingdom he is expressing the reality of a place where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth explaining the dangers of what we understand him to be talking about as hell and then he's leading people away from it he's leading them in another Direction because Jesus is always opposed to people living underneath the Dominion and Rule of Satan he will literally Jesus will literally fight for you until your last breath because he doesn't want people to live in Earthly or Eternal captivity now many people are uncomfortable with this and they will try to reimagine or reinvent or dismiss or set aside the Eternal realities that Jesus clearly and plainly teaches they don't want to believe in hell and honestly I understand that it's hard to accept a black and white reality when we live in such a gray world it's hard to reorient your life and thinking when you have lived underneath the illegitimate Rule and control of Satan for your whole life so changing my life changing my words changing my thoughts seems nearly impossible to do so it is easy to Simply accept any other thought that eases the conflict in your mind or Spirit about the things the hard things that Jesus says but Jesus wants us to think about eternity he talked about eternity often in fact the Bible is very quiet on the subject of Hell except in the words of Jesus this makes sense because we would expect that the one who came from eternity would know and talk about eternity more than anybody else so whenever you are confronted with thoughts that uh are coming from a different place than where Jesus is coming from I want you to notice the differences between the thoughts of the kingdom of this world and the thoughts of the kingdom of Jesus things like well you can't ever let yourself be disrespected but Jesus said love your enemy and turn the other cheek very different thoughts very very very different thoughts or the kingdom of this world might say whatever works for you but Jesus said I'm the only way so it doesn't matter what works for you I'm the only way very different thoughts Kingdom of this world kingdom of God Jesus said lots of stuff that was very difficult sometimes people will come up with these little little booklets these little pamphlets like say they could be like encouraging words from Jesus this passage was left out because this is not one of those things that people perceive as encouraging like whoa that's a hard saying of Jesus there's other little pamphlets that say hard sayings of Jesus this is one of them well Jesus said lots of things that are pretty difficult and intentional and over the top to get your attention for example in Luke chapter 14 Jesus said something pretty outrageous a large crowd was following Jesus he turned around and said to them if you want to be my disciple you must by comparison hate everyone else Jesus said that your father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes even your own life otherwise you cannot be my disciple and if you do not carry your own cross and follow me you cannot be my disciple that's that falls under hard stuff Jesus said Jesus of course is speaking hyperbolically when when he says to hate our parents and family sits everywhere else he commands us to love everybody and to then somehow indiscriminately hate your mother and father would not make any sense he's going over the top on purpose declaring to us that no matter what your allegiances are in life there is no Allegiance more important than your allegiance to Jesus and when we pledge our allegiance to Jesus we could pledge our complete and total allegiance to Christ first and we are pledging to follow his example that's that's what's going on there so hard stuff Jesus says so Jesus said it we need to pay attention to it and we need to understand there are different kinds of Kingdoms in verse 47 it says something that to us is not hard we love this part or should but it may not have been super encouraging to the people that heard it verse 47 says again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind like I don't see how that's encouraging it's because you're the fish of every kind so this fit this net that's being thrown over the boats there's two boats okay floating along and they throw a net to each other and one has one side one has the other and there's a floaty things on top and there's some weights on the other end of the net that sink it all the way to the bottom and then just they just drag the net across the water and around along the bottom and it catches all kinds of fish now in the sea of Godly at the time there were at least 20 different kinds of fish that were that were swimming around and this was actually a pretty easy way to fish and so they would go they would catch the fish and bring it to shore now this is really important to understand the faithful Jews and the cultural Jews were essentially under the impression that because they were God's chosen people that they were the exclusive owners of God's affection they had generally forgotten their mandate to be a light to the Gentiles meaning foreigners and immigrants to all people that weren't Jewish all of them they were chosen by God and they were they were chosen by God not for hoarding privilege but for Distributing God's blessing to the entire world Isaiah chapter 60 says this arise Jerusalem let your light shine for all to see for the glory of the Lord Rises to shine on you Darkness as black as night covers all the nations of the Earth but the glory of the Lord Rises and appears over you All Nations will come to your light Mighty Kings will come to see irradiance here we see that Israel was to be the bright hope the Beacon of Hope For The World the city on a hill that would that would be the standard for life and conduct and worship and they had stumbled along the way so Jesus in these teachings in Matthew 13 Jesus is calling his people back to the reality of his kingdom being for all people somebody said oh so so for all people Jews and gentiles them and everyone else that meant their neighbors to the north that they didn't like their neighbors to the South that they didn't like their neighbors to the east that they didn't like throughout the region and Beyond all of these teachings are happening in the Galilee region region and near Jesus's adult hometown of Capernaum now Capernaum watch this this is I think this is a fascinating part Capernaum was on the border which a border Community which separated the Jews from the Gentiles people from different ethnicities on one side and then the other but there was lots of trade going back and forth at the Border Town and so he kind of this interesting place where Jesus chose to land but there's more to it if you pay attention to the geography and trade routes of the Middle East you'll see on this map that there's a very interesting road that goes through Capernaum it's called via Maris so on top of that c that body of water the Sea of Galilee you'll see a community called Capernaum that red line is an ancient Highway an ancient trade route that goes and Cuts North right at Capernaum why does that matter this would become part of the ancient Roman highway system or trade routes sometimes called the Imperial Highway now when you think about trade routes today you're thinking tractor trailers and trains and planes and cargos ships and all that kind of stuff that wasn't the way back then trading Goods was slow and methodical and you would transport the goods and here's what would happen if you were down south of Israel and Egypt or Northern Africa you would cut through Israel on this road to go on your way to Asia to Mesopotamia to Greece to Italy all the different parts of the world where you wanted to trade your goods and people would go back and forth on this road where does this road cut through Capernaum this was a trading town this was a Border Town this was a trade route town which meant that literally people from all over the world would travel slowly back and forth through the exact place where Jesus was teaching this lesson this particular part of ancient Israel was an area of trade which means these people would have seen people from everywhere they would have talked to people from everywhere if they were in the trading business this is very different than where I grew up where I grew up everyone was the same you never saw anyone not the same there were no trade routes just Factory workers and Farmers everybody looked the same they dressed the same they talked the same they thought the same everything was the same so when I was 18 and came to Boston for the first time I did not know what to do the whole world was here a global Center of Commerce and trade everybody from everywhere and every language was here now Capernaum wasn't quite that extreme um because people weren't just living from all over the place but it was a place where people came through and the people that Jesus was talking to in this story in this illustration honestly despise those other people they despised the foreigners they certainly had no interest in establishing a relationship with them take their money and go or or of being particularly hospitable to them because they weren't one of God's chosen people turns out they were wrong about that Jesus is saying to these people his own people that in his kingdom all kinds of people are going to be drawn into his kingdom they will not be exclusive communities of Jewish Elites or pure Bloods but that his message would appeal and attract people from the entire planet but from every tribe and every nation in Revelation chapter 5 it says they sang a new song saying you are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were slain and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and Nations the message of Jesus is international that's why we put it in our name East Coast International Church [Applause] that's not because we want to be globally uh franchised or something it's because the message here we are an International Community we want to be an International Church so the message is for all in a verse 48 it says this when the net was full they dragged it up onto the shore sat down and sorted the good fish into the crates but through the bad ones away Jesus is using this very familiar fishing metaphor illustration to help people understand all kinds of fish people are going to be part of his kingdom but just because you're a tilapia or a mackerel doesn't automatically get you in the bad ones will get tossed out what me what this means is your ethnicity isn't a ticket into God's Kingdom your your fit your family heritage isn't what enters you into God's Kingdom your wealth doesn't buy you into God's Kingdom your difficult story of Oppression and Injustice and suffering is simply not enough to get in one thing alone your belief in Christ your decision to authentically choose Jesus and follow him in his kingdom is the exclusive and only way into his kingdom now remember who's who he's telling this to a group of people that very much thought their spiritual Heritage and their ethnicity made them part of God's Kingdom that's a radical shift in understanding many years ago when kylo was in elementary school we were walking in the linwoods and we're just talking and she goes dad I was kind of born a Christian well I said no kylo I actually said it much more aggressively than that like no no no no no no no no you were not born a Christian Kyla you were not born a Christian you were born a wicked-hearted sinner foreign tough living with me I know but you are only a follower of Christ because you choose to be a follower of Christ not because it's your spiritual ethnicity Jesus opened the doors of the Kingdom wide open for everyone but you got to choose whether you're going to be part of his kingdom or not as the worship team comes up here Jesus is talking to his people he's laying all on the line he stands in front he's warning them of impending danger warning of the improper condition of their hearts and their misunderstandings of the Kingdom warning of the fact that they desperately need to be rescued even though they don't think they need to be it's like that old story about a man who fell off a cliff but managed to grab a tree limb on the way down in the following conversation ensued he's like is anybody up there I am here I am the Lord Do You Believe Me Yes Lord I believe I really believe but I can't hang on much longer that's all right if you really believe you have nothing to worry about I will save you just let go of the branch a moment of pause then the old man says is anyone else up there that is the way that we are as humans we instinctively seem to understand and know we need God's Kingdom but when push comes to shove it can be difficult to trust God in these moments and that's that's really the point today to understand Jesus call to trust him and his leadership inside of his kingdom that his kingdom is going to be different and that we're invited in and that he will be our leader why don't you stand with me as we close [Music] so today that's that's the opportunity to respond [Music] where are you at in trusting God where are you at entrusting the call of Jesus to follow him to let him be your forgiver to let him be your leader foreign to let his kingdom be the kingdom that you reside Within in every aspect of your life the altars are open let's spend some time responding and praying today as the worship team leads us [Music]", "\n\n**3.12.19**\n\n**General Notes - Pastor

Grace is for right now according to Second Corinthians 12 9. in Hebrews 4 16 we are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of our gracious God to receive mercy and find Grace to help us in a time of need more literal translation of that last phrase would be grace for a well-timed help there is Grace for what we need when we need it now that is beautiful Grace not sooner not later Grace no more no less Grace perfectly timed and perfectly tailored like Corey ten Boone it is easy for us to let our minds run ahead of us causing a stampede of fear it is natural for us to wonder about tomorrow but God has promised strength for each day according to Deuteronomy 33 25. there is no Grace for tomorrow until tomorrow one of the secrets to successful living is living each day in the moment of God's sufficient and surprising Grace timing is everything even when it comes to God's grace end of article today I want to remind you that God loves you and the God wants to empower you to overcome every fear and he wants to offer you Grace for today this was a profound truth that impacted me in a very real way as I was getting ready to go on the plane after five years of not being able to fly I kept on reading this scripture over and over again I needed strength and I needed Supernatural courage that I didn't have and I decided to trust God and step out in faith and it wasn't easy and truthfully I was afraid every step of the way but I felt this incredible courage come upon me even as I was afraid because I knew that God was with me I pray that some of you today can identify with what I'm saying and realize that God wants to offer you that same courage to face your fear whatever it may be so as we close this week of prayer and fasting let me pray for you and let's invite God to enter these moments where we find ourselves facing Giants that seem overwhelming let us pray God we thank you for an awesome week of prayer and fasting of connection the community Fellowship of believing for your promises it is your promises that we want to receive but God it is you that we're after we want to be more like you I pray God that today you would encourage us as we face every giant that stands in our way God we believe in miracles we believe that every obstacle whether it's a sickness whether it's an emotional challenge whether it's a mental health need whatever it may be you're able to meet it and you're able to overcome and because of you we are able to overcome I pray for victory for every person that is listening to me right now and those that are praying in their homes those that are praying at the church those that are praying in their small groups victory for us as a church family God we thank you for being a deeply generous God we can't wait to see what you're going to do when we look back at what you've already done our hearts are full of gratitude we love you God and it is in Jesus mighty name that we pray amen thank you so much for your time it's been a pleasure being with you each and every morning praying together we'll see you again next time bye-bye", "all right we're continuing in our we're continuing in our act series and we've we're initially we started with acts 1 1 and we're moving through but we're also jumping ahead periodically for different stories in the future of Acts and then pulling it back and making the connection and so this is the third uh time that we've talked about uh Peter who is a little bit further here Acts chapter 9 verse 32 let's track with this meanwhile Peter traveled from place to place and he came down to visit the Believers in the town of Lita there he met a man named Aeneas who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years Peter said to him and he is Jesus Christ heals you who who's doing the healing there Jesus Christ get up and roll up your sleeping map and he was healed instantly then the whole population of Lita and Sharon saw Aeneas walking around and they turned to the Lord so that's the first part of the story second part there was a believer in Japan named Tabitha which in Greek is Dorcas she was also doing kind things for others and helping the poor somebody say kind things about this time she became ill and died her body was washed for burial and laid in an upstairs room but the Believers had heard that Peter was nearby Atlanta so they sent two men to beg him please come as soon as possible so Peter returned with them and as soon as he arrived they took him to the upstairs room the room was filled with widows who were weeping and showing him the coats and other clothes the Dorcas had made for them but Peter asked them all to leave the room then he knelt and prayed turning to the body he said get up Tabitha and she opened her eyes when she saw Peter she sat up he gave her his hand and helped her up then he called in the widows and all the Believers and he presented her to them alive the news spread through the whole town and many believed in the Lord and Peter stayed a long time in Joppa living with Simon a Tanner of hides okay great great story with Peter a great account of Peter and and these Miracles and there's like the first miracle and then the second miracle and in the first miracle it says Peter just simply said and yes Jesus Christ heals you get up uh and roll up your sleeping mat and he was healed instantly I want you to catch this that uh Nia's had to take an action step to really Embrace this whole healing in his life he's being asked to get up that means like taking your hope and your faith and you're just making an action plan for your life and you're just going for it you're just going to get out there and go he was now free from his paralyzation but he also has the freedom to choose so he has to decide if he's going to choose Freedom or not which is where the phrase roll up I think makes a lot of it uh it's a significant statement why does he tell Aeneas to roll up his mat well very simply it's because he's not going to need it anymore don't just leave trash lying around pick it up that would be a good sermon for Lynn right there right right you know so I'm saying right there so anti-litter Sunday come on let's go the uh yeah that's a distraction right there there there comes a moment though in your life when when you invite Jesus in when you respond to the call and healing of Jesus that your life is about to change but you have to decide if you're going to let it change for real like for real change meaning you get rid of the fallback plans there's no plan C there's no plan D it's burn the bridges it's all Jesus all the time nothing else [Applause] now in a story in an account the map represents his past obviously this is where he's been at for the last eight years on a sleeping mat the mat very much symbolizes his paralyzation and all the challenges that he's faced and sometimes you have to roll that up and get rid of it because in life we experience this all the time there are some things there are some people there are some attitudes there are some actions there's some philosophies that you simply have to get rid of if you're ever going to get up and walk in Freedom the way that Christ wants you to walk in Freedom what does that look like in everyday life I mean that might mean you shut down the Facebook and Instagram Pages it might mean that you have to change your social medias it might mean that you have to get a new phone with a new phone number and not transfer all of the old contacts because you know what it means when they call you it might mean when they figure out what your new number is that you find out who gave them your new number and delete that person too [Applause] I'm just being ornery now it might mean that you need to take a different way home because the way that you used to go home always got you in trouble it might mean that you need to go to different places because you know the places that you used to go there's people there to help you go the wrong direction they on they unroll that mat and lay it back down and encourage you to back into paralyzation when it comes to Jesus he invites everybody but when you come he invites you to lay down your whole life all of it all of who you have been all of who you have planned to be that's that's oh I thought Jesus was like me the way I was he loves you just like you are but he loves you too much to let you stay that way roll up your mat and become what he recreates you to be what this means for us is we've got to leave the cage of captivity in our past if you're ever going to walk in Freedom you have to walk away from the cage not too long ago I had a groundhog problem you see I have a little I've had a little Urban Garden for a few years in our backyard and you know tomatoes and cucumbers and eggplants and beans I don't even know why I grow those things I just like them I don't eat them but I was but I was mad that the groundhog was eating them okay groundhog come and you got like half tomatoes and half cucumbers and half eggplants and beans and just a hot mess out there in our garden finally I decide I'm going to get rid of that groundhog I got myself a cage trap you thought I was going to get a gun I did not get a gun I'm not a gun guy okay finally got the cage trap what's all those big traps so it's like luxurious so if the groundhog so he could he could get in and like have a nap and stuff and so I didn't feel bad about it so my it was Humane I wasn't gonna catch him like and be mean to him so I I I I was my plan was to catch him and to take him to the Lynn Woods that was my plan and to let it go I don't know if that's legal uh but but I was gonna so my plan was ready I had the cage I cut up an apple and some vegetables I threw it in the cage and set the Trap the next morning success well or so I thought so I thought turns out I'd captured a squirrel [Applause] it was a very scared squirrel a little crazy I mean this squirrel was just going around and around and around and around in a cage like trying to figure out a way out but he'd already done it five thousand times so I I'm like oh this is so mean so I rushed out I opened up the cage tried to release him I got the door open and for like 10 minutes I tried to convince the squirrel to leave the cage I don't know why I was trying to convince a squirrel to leave the cage but I was but he wouldn't go I turned the cage on his side I turned the cage upside down I tried everything I could to think of I would kick the cage I would scream I'd yell I'd I'd try to be nice but it wouldn't leave finally you know it's this crazy squirrel you know he's completely free he just has to leave the cage he has to leave it eventually I had to bribe the squirrel I had to bribe him out of the cage so I I set the cage up really nicely he's in it still running around and I made Apple and I put all the food outside the cage in a little line so he was then I walked away and sure enough the squirrel walks out of the cage I reset the Trap to get this stupid groundhog 30 minutes later I caught the same squirrel again it turns out I'm an awesome squirrel catcher that's that's like my gift I can catch squirrels like nobody's business I never did get that groundhog here's a problem this the squirrel is very representative of people Jesus set you free but you got to leave the cage the enemies out there and the story apparently I was the enemy um you know set in the cage to capture you don't go back in don't go back in get up roll up your mat means the old life is finally over now it's time for a new one so don't keep revisiting and knocking on the door of the old life when you read this passage in Acts it should sound remarkably familiar if you're familiar with the Bible at all the Miracles are similar even the words are similar there was a moment you see when Jesus had healed a man at the pool of Bethesda and said get up take up your mat and walk so Jesus had done a very similar thing and then there was another time there was another in a moment with a a moment with Jesus where Jesus spoke to a dead girl in Mark chapter 5 and said says this Jesus Took her by the hand and said to her talitha kalum which means little girl I say to you get up in Aramaic which was the popular language of the day in acts so Jesus did what Peter did in Acts chapter 9 Miracle Peter says Tabitha get up so basically apart from one letter he says exactly the same words as Jesus Jesus had said Peter said Tabitha um because the author is clearly making a connection to the reader that the ministry of Jesus continues in the name of Jesus through those he has chosen and empowered his Chosen and empowered followers the Jesus movement in other words is not dead since Jesus ascended to heaven but rather the movement of Jesus is exponentially expanding now it's not just Jesus it's all of his people get to do this so to this very day the ministry of Jesus continues in his name under his authority through his followers and is expanding to break it down super simple the things Jesus did are the things we should do now we're going to go all the way back to the transition point between the ministry of Jesus and the commission of Jesus to his followers there's this moment where Jesus is laying out the ground rules for what happens after he ascendants so here's the moment the pandolf moment it's acts 1 8 which was referred to several times over the last month acts 1 8 Jesus says this is before this moment with Peter he says you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem throughout Judea and Samaria into the ends of the Earth so Peter is out here doing the same stuff that Jesus used to do he's Healing The Sick he's raising the dead because he had listened to Jesus he had become empowered or baptized in the Holy Spirit he had done exactly what Jesus told him to do in Acts chapter 1 verse 8. he wanted to do he wanted to continue the mission of Jesus so he did what Jesus asked him to do remember that there's a connection point to all of this miraculous stuff in verse 40 when it skipped over to the next story with a Tabitha Peter asked them all to leave the room he knelt and prayed turning to the body he said get up Tabitha and she opened her eyes when she saw Peter she sat up I want you to think about Tabitha Tabitha for a minute she apparently was very important to the church because the church was desperate for her the church was desperate for her to not be dead her Ministry to other people was deep and it was real it was one of the most powerful and Infamous influential Ministries in all of the Bible she was and what the ministry was was this she was always doing kind things for others and helping the poor so Tabitha Tabitha befriended poor widows who lived in the city of Joppa now this is the modern city of Tel Aviv and it's the same city that Jonah tried to run away from when he was running away from God it's the same city in a non-biblical story Napoleon hung out here for a while too that's not in the Bible but that's that was history Tabitha was likely wealthy and well educated but her real riches was not that it was her good deeds she was so full of good deeds and constantly enriched the lives of others through her acts of kindness she was so kind and so important in their lives so deeply influential that they corporately decided to ask Peter to come over and ask God to raise her back to life what does this mean it speaks to the importance of helping those that have not been as blessed as you have been blessed it speaks to the importance of kindness at the very center of things it is kindness that moves the heart of people in the Book of Romans in the Book of Romans chapter 2 it says in chapter 2 verse 4 we get this idea that it is the kindness of God that leads people to repentance not the anger of God not the wrath of God not the disappointment of God not the frustration of God which are all real things but it is the kindness of God that leads people to repentance another version the message says God is kind but he's not soft in kindness he takes us firmly by the hand and leads us into a radical life change that is why as a follower of Jesus Christ that you begin to desire to get involved in situations that most other people don't want to get involved in or even notice God is developing within you the character of kindness to be more like him True Believers are ultimately and often recognizable by their heart of kindness now as a citizen in the kingdom of God kindness is simply part of what it means to be part of the kingdom of God it's part of who we are becoming so today if you examine your heart you look closely and if in there you find apathy or resentment or frustration or bitterness or unforgiveness instead of kindness it means there's some aspect of your life that you have not yet turned over to Jesus maybe you're holding on to bitterness or holding on to some identity that you've clung onto for your whole life for whatever reason now when I read the story of Tabitha I have so many competing thoughts maybe maybe Tabitha was just so tired from doing kind things that she had to die for a minute to get some rest you know like I'm exhausted Lord I'm just going to kick it for a while I'm just gonna I'm just gonna die for a minute you know I don't think that's what happened but it's a fun thought um the far more likely reality is that her Ministry was so effective that the devil got nervous and came after her that's more consistent with the themes that we see in Scripture now so pay attention friends to that the more effective the more Ministry of a church has or of an individual the more attack that that person and Ministry comes under that's reality it should not surprise you to hear about a Ministry or a Ministry leader that has been deeply influential who has experienced setback or challenge or failure in some area of their life because from the moment they took on that mantle they've been under assault from the enemy from the moment they were elevated so I want to remind us today and I've reminded many times in the past don't kick a brother or sister when they're down instead instead we must posture ourselves to respond with grace and mercy and restoration now that's not always easy that's not always easy and sometimes it's difficult but when you do it you step on the head of Satan by loving and restoring and embracing the Fallen now that does not mean you guys gotta let me finish my thoughts okay the uh this does not mean that there aren't consequences there's consequences but consequences with kindness and grace and mercy need to happen at the same time when we're restoring people that have fallen we don't kill our wounded and bury them in disgrace we heal them and restore them back to life as your pastor I wage war against Satan and his demons on your behalf every single day now sometimes that battle is complicated and tiring and it's nice to know that there are others fighting with you sometimes now I know that many of you pray for me and my family every day please keep it up I covet your prayers for my family for our staff for our leaders for the whole church because when one person pulls a rope and is struggling many more are coming alongside the pull make it much easier now when I read this story of Tabitha and Peter and the whole thing I I think of a football team whose best receiver just got like knocked out on the field really hard and the players are like oh man what do we do we're going to lose if we don't have this guy so they call out the coach Peter under the field and the coach says come on get up the team needs you it's like come on I I know you got knocked out but get back in the game the NFL doesn't let you do that anymore but back when I used to that's kind of how it worked in our everyday life there's a reality that there are moments in our life when we get knocked out when you become functionally spiritually dead but the truth is we need you back in the game we need you to get back up we need you to not stay on the mat we need to not stay in the grave and somebody in the room needs to listen to me right now as the worship team comes up you've been knocked out on the field of Life you've been essentially dead to life and the Holy Spirit says to you today get up stop being dead arise get up stop being dead Jesus said this to dead people all the time now you're breathing in the room today so you're not physically dead but if you walked in here today being spiritually dead or mostly dead it's time to get back up maybe you've messed up maybe you've disappointed others I want you to hear this we'll forgive you today and we'll forgive you tomorrow and if death has just been lingering over you I want you to know that today we release you from that death and urge you to receive your healing you are allowed to get back up you are allowed to get back up to life you are allowed to find Healing I want you to know we will embrace your return you might be dead and nobody even knows you're dead get back up [Music] in other words it's time stop being dead let's go let's go all right everybody stand with me as we close today [Music] across this room if you just bow your heads and close your eyes I know that our speaker last week told you you could keep your eyes open close your eyes [Music] give people around you a chance to respond as you're reflecting and responding is there a mat today that you need to roll up and get rid of is there a bridge that you haven't burned is there something that you are still holding on to that you've got to roll up and get rid of [Music] some of you that might be very real today today's the day to Let It Go today's the day to roll it up and give it to Jesus Brothers your response might be that there's a kindness that you know you need to extend you have been holding it back and you need to extend a kindness for others in the room today whether it be covid whether it be disruptions or disappointments something has messed with you and you have found yourself being spiritually unalive spiritually dead there's somebody today it's time for you to not be dead anymore time to come back to life time to let God heal you once and for all that's how you can respond today it's by giving that to Jesus as a worship team closes us with this song I want you to respond the altars are open for you to have a chance just to dedicate some time to God about this but let's spend some time in prayer today the altars are open foreign", "[Music] hello east coast international church welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting today we will be discovering how much prayer makes a difference in our lives and in the lives of those around us in luke chapter 22 verses 31-32 jesus says simon simon satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat but i have prayed for you simon that your faith may not fail and when you have turned back strengthen your brothers satan comes to steal kill and destroy and keep people far from god can you imagine if jesus simply said hey simon peter satan wants to sift all of you as wheat and left it at that but jesus did not he then went on to say that he had prayed for simon peter that when he would have his moment of later denying jesus he would have the opportunity to repent to turn back to continue following jesus as well as to strengthen his brothers imagine the impact that that had on simon peter in those moments where he was tempted by satan in those moments where he felt like he had to deny his faith he had those words of jesus to remember that he had the opportunity to turn back so we see here that jesus himself modeled what it looks like when prayer makes a difference in other people's lives had he not prayed for simon peter we don't know how that moment would have gone but it certainly wouldn't have gone the way it did and simon peter may not have had the same influence that he had and still has on our church today and so now let's pray for our own impossible situations and the impossible situations that we see in people around us people that we love people that we've invited to church people that we know also need god to move in their lives god thank you so much that we have this opportunity to come before you and recognize how much prayer makes a difference god we thank you that jesus modeled this for us that he showed us right here plain and clear how much prayer makes a difference god we thank you that we can come before you and that we can lift up the people in our lives that we're thinking of right now the people whose situations are burdening our hearts the things that we see people landing in over and over again the people that we see need your freedom god we lift these people up to you god we pray that you would intervene in their lives we pray that they would see how much they are loved by you and that they would ask for you to lead their lives and their situations god that they would find their hope in you in jesus name we pray amen [Music] thank you so much for joining us here today we hope that you will continue to pray throughout the day and that you'll join us tomorrow as we continue our week of prayer and fasting", "welcome back to our prayer podcast this is day five today we're talking about promise seekers here's the idea who are the people in your life whose faith is contagious again who are the people in your life whose faith is contagious one of my favorite stories to share is of a friend i had in bible college i was an incoming freshman he was an upperclassman about to graduate he took me under his wing and one day we were having a conversation and he turned to me and he asked me a question that was so simple that it caught me off guard and he asked me this question in a non-religious non-judgmental way he said david do you pray and in that moment i just said yeah of course i pray but that was a lie because at the time my prayer life was not really something i i thought about i i didn't have the habit of prayer and most of the time when i did pray in public it was usually phrases that i had learned and regurgitated um as i was growing up in the church but to talk to god was something that i wasn't really exploring at the time but my friend challenged me in that area and consequently i would hide from him like if i saw him coming i would go in a different direction and i would only talk to him when he was around other people because i just felt convicted because i knew that he was a person of prayer and when i thought about it closely years later all the people that i remember him hanging out with the most they were also people of prayer and people of faith fast forward years later when i started to really take my faith seriously and really decided to surrender my life to jesus and let him be the leader of my life i started to think well what are the habits that i need to develop and guess what came to mind my friend i remembered his prayer habits his faith habits and i was able to have some sort of model to imitate today i want to read from psalm 122 verses 1 and 2. this is a psalm that king david wrote it says i was glad when they said to me let us go to the house of the lord and now here we are standing inside your gates o jerusalem today as you pray and as you seek the promises of god i want to share with you three prayer principles that will energize your prayer life the first principle is this faith habits like many life-consuming habits can be highly contagious faith habits can be highly contagious have you ever noticed that there are habits that are often caught rather than taught you just catch them based on the people you hang around you don't even realize it sometimes that's because these habits are contagious well faith is the same way when you get around faith-filled people you begin to pray differently you become energized you become encouraged you become motivated to pray for higher things because you realize our god is big and these are the people who rub shoulders with you and their faith becomes contagious the second principle is this if we want to grow in our faith we need people around us who take their faith seriously in this psalm he says i was glad when they said to me who is they well these are people who are already passionate about god he didn't have to motivate them in that moment they were inviting him and he said i was glad and that's what happens when you get around people who are faith-filled they begin to mobilize you because you're like wow man i'm so encouraged by these prayers i want to start praying differently than i than i have been that's what happens when you get around people who take their faith seriously and last but not least the right people will get you to the right places what were they saying to king david they were saying let us go in other words these were people who were already going to faith enhancing environments they were already used to going to the house of the lord a house of prayer that is what they did and look at the consequences of that in verse 2 he says and now here we are have you ever found yourself in a place and you were like how did it get here well that works in the negative but in the positive as well sometimes when you hang around people who are crazy enough to believe that nothing is impossible for god don't be surprised if you find yourself praying differently don't be surprised if you find yourself serving if you find yourself being more compassionate if you find yourself being more generous don't be surprised and this is not about willpower and just toughing it out it's about getting around the right people people who will encourage your faith let us pray jesus today we ask for courage as we seek out people whose faith is contagious people who take their faith seriously and are at the right places because their hearts are after you i pray god that we would be able to surround ourselves with promised seekers other believers who will motivate us and encourage us to do the things that please you god i pray that as our church prays this week our faith would multiply that the impossible would become possible and that you would get all the glory all the fame god it is for you that we live help us to learn how to love the things that bring your heart joy we pray these things in the mighty name of jesus amen thank you so much for your time and we'll see you again tomorrow bye bye", "\n\n**4.16.19**\n\n**Absent -  Joshua (vacation)**\n\n**General Notes -**\n\n

back helping out that's great they are they're doing the broadcast and lighting today so uh that's that's great great job guys let me take you back a couple of years to when I was a junior in high school um couple years couple years ago I had the opport un to spend a week at a thing called boy State boy state is this it's kind of like a training ground for young aspiring political activists this was uh at the time very appealing to me since at that time in my life my goal was to serve as a US senator for the state of Indiana and so my first declared major at Purdue University was uh political science and Russian so I was like going all in um well at this week Long training ground into the intricate details of state and uh federal government we does not sound exciting um we we had an opportunity to meet uh with someone who would become the next uh Indiana Governor he was a Indiana political rock star he was a candidate for governor and would become the youngest governor in the state of Indiana uh he came through this convention and he spoke with us and spent a lot of time with us during that week and whenever he would talk we would all sit around as he talked and hang on every word that he said we were just so excited to to to hear what he had to say and and how it could impact our future it was just one those moments we like no matter what he said everybody was just hanging on every word well about 200 decades ago there was another group of people that were experiencing a hanging on every word kind of moment with uh somebody it was a large crowd of people that had gathered on a large Hill on a large Hills side next to the sea in order to listen to a man named Jesus they were hanging on every word that he said amen you see these people they had traveled from a a lot of places from around the region some of them had traveled quite some uh distance and one of the reasons that they were hanging on every word that he said was that they had been around him many of them had seen him heal sick people they had heard that he had uh miraculous Powers some of them had seen those miraculous Powers they were even beginning to believe that Jesus might be the chosen one of God that they had been waiting for for thousands of years the people listening on the hillside that day were a group of people that had been deeply oppressed and abused by their leaders their government govern leaders and their religious leaders and as Jesus is talking what Jesus is saying is not the same things that everyone else has said he starts to talk about something called the kingdom of God and it sounded good this was a different kind of Kingdom in fact it sounded so good that they began to wonder could it possibly be true that this kingdom is for me because it sounds like it's a great Kingdom and I'm not sure if they let people like me into that Kingdom because if they're hearing right it sure sounded like Jesus was saying they had a shot so they were not casual listeners passing by just for entertainment they were regular people that were seeking and searching for truth just like many of us in the room today and that sets the scene for what the crowd that Jesus is getting ready to talk to and then Jesus said to them and what he's getting ready to to do is getting ready to give them the rule the the rule of his kingdom mean these are the governing principles by which his King operate inside of his kingdom it's not like oh here's a list of things you have to do to get into my kingdom it's when you're in my kingdom this is what takes place and so he says this he said in what is called the Beatitudes blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of of Heaven blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of God blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you so Jesus is teaching and giving the people instructions the the rule the instructions for his kingdom and so we get to peek in on uh the words of Jesus because the words of Jesus in that day were not just meant for the people on the hill they were meant for all of humanity for all time but these instructions that Jesus is giving are different you see the last kind of last time they heard about a bunch of instructions or rules it was a different kind of a rule it was like the Ten Commandments rule like don't do this do this don't do this do this don't do this these are different instructions that Jesus is giving and they are are very different than the other religious leaders of the day these instructions that Jesus is giving is focusing on the inner righteousness of one's life a transformation of the heart and the inner life he's not talking about behavior modification Jesus is talking about a transformation of the heart from the inside out an inner transformation that causes one to eventually have external change external behavior that lines with your inner values this was very different because the religious leaders of the day and even today so often promote external behaviors first that change our external behaviors years before your heart's ever been transformed all right thus giving you a legalistic religion and a lot of hypocrisy going around so when you see people that promote or or say they're they're part of the kingdom and then they fail a lot what's really happening there it's it's to be expected but it's because uh the inner work has not been done okay they've been focusing on the external work only we can relate to that because that's happened to us we've we've had we've been doing external work sometimes without doing inner work so Jesus focuses instead on the transformation of the Heart by the arrival of the kingdom of God which will then direct uh the trans transformation of the entire person starting with the heart moving out to Word thought action and deeds and so far so this this rule is different is the point so far if we're hearing correctly the man Jesus has said that both rich and poor can enter the kingdom and anyone with a humble Spirit can simply repent and come in that's your ticket in it does not matter how much money they have or don't have because we're all going to be on the same team in God's Kingdom amen and it it seems to get even better because Jesus had said that those who are Sorrowing will not be left out they won't be left behind they will be welcomed to come and be comforted they will not be shunned but rather they will be cared for imagine on the hillside that day imagine on the hillside that day a father with five kids who's in destitute poverty and his wife's just passed away thinking as he listens to the words of Jesus while he can't figure out what the world to make do next and Jesus says that he would have been thinking I think he's talking to me all right imagine the kind of hope that would have welled up within him as he realizes that Jesus was in fact inviting him into his kingdom or the imagine the mother whose child has just been taken away and sent to jail because he didn't realize he had any other options or couldn't find a way out imagine how she feels as she recognizes that the God of this Kingdom understands her pain and desires to comfort her these were the kinds of things that would have been happening in the hearts and minds of the listeners that day then there was even more that Jesus had said before we get to the part today he had said hey even you Gentle types that everybody just kind of Skips over you get to come on in right you don't have to be heartless raw meat eating conqueror Pusher driver achiever those that are driving back everybody else I said that for myself imagine that timid and gentle man or lady who has so often felt less than adequate because that's not how the world works and suddenly they realize that the kingdom of God is for them as well amen and especially for them in my mind I can see the crowd filled with expectation filled with excitement like like when you're rooting for the underdog team it's like what it means to be a New England Patriots fan nowadays right you're rooting for the underdog team in a in a the event and they're behind and it looks like they're going to lose but something happens and the tide begins to turn the team is coming back and you know that if they keep going in the same direction they're going to win amen I mean as Jesus is talking this Hillside of underdogs is thinking wait wait he's talking about us we're invited into the kingdom his kingdom something is changing here it's that kind of energy that you can see in the crowd you can just picture some guy getting really really excited and maybe at the most inappropriate time saying tell us more Jesus tell us more then there or others that would have quietly thought to themselves as the guy finishes yelling in the back that's not in the Bible I'm just making that up okay the um there were others that would have thought there's got to be a catch there's got to be a catch because this doesn't make any sense yet there're still listening amen waiting for the catch hanging on every word because this is the same man that they had seen heal all the diseases in town heal the paralyzed heal the demon possessed heal the mentally ill the same man that was now telling them they could be part of his kingdom and it sure sounded a lot different than any other Kingdom they had heard about and in his kingdom they would be welcome and not have to sit on the bench so Jesus says in Matthew 5:6 blessed are those that hunger and thirst for rightous rightousness for they will be filled another version says you're blessed when you're worked up a good appetite for God his he's food and drink in the best meal you'll ever eat today I want us to think about this idea of hungering and thirsting for righteousness you know all those people on the mountain that day they were hungry and thirsty for righteousness that's why they were there maybe you've known people that are desperate for God hungry for God thirsty for God and I think there's a couple of kinds of people like that I think there's the group of people that have had a like a lengthy gnawing hungering for God for righteousness and they just haven't known what to do with it then there's another group of people that all of a sudden they wake up one day and realize oh I'm in trouble and they get really hungry and thirsty for God like sharp sharp hunger pains you know however you get there you get there several years ago I had an experience where I sat down with a teenager that I'd been working with for a long time and she finally was ready she was finally ready to come clean she knew that she needed help turns out in her situation she had a couple of parents that really loved her and were able to help her so we knew we needed to reach out to her parents and I sat there in this meeting as this young person tells her parents about her secret involvement with drugs and alcohol and sexual promiscuity and the parents had absolutely no idea you could see her parents' Hearts break in this moment that they that she talked to them and in that moment this young lady realizes there's a Brokenness in the relationship between my myself and my parents now she can feel the pain and in that moment all she wanted to do was be right with her parents she was broken BR she desperately wanted to be right and they became right but it took some time there's a pain a hungering and thirsting but in our life we have a hungering and thirsting for righteousness to to be right with God and sometimes we get caught up in situations in real life where we don't measure up to the standard that we want to measure up to amen or perhaps we failed ethically or we're disappointed in how we responded to a situation or we failed morally or some crisis has come into our lives and it just builds and builds and builds and in the depth of our soul something says there must be more this isn't the way that life is supposed to be or maybe you walk through life with a really nasty and ugly attitude and everybody knows you're the negative person you can't seem to change it no matter what what you do every time you talk or think of something a critical or negative attitude emerges and in desperation for Joy you finally in your soul say there must be more perhaps in a need to feel a great need for selfworth maybe no one ever affirmed you in your your life and you're you're Desperately Seeking affirmation and you immerse yourself in your career or you become to become successful and you reach the top and still at the very top there's a nagging longing for something of great G worth than money or success and a void in your soul begins to cry out there must be more maybe it's your longings to be loved and accepted have been so you've been offering yourself to anybody that will just pay attention to you to somebody who for a few minutes or a few moments will tell you sweet little lies you know it's not true but at least for the moment it's better than being alone you know you shouldn't but you don't seem to be able to stop and from The Cry of your broken heart you hear your heart say there must be more that's who Jesus is talking to when he says these Beatitudes and he brings these instructions and rule for life in his kingdom perhaps what started as youthful experimentation has turned into a lifestyle of drugs or alcohol in order to give you a high that you always thought that you were supposed to find in life and so it's the parties and the clubs and the bars the times alone when your closest friend is your cigarette or your drink or your next hit something I'm trying to get everybody today okay as you get this okay so it's something from within you a dream that you had many years ago reemerges and screams out from your spirit that there must be more maybe you have an attitude towards God because you're scared of him or maybe you even feel like God hates you or wants nothing to do with you or perhaps you've been holding on to a great hatred towards God even though misplaced it's real and then in a moment of reality you realize this is not working and you cry out and you say there must be more almost every adult I have ever met has come to a place in their life where at some level they have thought there must be more than this and for those that are wise and those that understand this is a spiritual question there must be more it's a spiritual declaration and question and then those who are wise will simply turn to heaven in that moment for some of us every once in a while you're stopped dead in your tracks and say oh I would give anything if I could just be right with God because I know I'm not right with God right now it's a deep hunger from within you that you can't even explain it's a cry from within you that it says there must be more it's like a stain on your conscience of sorts that you can't get rid of regardless no matter how hard you try it's a recognition that you're not right you're not in right relationship with God and that something's wrong it's it's a cry that says I would give anything to have a clean conscience and to be right with God right now that's what Jesus meant when he said those that hunger and thirst for righteousness that's what he mean that's hungering that's thirsting you're seeking for God even though you don't know that's what you're doing the Bible has lots of examples of men who hungered and thirsted for righteousness there was a rich young ruler who was young powerful wealthy has at all but it's not enough he's having hunger pains spiritual hunger pains he knows there must be more he knows he's not right he knows something's off so he seeks out Jesus to ask ask him a question and to find out how he could be made right with God Luke 18 is where the question is asked a certain ruler asked Jesus good teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life the Rich Young Ruler asked a behavior modification question what must I do Jesus as the story plays out Jesus goes and grabs his heart Jesus goes goes and speaks to the issue the true heart issue yes Nicodemus was a religious uh teacher a teacher of religion and he goes to Jesus as a teacher of religion knowing something isn't right with him between him and God and he's having hunger pains and he knows there has to be something more and so in John chapter 3 it says there was a man named Nicodemus a Jewish religious leader who was a Pharisee after dark one evening he came to speak with Jesus Rabbi he said we all know that God has sent you to teach us your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you amen so they they talked for a while and Jesus said some things and Jesus said about himself this so that everyone who believes in Him meaning Jesus will have eternal life this is how God loved the world he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life amen God sent his son into the world not to judge the world but to save the world through him there is no judgment against anyone who believes in him but anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only son Nicodemus knew he wasn't right he had a hunger a thirst and he wanted to be right and when Jesus responds to him he goes after his heart there was an Ethiopian official who had made a long pilgrimage from Ethiopia to Jerusalem it's about just so you know it's about 1500 miles from Ethiopia by Chariot all the way to Jerusalem and he went there these 1500 miles to perform a religious ritual you've got to be pretty hungry and thirsty to do something like that okay in a chariot this not a plane okay took a long time and on the way back after performing this religious ritual something still isn't right so on the way back he's reading a scroll trying to figure out what it is that he needs to do to be right with God and the story is picked up in Acts 8: 27 Philip one of the early church leaders it says so Philip started out and he met the treasur of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under the kandake the queen of Ethiopia the unic had gone to Jerusalem to worship and he was now returning seated in his Carriage he was reading aloud from the book of the prophet Isaiah the holy spirit said to Philip go over and walk along beside the carriage Philip ran over heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah and Philip asked do you understand what you are reading the man replied how can I unless someone instructs me and he urged Philip to come up into the carriage and sit with him verse 35 so beginning with the same scripture Philip told him the good news about Jesus what's what's unique about each of these situations is that they are all hungry and thirsty for righteousness they know they're not in right relationship with God even though all of them were trying to be they can tell that something just isn't quite right they know there must be more and so they seek after the truth and in each situation the men are given the truth in response to their wholehearted seeking and so this leads us to this thought today God has established a universal principle that those who seek God in truth will find him Deuteronomy 4: 29 but if from there you seek the Lord your God you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul it's a promise that if we go after God God will meet us and in finding God he promises that the deep hungering and thirsting in our soul will be filled he restores hope where all hope has been lost he provides his strength in our weaknesses and to those that have lost the ability to dream he causes them to dream bigger than they have ever dreamed before yes that's what this is all about this hungering and thirsting for righteousness the psalmist says in chapter 34 the Lord is close to the Brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit another Psalm says he heals the Brokenhearted and binds up their W wounds Prophet says in Isaiah he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to those to to those today that have found themselves Broken Heart Ed and hungering for healing this is all a cry a cry of our soul to be right with God today to each who is hungry and eats who is thirsty spiritually pursuing God seeking Jesus makes it clear that the rule in the kingdom of God is that those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be filled as the worship team comes up I would say this that many of you are here today and you've had a gnawing hunger pain in your life for quite some time and something within you just simply wants to know that you're in a right relationship with God but somehow something seems off and you know you're not quite right hear the words of Jesus one more more time blessed are those that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled it's an invitation it's Jesus inviting you to be filled it's Jesus inviting you to bring your hunger and thirstiness to Jesus so that he might fill you up because the rule in the Kingdom of Jesus is that those who are hungry and thirsty will be filled would you stand with me as we [Music] close would you just close your eyes and bow your heads across the room today just just so you can respond to the many of you [Music] today who hear this on some level you're crying out that there must be more that hunger that thirst God wants to fill you up to those who feel like you don't measure up you can't find joy in life no matter what you do those who have placed success above everything else those that are controlled by substances to receive your highs to those that just know that no matter what you do do you're just not right with God to all today who are hungry and thirsty you can be right with God because Jesus wants to fill you up and if that's you [Music] today first off you need to just tell Jesus what's going on just talk to Jesus we call that prayer but it's really just talking to Jesus tell him what's going on ask him ask Jesus to fill you up spend some time with Jesus and invite him to rescue you from your sin and surrender your life to [Music] him that's how this works we respond to the words of Jesus and let him do the healing work and give us that purpose fill us up from that hungry hungering and thirsting if that's you today you would just like to spend some time doing this the altars are open please just make your way up to the altar begin to talk to Jesus ask him to fill you up and invite him to rescue you today as the worship team leads us", "[Applause] all right good morning everybody look at Pastor Jesse walking up on stage like he's just gonna be up here every week now he did a great job last Sunday thank you Pastor Jesse which which well are you drawing from that was great stuff uh very much appreciated that as I was away traveling um in just a moment we're gonna uh look at the book of Acts uh just for a second but a couple of things before that we are putting together if you are normally a first service attender we are putting together a pre-service a prayer team at 9 15. if you're interested in joining it just show up around 9 15 on Sundays and come in here and just start to pray the uh before the service another thing I need your help praying about is we have made an offer as a church we've made an offer on two different properties on Monroe Street to purchase them for some things that we need to accomplish and uh it's certainly not a done deal or anything it's just literally the very beginning and so we just are praying for God's Direction and uh to give us Direction and for his purposes to be Advanced uh here in Lynn and so that's what's going on uh with that prayer request now this is the year of Bible engagement which means we're going to at least once a month come up here and and walk you through a couple of things and so we've covered a few different books of the Bible so far in this month the month of March we are all supposed to reading what book of the Bible acts okay better than the first service thank you the okay excellent I think that's because some of the first service people forgot what time it was and they're in the second service but yeah but anyhow yeah so it's kind of bringing it here so we uh so the book of Acts and any time you're getting ready to read a brand new book of the Bible or a letter or a section of the Bible it's really important that you take a minute and recognize what it is you're reading like what it is you're reading don't just read it and try to understand what's happening with it uh and so that's what we're gonna so the book of Acts what's the full name of the book of Acts acts of the Apostle Acts of the Apostles who are the apostles the 12 disciples the disciples right so it's uh the disciples plus a few others it's kind of a complicated designation but basically people that that saw Jesus alive okay and uh but the disciples plus a few others as well and it's a so let me stop there so it's the Acts of the Apostles and who wrote why don't we go ahead and start read Acts chapter one uh I put my glasses on so I can see okay here we go all right chapter one says in my first hold on in my there we go who's my in my Luke Luke okay who's Luke the writer Luke is the writer of the book of Acts keep going in my first book first book so that means he had another book what was the other book The Book of Luke all right okay so you got it okay so Luke wrote Luke and ax in fact some would say it's actually the same book just part one part two but for some reason they put the books in order Matthew Mark Luke John acts making it seem like it's two completely separate books by inserting that there's lots of reasons why they ordered them the way I would have ordered them differently but I'm not in charge so okay so uh so in my first book keep going I told you Theophilus okay Theophilus was he one of the disciples no I don't remember Theophilus except from Luke so who's who's the office I don't know that's probably the real answer that's probably the real answer but we think that Theophilus was a Roman official so that's unique because this is a Lucas Jewish and he's writing a letter or writing this book to Theophilus who's not Jewish he's a gentile and it makes you wonder what that relationship was how did that relationship start because they weren't really supposed to hang out was this one of the guys that was in charge of keeping the peace when Jesus was doing his stuff was he watching all of these years was he a leader of a community it's just interesting clearly Luke is trying to connect with Theophilus in the Book of Luke and the book of Acts keep going I told you Theophilus about everything Jesus began to do and teach so that was in the first book so in the first book the reason he wrote Luke was to tell Theophilus about all the stuff Jesus did so that's what Matthew Mark Luke and John are about keep going until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving oh I'm sorry we went too far we went too far sorry so you you can read the bible really slow it's fine because they're set up like in chapters you might feel like you have to jump all the way to the finish that chapter you don't have to you can read a sentence you can read a paragraph because sometimes there's a lot of stuff that you have to figure out as you're reading it's okay feel free to read slow like on simmer like if you try to like like do a pot roast like in 30 minutes that's not going to cut it it's not gonna be any good you got to let this sometimes you have to simmer when you're reading the Bible okay so what's happening here is in the book of Acts what do we read when we read throughout the Book of Acts what are we about to read we're about to read the start and the birth of the church particularly the first 30 years yeah so the first 30 years of the church so meaning as soon as Jesus death uh crucifixion death resurrection and then Ascension to Heaven acts as the 30 years following that so if you're curious what happened right after Jesus ascended to Heaven this is how you find out what happened this is really important because this is after Jesus ascended which means it's the same time period we're in which means the stuff that takes place in Acts is stuff that can take place today it's the same setup this is instructions for us the book of Acts you're learning about it seeing what's happening I'm like oh this is what we're supposed to be doing pay attention when you're reading the book of Acts to things like I didn't know we were supposed to do that so this is an interesting book because of that now where did this take place where did this book take place well not California like you said not California not in California uh but Jerusalem so it starts in Jerusalem and then branches out immediately scatters all over the Eastern Mediterranean if you're not uh geographically proficient like most Americans the uh we we it's like Italy Greece turkey Syria you know in that part of the world okay that's where all of this has taken place and so it's an important thing for you to pay attention to I'm excited about that because my wife and I are going to be traveling this summer we're taking our first sabbatical we're taking a mini sabbatical to gear up really for the next half of our ministry we've been we're going to be celebrating our 30-year uh anniversary this summer [Applause] uh but even though we're just about to be married 30 years we've been serving alongside of each other in Ministry for 33 years at this point and so we're going to be traveling from uh June 24th to August 5th on this sabbatical and really we're gearing up so that we can spend the next 30 Years work serving alongside each other in Ministry so that's what's going on here but the reason I'm telling you that is because when we're doing that we're going to all of these places we're reading about next we're going to go to as many as we can and we're going to go see because he's a real actual places they're not like fantasy it's not it's not a legend they actually happen in these actual real places and I just want to go see because that's who I am I just want to go see them all right and so my wife's like so excited laughs she'll she'll be excited I assure you so I think that's good that's what you need to know to get started when you're reading the book of Acts so there you go thank you Pastor Jesse all right [Applause] all right [Applause] I'm just gonna make sure my phone's off all right that way don't call me all right um I don't need those anymore after a very strong High School football career Wesley Carter was not offered a scholarship to play football in college because he was considered too small he was unchosen for college so he went to college anyway and he tried out as a walk-on to his Texas college and he made the team turns out he played all four years as a very strong impact player in 2004 the NFL draft was coming but Wesley Carter was not invited to the NFL combine and was not drafted to the NFL once again it was because he was considered too small to play he was unchosen but he didn't give up and he did eventually sign with the San Diego Chargers football team where he was released from the team after one game because they chose someone bigger than him because he was too small and unchosen Wesley was regularly unchosen but he still didn't give up after a brief stint with the Miami Dolphins the New England Patriots finally traded for him his whole name is Wesley Carter Welker and he became the all-time reception leader for the New England Patriots to this day he is still the all-time reception leader he went from unchosen to uncontested and I want you to think about that idea today how do you go from unchosen to uncontested have you ever had one of those moments when you were in life not good enough or not big enough or not strong enough or not holy enough or not smart enough not romantic enough not clever enough not cool enough you know just not enough and as a result you found Yourself unchosen by regular Society now sometimes sometimes it's not about not being enough sometimes it's about being too much like you're too much like your too unique you're too special too quirky too unusual or as my youngest daughter says two extra we're all strange in our own way some of us have quirks some of the quirks are not good quirks some of us have some bad habits some Hang-Ups even some painful experiences that have left some scars we're not quite right you might say you got yourself some issues some issues that maybe you inherited but some issues that perhaps you've also created those things that make you feel different or like you aren't what you're supposed to be you know things like this like maybe everybody around you all of a sudden is getting married or is already married but you're single still or maybe recently divorced maybe it's that everybody around you seems happy and everything's going for him but there you are stuck in a pit of depression or wrestling with an addiction it sure does look like everybody else has a lot of friends there you are remaining super lonely or could it be that you were pretty breed up as a kid and it's left you feeling damaged you feel like you're not quite right and everywhere you go you remain simply unchosen what does the world do with you in those situations the world has a way of Simply pushing you aside because you're different isolating you or persecuting you for not being good enough or cool enough and as a result we can live in fear and isolation living purposeless lives what should we do where do we turn in these moments pay attention to this very carefully just the scripture tells us that God chooses the unchosen Psalm chapter 68 says this he is a father to the fatherless defender of the widows this is God whose dwelling is holy God places the lonely and families he sets the prisoners free and gives them Joy he makes the rebellious live in a sun scorched land what does this mean it means that God chooses the fatherless God chooses widows God chooses the lonely God chooses the prisoners that doesn't make any sense but that's who God chooses James 1 27 says pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the father means caring for Orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you that means God chooses widows God chooses orphans in Luke chapter 14 the message says it this way people who never get invited out the Misfits from the wrong sides of the tracks or in the traditional interpretation it says instead invite the poor the crippled the lame and the blind God chooses the poor The Misfits the injured the crippled the blind that's who God chooses which means when you are unchosen and unchoosable God chooses you doesn't matter who else chooses you God chooses you because God chooses people that got issues God is Awesome thank you Lord right God has always had a thing for choosing people who aren't exactly perfect specimens with picture-perfect pasts and we should pay attention to this next scripture remember dear brothers and sisters that a few of you few of you will rise in the world's eyes are powerful or wealthy when God called you instead God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise and he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful God chose things despised by the world things counted as nothing at all and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important as a result no one can ever boast in the presence of God meaning God just chose you it sure sounds like these unchosen moments throughout all of your life throughout all of our lives these unchosen moments are really just to set up for a great comeback a few examples God chose a man named Joseph to save his part of the world from famine despite the fact that Joseph came from a family so dysfunctional that his brothers sold him into slavery now that's some family issues right there in fact God uses this traumatic event in Joseph's life to ultimately change the world because God chose the unchosen to save the world God also chose Gideon who was a fearful farmer to lead to lead his army God was choosing the unchosen God chose a woman named Ruth to be one of Jesus's grandmothers she was a widow and a foreigner but God chooses her in spite of her untrusable status because he wants to open up the kingdom of God to all people from All Nations and her weakness was in fact the very thing that gives us hope today right now it gives us hope that God chooses the unchosen God chose Moses to represent him to be his spokesperson even though in the book of Exodus Moses pleads with the Lord oh Lord I'm not very good with words I've never been I'm not now even though you have spoken to me I get tongue-tied and my words get tangled God chose him anyhow God chose the unchosen oh about Moses too he was also a murderer that's an issue that's an issue but God chooses people with issues and in case you thought your issue was too big God says otherwise God chose Rahab I love Rahab God chose Rahab as a sports starring role in the Bible if I had to pick my favorite Bible Heroes I would pick her and all the other ones too but that's fine too but I would pick her Rahab was living a life a very complicated life and it involved prostitution an ancient prostitution it was a very complicated thing as is modern but God chooses Rahab he sees her God sees Rahab where she is at he sees what's going on with her he's going to set her up for a great opportunity but God uses Rahab to bring Victory to God's people you see Rahab for all of her life she had been unchosen by polite Society for her whole life and now God singles her out and chooses her to offer her a new chance at a new life when she takes it she didn't stay in her mess she chose the new life God chose David to be the king of his people and throughout David's life we see challenges and struggles yet in spite of David's struggle God keeps restoring him and using him not because it was okay not because David was faultless and strong but because David knew that he was weak and was desperately willing to be made right with God God chooses him because of that attitude and that heart the irrefutable evidence of scripture is that God has a history of choosing untrusable people messy people messy problems messy pasts tell your neighbor he's talking about you be nice be nice I said it I said if I if I hurt your feelings I'm sorry oh if you have ever felt unqualified in life because of your mess and how much of a mess your life has been and I'm going to give you a way out surrender your mess to God today and let God's strength show up to overcome those weaknesses let God turn the overcoming of your mess well I gotta stop here I hear a lot that your mess be your message this is not a good idea your mess is not the message the overcoming of your mess is the message and let God turn take that and give you a brand new message because God chooses people with issues which means God chooses us he chooses you he chooses me people with messes you see God created the church to be a safe place for the unchosen and the untrusable and to be a place of love for those who might feel a bit out of place churches to be a place of acceptance but not only is the church to be a place of acceptance It's also a training center for people who want to learn to use their abilities to become part of a team with a mission the greatest Mission that's ever been known to save the world but it's not your best skills and traits that God tends to use in that mission see God wants to redeem your weaknesses and use them to reclaim the world and draw people to himself we see God do this all throughout the Bible you might be wondering how in the world was God's might how might God use your weaknesses well maybe you've been through some challenges maybe that's a relational difficulties perhaps a divorce and eventually you'll find healing through that divorce well see God wants to take that Brokenness in your life and use it to minister to other people who are experiencing heartbreak maybe you've struggled with addiction but because you let God come in and strengthen you in times of weakness you will be raised up as an example of how God can bring Supernatural healing to a person's life and maybe you suffer or have suffered from something like depression well you can use your journey and your story to bring hope to those in seemingly impenetrable Darkness even if you still wrestle because you have the joy of God within you in spite of difficult moments it draws people to him and if you surrender it to God he will use it the church the community of Jesus is a community of severely broken human beings being restored that's what the church is the Jesus team is a team of flawed forgiven but now Faithful Servants second Corinthians chapter 12 says this my grace is all you need my power works best in weakness man if you thought you had to be strong it's literally the opposite in our weaknesses God's power works that's the worship team comes up the Bible says that each of us has special abilities that God has gifted us with maybe it's the ability to encourage someone or to lead or to teach or to show Mercy or whatever happens to be and they may seem like simple abilities but when God empowers those things we become capable of doing things we could never do on our own since we can't do it alone God puts us on a team God joins us together he shows us how to give Grace to others and to empower and empowers a team that can truly turn a city or the world upside down a team a church of the unchusable now chosen by God for the greatest Mission the world has ever seen which is to bring good news to the poor healing to the broken freedom for the captive Injustice for the oppressed and that is exactly how you go from unchosen to uncontested would you stand with me as we close today go ahead stand up [Applause] Fast and Furious today I want to encourage you today I want to encourage you to think about those things those weaknesses those struggles those issues those challenges those things that that you've not yet surrendered to God if there are some things that you're wrestling with today I want to encourage you go ahead and surrender that to Jesus Let Jesus use that weakness let him come in and redeem the story let him come in and and and bring healing and wholeness to your scenario some of you today the idea that God chooses you is still complicated to understand because no one has ever chosen you but I want to tell you from the day from before you were born God has chosen you and he's been trying to get you to understand it your whole life that he chooses you he's calling you today I would encourage you join with Jesus today join with Jesus today respond to his call join his mission as well to bring that same healing and wholeness to everyone around you the worship team will take it from here and as they do let's just spend some time responding to Jesus the altars are open let's just let's just turn it all over to Jesus today foreign", "[Applause] good morning East Coast International Church it's really awesome to see all your faces today uh I just want to thank Pastor Kurt for giving me the opportunity to speak and bring God's word to you guys uh this morning uh my name is Jesse I'm one of the associate pastors here at this church thank you thank you um I oversee our media Department all things media we have an awesome team and I also have the privilege of overseeing our youth ministry All City youth which is also an awesome awesome Ministry um a week ago we were doing our staff planning Retreat and we were going through the calendar and I realized that like last month was uh my 4year anniversary of being on staff at church which is crazy cuz I feel like I blinked in all these years just passed by probably was because of a pandemic right that kind of just like rushed everything forward but um but out of the four I've only been pasturing two years so I'm only like two and a halfish years into this role and the way I got on staff is is something that I I truly will never forget to make a long story short uh I first first heard of this church because of an annual Father's Day pig roast that we do here and I don't know what it I think you know the pork was calling me your son but but I really felt like like God was telling me like this is where you have to go like I knew that that what was happening at this church was something I wanted to be a part of that that this is where I wanted to serve because of the ways that they were um creating these programs and events to reach people in these more nontraditional um outlets and so I remember making my way to East Coast International Church and ending for a bit and and at some point I got an internship and I I I remember I got to meet weekly with Pastor cry and eat some tacos I talk to L and uh you know just talk Ministry and all that stuff and and in my internship I remember praying to God and saying you know God whatever opportunity Pastor K brings to me through this internship to get through the doors of this church to start working and and and putting in work God I'm going to say yes whatever it is I'm going to say yes because I'm believing that it's not just him telling me hey we have this opportunity for you I believe it's from you telling me that this is what you have for me and so couple months go by PK and I are driving together in one of our like weekly meetings and and he looks at me and he says hey I I have a work opportunity for you if you're interested and I remember I just felt the Goosebumps like every I was am cuz I was like oh this is it like this is the opportunity right like this was what I was waiting for like he was going to be like hey I want to bring you on as Pastor we're going to get to work we're going to put a dent in the gates of hell we're going to do some Kingdom work together and I was like let's go and so as I looked and I was like what do you have for me he was like uh so we need a re receptionist but it's only part-time but he was like but we also need a maintenance person so like both of those roles together can give you uh full-time work and a couple things right you know like no disrespect to anybody in in the world of receptionist and maintenance but this is not what I was expecting this is not what I was passionate about this is not what I was aiming towards and and I mean like when it comes to All Things receptions I'm terrible at answering phone calls my mom's over there and she can attest you I don't pick up the phone and she hates it um and and I've never done any office admin work and outside of changing batteries from like a dead remote I've never done any maintenance in my life okay so there's that in my mind I immediately wanted to look at him and say like thanks but no thanks I'll stay as a barista man I'm not doing that right but but then I remember the prayer I remember the prayer where God was like hey yo remember you told me you said any opportunity that comes your way you're going to say yes cuz I brought it to you so after a couple conversations and working out if this was like financially doable for me I I said yes because I told God as long as I got to be a part of what you were doing at this church I was all in now I actually got the receptionist side of the job like pretty well I'm actually proud of myself for that but the maintenance work was an experience that I'll never forget like I remember that we had a leak one time and one of the like light covers was like all messed up so I had to change it and and and put in a new one and we had this one ladder and one of the legs on the ladder was a little short so it was a little wobbly and I remember just going on like the second or third step and I felt like I was like freezing in reality my body was just shaking cuz I was so scared of being just on a thirst I was like 3T off the ground man it was it was so and so it was terrible and I remember Pastor K was like Hey I actually need you to clean the basement and I was like oh bet like that's easy right like it's not hard to clean something and so I remember I held on to that assignment as long as I could I was spending like two weeks cleaning the basement trying to like getting like the paint like uh paint buckets just got to get it right got to get right and then obviously you can only clean something for so long and so once he saw that that looked good he was saying he said um hey we have this foyer here I need you to go ahead and start painting it we're going to repaint the room now here's why this is a problem cuz the only painting that was ever taught to me all right were by two people one his name was Bob Ross okay and the other guy name was Mr Miyagi okay so unless Pastor Kurt wanted me to paint some clouds or he was preparing me to fight like my arch nemesis what I learn from these two didn't apply to what he was asking me to do but what am I going to say right so I started painting the forer area and I'll never forget it one of the days I was putting all the paint away in this closet over there wrapping up and and I saw Pastor Kirk come down the stairs and go into the room to see kind of like the work that I did he didn't see me but I saw him okay and you know we have glass doors and so as I watched him walk into that room looked at the wall gave one look up and he just started laughing there was nobody else in the room with him he was laughing it wasn't a little chuckle or anything if you know the PK laugh I'm talking about like he was straight up laughing I'm like man this is terrible like this going to be the last time I work here it was so bad and and here here's the worst part about it all I was only putting on primer if you don't know what primer is that's the stuff you put on the wall to get rid of the current color so that you can actually put the new color he was laughing at my primer job like you know what I mean like you know how bad of a painter you have to be to do a terrible job putting primer on the wall I started that thing but once you saw that W I definitely wasn't the one I finished it it looks beautiful out there I have nothing to do with it I'm just G to be honest with you right now I I remember I I like last week I asked Pastor CR if he remembered that time and he laughed and he was saying um he said I I just assume people can paint until I see that they can't and so I hope that after me he stops assuming me because it was not good when I tell you that this church has humbled me in in more ways than I can count like I'm not even joking I have stories for days but as much as it humbled me it has grown me so much more it's only because of this church that I can climb up to the last step of a ladder and have no fears in my life I'm like over here like holding on to one thing while I'm stalling something else I I can install stage lights and put TV mounts on the wall like I can do stuff I'm not scared anymore um but but what the church really did was it reshaped my mindset around what it means to work in the Kingdom for the kingdom and roles because behind every miracle moment I've heard about in this church I've seen being at this church I discover that that behind all of that there were people of God meeting the needs doing tougher things and ordinary things behind the scenes to make way for the miracle I I learned that if we want to see God do the extraordinary and to do all these awesome things it'll often times include doing ordinary things to make way for the extraordinary that's an important Kingdom principle to know that in order to make way for opportunities for God's kingdom to grow and expand there are just some things that need to be done that are often times hard messy complicated or just straight up ordinary and you're like what's the use and as we continue in our series let's go we've been learning about these awesome Kingdom Builders in Acts and as we explore chap 6 today we're introduced to a man named Steven whose life I believe embodies this Kingdom principle so well and here's how the Bible introduces him act 6 says but as the Believers rapidly multiplied there were Rumblings of discontent the Greek speaking Believers complained about the Hebrew speaking Believers saying that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food so the 12 called the meeting of all the all the Believers they said we Apostles should spend our time teaching the word of God not running a food program and so Brothers select seven seven men who are well respected and full of the spirit and wisdom and we will give them this responsibility then we Apostles can spend our time in prayer and teaching the word everyone liked this idea and they chose the following Steven A Man full of faith in the Holy Spirit Phillip prores nicanor timman parus and Nicholas of Antioch an earlier convert to the Jewish faith I don't know if that's their name but that's their name okay so these seven men were presented to the apostles who prayed for them as who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them and here's what it says in verse 7 so God's message continued to spread the number of Believers greatly increased in Jerusalem and many of the Jewish priests were converted to in Acts 6 the church is in the midst of rapid growth if there's any tall people in the room and you had a grow Spirit like I don't I can't relate but I can only hope um any kind of rapid growth that you have and that there is there's this thing that that's called growing pains and and the growing pain that we see here in the church is that the Greek speaking Believers made a complaint that their widows were being neglected in their daily distribution of food in other words there was a issue of food insecurity and neglect taking place in the community it was such a problem that the attention was then brought to the apostles so they gathered all the followers and Believers together and straight up said hey we we see the legitimacy of this issue but we're we're not going to give up teaching the word of God to serve tables and to run a food program so you guys need to pick seven Men full of wisdom and of the holy spirit so that they can serve the widows while we devote ourselves to pray prayer and teaching the word and we see that seven people were chosen and awesome things happened but the important thing to note here is that the seven people weren't appointed just so that they could quiet the complainers who brought this problem up rather the church was recognizing a clear need and neglect that was taking place but the 12 who were in charge had their hands full they had too much going on they they had full-time gigs that they were already focused on so in order to continue to meet the spiritual needs while addressing the current physical need partners ship needed to happen they needed to appoint people who can give their full attention to feeding the widows who are being neglected and out of this acts tells us that God's message continued to spread and Believers were added to the kingdom of God God's kingdom continued to be built out of all of this and what we learn here is that Kingdom building is about sharing God's good news but it's also about expressing it by meeting the needs of those around us that as the church we don't just work to meet spiritual needs of the community but we also strive to meet the physical needs of the community as well and if we're going to continue to see the kingdom of God grow and expand these are two things that need to be walked alongside together but what we also see here is that sometimes how we do that doesn't always seem like as miraculous or grand as some of us would like you know like imagine you're part of this story right like you're witnessing the church grow in in an amazing way people that you knew that didn't know Jesus all of a sudden now know Jesus and and families that you never thought couldn't know Jesus now know Jesus and you're seeing Miracles and signs and wonders and all of these amazing things that are happening and and you're there just waiting for your opportunity to step right in right like y'all ever double jumped i j double jumped twice in my life and I stopped but like you're just waiting for that opportunity to say God I'm I'm ready I'm seeing all that's happening I am waiting to jump in and as you're waiting to jump in you hear about how the 12 ogs are now looking for people to lead in this new task that's been created and see all that the 12 have been doing the large number of people they've been preaching to the Miracles performed the the platforms that they've been standing on you're like bro sign me up and as the 12 call a big meeting and announce who will be given this new task you hear your name and now you're all amped up and so you get up when they call your name you go to the 12 and you tell them what do you have for me to do I got four sermons in my back pocket ready to go we can do four weeks we can do whatever we want I've seen how Peter prayed for the sick and seeing them healed I know exactly you need to hand first then you speak like I know it all like what do you have for me to do I am ready and the 12 look at you with a smile and say you're going to be serving tables like what would be your reaction right you hear about all these awesome things like I would be so bummed like what like they're not doing that why come I got to do that right like the 12 is out there doing crazy things for God's kingdom but I have to serve tables for the widows how can God's kingdom grow from that how how can I talk about Jesus there how can the miraculous take place if all I'm doing is serving tables maybe the seven didn't feel like that maybe they were just as excited but I I would have felt like that but what's interesting thing is that out of the seven deacons that were chosen for this task Steven is highlighted in specific acts 6 vers verse 8-10 says that Steven A manful of God's grace and power performed amazing Miracles and signs among the people but one day some men from the synagogue of free slaves as it was called started to debate with him they were Jews from Serene Alexandria and cissa and the province of Asia none of them could stand against the wisdom in the spirit with which Steven spoke act 6 continues to tell us that Steven performed amazing aming Miracles and signs among the people and if we were to continue reading what we would learn is that Steven's work and impact would actually create a Heavenly disruption so great that Jewish people from surrounding areas picked up a debate with him to try to shut down the work that he was doing and in those debates the Bible says that nobody was able to match the wisdom from which Steven spoke it angered the people so much so that they tried to frame him and make false accusations and he got him arrested and when it came time for him to defend his case to say why he's innocent rather than trying to prove himself innocent he instead doubled down on the truth he spoke prior and continued to profess Jesus it caused such a riot to the point where the people dragged him out and stoned him to death Steven was actually the first Christian martyr that we ever hear about meaning that he was the first Christian to die for professing Jesus this Kingdom Builder who played a mighty role in Kingdom advancement performed amazing signs and and miracles and professed Jesus so boldly that it costed him his life he did all this while his primary role was serving tables like there's no reason why that would that that the role that was given to him should have resulted in the way it did he wasn't positioned to preach to a mass crowd or lead in a mighty way he wasn't platformed to be seen by a multitude of people and this wasn't even a place to really display any abilities except for like you know putting three dishes on one arm I'm always impressed by that I don't know why when the waiters come in I'm like yo how you do that um his role was simply just to make sure that the widows were being fed role that seems too ordinary for some and maybe for others a little too difficult but as ordinary and difficult as that role might have been God's kingdom advanced in a mighty way because there was someone who was willing to stand in the gap of meeting a need you see church as Kingdom Builders your Effectiveness when it comes to sharing the good news and meeting the needs of others it has nothing to do with being in the best position or having the best platform or being in the place where you can display all of your abilities it actually has everything to to do with what you're doing in the position you find yourself right now how you represent Jesus with the platform you currently have and how you're using not your abilities but your availability to serve the kingdom in the kingdom of God there is no such thing as the best job or role or the spotlight because God can and has used many people who found themselves in the most ordinary roles to build his kingdom Steven didn't have the highest position or the biggest platform yet we still see the miraculous take place in his life because the miraculous doesn't happen when we do things that look miraculous remember the miraculous things happen when we're committed to the work of God on meeting the needs of others the miraculous happens when God uses our ordinary roles to do the miraculous as we talk about Kingdom building and we're expanding all this I I really wanted to take a minute to speak on our youth ministry because this has been a big question for All City youth like how can we develop into a youth ministry that is not addressing uh just the spiritual needs but a youth ministry that also addresses the physical needs of our teenagers I spent the last year listening and really looking into our local context researching to see the pain points of our communities and what the needs of our teenagers were here in Lynn in our surrounding areas and here's what we learned that a large number of students lack safe spaces they lack healthy mentors and they lack in holistic well-being meaning that they're behind or struggling academically emotionally mentally and spiritually and what we're witnessing right now is a generation of teenagers that are left to discover a best life fors that's shaped by their lack and their circumstances and not by the truth of Christ in order to address this problem of students lacking in wholeness we've been working to shift gears at all CDU to be a Ministry that focuses on discipling students through holistic mentorship meaning that as we're walking them in the faith we're also helping them recognize that God wants to change every area of their life that God wants to see hope displayed in every area of their life not just their Spirit our mission is to lead students to to discover fulfillment in Jesus so that they can walk in purpose and holess and when we made the purchase of 79 MOSI the building right next door Pastor CT let me know that he wanted that space to be where he held where we held All City Youth and I remember I was excited but then I I was thinking to myself man if all we did in that building was host a weekly youth night we'd be doing such a disservice to the mission that we're on and what we're trying to see God do so as we continue to respond to the needs of our teenagers we wanted to share and highlight that at East Coast International Church we're working to develop a youth center for middle schoolers and high school students of lint we're working to create a safe and monitored space where teenagers can find community be mentored and walked alongside with we're working to create a space that has technological access so that students can work on homework assignments and projects but also educational access so that they can get assistance in the areas where they struggle academically we're working to build a place where teenagers can develop the necessary skills for Independent Living Through lifes skill workshops and actually next year we already have two workshops scheduled that are focus on job education and financial [Applause] education we're also working to redo the back parking lot to not only open up parking for our church which is the first time we've ever been able to do that but to also add basketball hoops that will allow for us to have summer tournaments and basketball clinics as a way to create better opportunities for our teenagers and bring the community together we believe that through this work God will continue to do the miraculous as teenagers will come to know and accept the Fulfillment that is only found in Jesus we believe that God will do the miraculous and making broken parts of our teenagers whole as they walk in the purpose that God has for them we believe that we'll be able to create a hub for local organizations as we partner with them to continue and empower the great work they're already doing for our teenagers and we believe that through partnering with these organizations and creating the right programming we will see an increase in academic scores in teenagers pursuing both higher education and joining the workforce and although we have much to do our vision for our teenagers is that they will be healthy adults who will Embrace both their faith and well-being in their homes and in their production as members of our community we believe that the generation we have now will be a generation that reshapes the city of Lyn and reshapes the makeup of how homes have been in Lynn and will ultimately transform our communities for the better bringing all the glory to God and expanding his kingdom the reason why we share this though is like it's awesome but the reason why we share this with you is because you are a part of this work both in your prayers but also in your involvement if we're going to see God do the miraculous in this space just like in act 6 we need people who are willing to stand in the Gap to meet the needs of our teenagers people who will be a mentor for our teenagers as their disciple people who will care and be present with them and people who will help with our teenagers academic needs and teach them the life skills they might be lacking in this doesn't happen by the act of one person it only happens when there is a church of Kingdom Builders who are committed to sharing God's news when there's a church of Kingdom Builders who are committed to to expressing that good news by meeting the needs of our community community and even if the work might seem ordinary or difficult or just straight up impossible we're believing that starting this God will work through it and do the impossible and the miraculous worship team you can come on up before you count yourself out though because I know some of yall like I a for me the only two qualities that act six highlights about Stephen when he was picked for his role was that he was full of faith and full of the Holy Spirit and because he walked in faith and because he was led by the spirit he knew that as long long as he was sharing the good news and expressing that by meeting the needs of others no matter what role he played and how we would accomplish that he knew that God will still use it to build his kingdom because when you are full of faith and full of God's spirit you are not task driven you are missionally driven meaning that whatever I got to do God to see your kingdom come and your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven I'll do it if I got to serve coffee I'm going serve coffee if I got to lead a small grp I'm going lead a small group if I got to greet people because I know that as long as I'm doing your work you will use it to do the miraculous this is why being full of faith in the spirit is crucial but here's the good news for us all as followers of Jesus we all have that it's only by faith in Christ that we're able to have relationship with them and the Bible says that all who have relationship with Christ have the spirit of God living in them the same spirit that raised him from the dead lives in us but the depth of how you will allow your faith in God's spirit to lead you to do Mighty works for his kingdom will depend on you the reason why I love acts 6 and the life of stepen is that it's a reminder for us that when it comes to God's Great rescue plan for Humanity we all have a role to play God did it for me and I'm I'm awesome but he's like hey I did it for you now we got work to do we all have a role to play and whatever role we find ourselves in it's an opportunity to share God's word and meet the needs of the people around you this is true in your life in the spaces you find yourself whether it's home work or school but this is also true in the role you play of of being a part of the body the church so I ask you that today you would partner with us and seeing God's kingdom grow maybe it's not all City youth but would you find a need and would you feel it as we partner as a church doing God's work together why don't we all stand if we want to see God do the miraculous of bringing good news to the poor if we want to see him do the miraculous of bringing healing for the broken freedom for the captive and justice for the oppressed we need to a church of Kingdom Builders full of faith and empowered by the Holy Spirit to stand in the Gap willing to do both the ordinary things and the difficult things because if act 6 teaches us anything it's that God never uses Clean Hands to perform a miracle we're going to have to get dirty these altars are open if you need prayer today but as we sing this last song let's spend some time asking God how we how he might be wanting us to stand in the Gap as we look to fill the need for the community around us thank you [Music]", "all right so once again please join us for the Justice Conference this upcoming Saturday register on Church Center app it's free we just want to know that you're coming um we're going to continue on our journey through the book of Acts and I will be attempting throughout this journey to connect some of the early part of Acts to the later parts of acts as an example of how it is that we're supposed to fulfill the mission of Jesus today right now 2023 in Massachusetts there's a guy named Peter Peter is one of the early followers of Jesus and he'll be front and center in the story but Peter was a guy that followed Jesus and then abandoned Jesus he that's not a good word he abandoned Jesus and then he denied Jesus and then after Jesus resurrected from the dead Jesus sought Peter out to restore him to forgive him to embrace him back in and there's something powerful when you are forgiven by Jesus and restored by Jesus it's game on from that point on it's like there's something unique and special in that moment Acts chapter 5 verse 12. the apostles were performing many miraculous signs and wonders among the people and all the Believers were meeting regularly at the temple in the area known as Solomon's Colonnade but no one else dared join them even though all the people had high regard for them yet more and more people believed somebody say more and more more and more people believe and were brought to the Lord crowds of both men and women as a result of the Apostles work watch this sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that Peter's shadow might fall across some of them as he went by crowds came from The Villages around Jerusalem bringing their sick and those possessed by evil spirits and they were all healed get this this takes place in the same time period that we are today which is after Jesus ascended to heaven so the healings and all the after Jesus ascends moments the Miracles are happening and miracles could still happen Miracles still happen today just like they did did back then there's no prohibition against God moving today and I think that the Miracles still happen to those that are properly prepared positioned and postured for them to occur in everyday life healings and miracles were occurring all over the place as the apostles were going around and the followers of Jesus were like a wildfire spreading through the villages and this is important because I'm sure that there were some that thought after Jesus ascended to Heaven well it's all over now what are we going to do but now they find out that Jesus ascended so that his mission could expand further and that his followers are to be part of that mission healings and miracles occurring the ministry of Jesus was not finished and in fact it was continuing through his servants in a greater way can we talk about this today seriously can we talk about this today what's the lead up what's the setup and I really want to know what's the setup to this Shadow healing moment for real Shadow healing that's that's a new one right we haven't seen a lot of Shadow healing in the Bible up to this point Shadow healing with Peter that's kind of a Next Level right there in fact maybe this afternoon we can go outside and practice right walking in the sun you know man that's next though I I look for it forward to that moment that's a great moment but I want to know what's kind of the setup to that move of God what's the setup what are the things that are happening to get to that point the first one is this faith has been growing in the area Faith the faith of the people more it says more and more people believed so their faith was growing maybe you've been to one of these big stadiums where maybe the Celtics or the Bruins or the the Patriots uh we have a soccer team right what's that called never mind never mind I'm teasing the uh um but when you go well not the first time I ever went to a professional sporting event all I wanted to do was the wave I'm like 14 years old looking for the wave when's the grave coming you know more it was more important to me than like the game the White Sox I was at the White Sox White Sox game that I was that I was watching and so every once in a while stand up like kind of hoping people would get the hit maybe it's time to do the wave but finally some guy like I'm crazy guy just losing his mind doesn't and then like but if it's just one guy doing it it's just like a guy doing stretches in public it doesn't matter but if a couple more people come and a couple more people come and pretty soon the wave comes around the stadium and it's kind of it's fun and awesome but somebody has to start it and somebody else has to join in to help spread the word and to make it happen right so like if the Celtics are playing and it's getting close and somebody in the crowd starts chanting defense defense defense but it's just one person it's annoying but there's a few dozen people join in it moves from a weird curiosity to something you you should join and then a hundred and the whole place is on board and the fans start to believe that the defense is going to happen they're going to have a turn forced turnover and it infects the team and the team believes they can do it and the belief becomes so contagious that even the opponent now believes that they're going to be stopped it's kind of the present reality of like faith in everyday life but when more people believe more faith is released and when more faith is released more people believe that's how it works now these ideas are all really unimportant the the games that that we're talking about it's not the real it's not the important deal I was waiting for somebody okay I was waiting for somebody you missed the moment it was 30 seconds ago that was the moment okay yeah gotta go to it at the right time but when your faith when your faith is in the god of creation the savior of the world the one who was the one who is and the one who will be the one who found you when you were lost the one who rescues you when you are grieving the one who binds up the Brokenhearted the one who gives hope to the Hopeless Emmanuel God With Us Jesus Christ Christus Victor you've got someone to have faith in that makes a real change a real difference with real hope real love and real faith that's different when you have the real thing to have faith in it's different well you don't need the wave and you don't need a defense chant because you got real faith so that's one thing the faith was increasing the second was set up to this miraculous move of God that they were experiencing um that and now is the proclamation of Jesus there's no doubt to those who were listening to why Peter has so much power and authority wherever he would go he would teach people about Jesus because friends it's always about Jesus it's always about Jesus in front of the people he would declare Jesus to be the long-awaited Messiah sent into the world not to condemn the world but to rescue them to rescue us from our sinful ways even in front of a group of skeptical religious leaders Peter boldly declared of leaders he boldly declared at risk of his own safety there is salvation in no one else God has given no other name under Heaven by which we must be saved it's Jesus and Jesus only since he's saying hey guys get on the Jade train because the Train's leaving the station come on let's go Peter made sure that when he spoke the people he was speaking to could understand what he was saying and clearly to the onlookers and the hearers Jesus was everything to Peter it's all that mattered Jesus was the way the truth and the life Peter knew it and Peter couldn't keep his mouth shut someone you can't keep your mouth shut let's make sure it's about Jesus and it'll be okay [Music] so now now now we're going to turn a corner here what's where'd the power come from the third setup to the move of God is this comes from Acts chapter 4 verse 29. there's a prayer here for boldness courage and Power and now Lord hear their threats and give us your servants great boldness in preaching your word stretch out your hand with healing power May miraculous signs and wonders be done through your name of your holy servant Jesus after the servant after this prayer the meeting place Shook and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit then they preached the word of God with boldness notice the prayer remember they're being persecuted people want them dead people want them gone people want them out of there they had enemies notice they did not pray for the persecution to stop the American church needs to learn something from that they did not pray for those persecuting them to be struck down by a plague and die miserable horrible deaths they did not ask to be taken or sent somewhere else instead they prayed for boldness they prayed for miraculous signs and wonders why they did it so that the people that were trying to hurt them imprisoned them and kill them would be rescued they prayed that way so that the world what the world would view as enemies so that their enemies would be saved so that their enemies would believe so if their enemies could find Jesus why because they didn't view them as their enemies because people are never our enemies no person no matter how much you hate them is your enemy the devil and his minions they are your enemies people that are serving the devil in his minions they are captives in need of being rescued they are deceived and need to have the blinders of their life lifted they are captive with chains on them that need to be freed and if you get it wrong you will view that person as your enemy when they're a captive and you will keep them in captivity because of our unwillingness to pray a prayer like the one we just prayed this ensured because of this prayer this ensured the opposition translated into one of the greatest revivals in history they determine that their freedoms and comfort were irrelevant they determined that their Earthly retirement plans were not as important as their Heavenly retirement plans because after all they would likely be killed before they got a chance to use the money anyhow they determined that their safety didn't matter and the only thing that mattered was that the unrighteous rule of Satan on the Earth would be crushed underneath their feet that the war we faced would be one even if it cost them their law their Earthly lives because God doesn't call us to be safe he calls us to be bold he calls us to be courageous the president of the international Justice Mission says it like this God is asking you this question do you want to be safe or do you want to be brave because you can't be both so as they were praying for boldness and courage and Power notice what happens they were filled with the Holy Spirit they were filled with the Holy Spirit now that that should sound familiar to you because last week we read in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 it says but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you they're being filled with the Holy Spirit in Acts 1 8 and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere Jerusalem throughout Judea Samaria to the ends of the Earth I want you to see on the screen being filled with the Holy Spirit acts 1 8 and acts 4 31 are connected how is this all happening with Peter the it's these two things it's these two things and these these things being filled with the Holy Spirit comes with the reason it comes with power it comes with prayer there's connections there's power happening there's prayer happening involved and there's purpose there's a purpose for it all all pointing all of it points outward toward to continue the mission of Jesus the infilling of the holy spirit is always about continuing the mission of Jesus in our life and in the lives of others which is what it's preaching good news to the poor healing for the broken freeing the captives and bringing Justice to the oppressed that's what it is now that's what it's always been that's what it always will be anything outside those boundaries is missing the point and that's how you end up watch this that's how you end up with Shadow miracles right there shot of Miracles if anybody starts experiencing shot of Miracles I want to know about it okay all right just just to be clear uh now we're gonna I want you to pay attention to this it says in verse 15 sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that Peter's Shadow might fall across some of them as he went by I want you to know this as we complete the rest of this today I want you to remember you don't know the struggle or the journey that another person has been on you don't know you don't know what it took them to get here today you don't know how many obstacles the devil threw in their way right you don't know how much they didn't want to go on with life last night or Friday or Thursday or Wednesday or Tuesday you don't know how much rent they got back do you don't know what the elector you don't know how discouraged they are and you don't know that they're a rock star superstar hero for even being here today you don't know you just don't know you might think you know well you don't know remember that because The Shadow of Your Life matters I'm going to help you with a shadow miracle today The Shadow of Your Life matters because your Shadow can Inspire that other person that you don't know what they're going through but your literal physical presence matters because if you're making it maybe they can make it too the work of God in your life is an inspiration to others and you don't really know how long your Shadow is most of the time because you're just doing your thing you're just walking down the street you're just going to work living your life Your Shadow you see is unintentional it just happens when the Sun hits you there is a shadow that is cast based on your size when the Son of God hits you you have a shadow based on your willingness to let him use you The Shadow of Your Life does not talk it simply is The Shadow of Your Life is your legacy it's your influence it's true it's just true one writer wrote your actions speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you are saying it's talking really about your Shadow of Your Life it can't be manipulated to be what you wish it had been it just is what you are Your Shadow is determined by the position you are to the Sun and your spiritual Shadow is determined by the position you are to the son of God as the worship team comes up there was a man who had lived a very Wicked life and in his final moments on his deathbed he prayed knowing that he was a guilty bad influence he prayed this prayer that my bad influence oh God that my bad influence would be gathered up and buried with me the petition was in vain he passed away but his influence remained behind him because you can't just pray your bad influence away you do have a shadow for good or bad you have a shadow and you can throw shade or you can be shade you can hurt or you can heal you can be a place of damage or you can be a place of restoration there is a tree out there called the men uh manchineal tree that provides soothing shade from the heat of the Sun but it's poison the tree is and the sap that oozes out of the tree is damaging to humans now people who are unaware of it often sit under the tree for Relief and end up with swollen faces or hands and some people even die from the sap on this tree two lessons here don't let your shadow poison others don't be a poison tree second [Music] don't sit underneath the influence of those who will poison your life or poison your faith don't sit in that shade get out from underneath it the idea here is that you and I you're supposed to be a tree a tree of life [Music] a tree of life that provides the kind of shade that is restful and restoring let's be the type of a church and the type of people who cast a long shadow of Hope and a long shadow of healing in Jesus name would you stand with me as we close [Music] [Music] well I do have a shadow in the lights up here look at that [Music] friends we're gonna the worship team's gonna lead us in a moment to give you a chance to respond but I want I want each and every one of us today to be open to praying prayers that challenge us to pray for boldness and courage and opportunities to serve the people that you might right now think are your enemies and when you pray those kind of prayers watch watch this watch how you will be filled with the Holy Spirit watch how he will rush in and give you the courage and strength to do that take you to the next level and so we're praying that today for you pray that your shadow your legacy your influence would be that of one that is filled with hope and filled with healing and today the altars are open and this is a time for you to talk to God about this to talk to Jesus about this and if you're here today and you just need a touch from God like you just kind of barely stumbled in here today you need God to touch you it's okay to come and ask God to do a work in your life today let's do that together the authors are over let's come and pray today [Music] foreign", "all right we're going to get to that in a second Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid the uh a couple of things first uh this Monday or I guess that's tomorrow is the one year anniversary of our AAA meeting over at the Mansion for our ladies so congratulations on that one year so keep keep moving forward keep moving forward with that uh you all received on the way in a little flyer like this talked about our Justice Conference coming up on October 29th you heard it in the announcements just want to pause and say this is a very important thing for you to come to it's the kind of thing that you adjust your schedule to come to uh that you you if you were going to do something do this instead it's that kind of thing we've been talking about it for a while that's extremely important biblical Justice racial reconciliation and Community Development from a Christian uh world view these are extremely important things that our church is positioned to do something about we can actually assist ourselves and our cities in moving forward in these areas and it's something that we absolutely need to take the mantle of and run forward with and so uh we're we're going to be launching this Justice Conference October 29th so that's a Saturday so come on out for that okay tell your neighbor's gonna be okay it's gonna be okay maybe you don't believe me um for some of you it actually might not be okay uh today but we're walking on out in our walk on out search today we're going to be walking on out from Financial worries and debt we're walking on out of debt okay Ron blue he was a a long time Financial uh Christian Guru uh in the financial world he says this getting into debt is as easy as getting down an ice covered Mountain getting out of debt is just as difficult as climbing that same Mountain it's slippery going back out so maybe some of you today are climbing out of a mountain of debt at the moment actually I know that the vast majority of you are climate trying to get out of debt eighty percent on average 80 percent of people are in debt and you're not the only ones on average Americans have a significant debt that you can find in a lot of different places but our source today says that credit card debt on average in America is 5200 a person personal loans at seventeen thousand dollars this is a new category by the way I mean it's not truly new but you know those things that come in the mail that say hey you're eligible for a loan I had no idea I'll just take this loan out and go to dunks a lot this week okay that's that's what's going on okay uh you know personal loans auto loans are it's actually more than this now but 21 000 student loans are 39 500 on average home equity loans these are the loans you take out against your house that you're supposed to use for home renovations and things like that that you actually use to do something else with okay that turns it into real regular debt or Consumer Debt home equity loans at thirty nine thousand five hundred on average on average these are average numbers that's not even counting mortgages it's not counting subscriptions it's not counting all these other ways that are out there the video we showed was dated obviously but it said that in 2007 the Consumer Debt in America was 2.5 trillion dollars you know that you don't even know what a trillion means I don't know what a trillion means all I know is it's an enormous number that none of us can get our head around but you know that it's not accurate anymore we don't have 2.5 trillion dollars in Consumer Debt in America today we have 16.5 trillion dollars in Consumer Debt think about that from 2007 to today that's a huge jump in Consumer Debt we're not even talking about a nation's debt talking about our debt hundreds of thousands of Americans file for bankruptcy every year eighty percent of us owe more than we own the Bible says in Proverbs chapter 22 just as the rich rule the poor say that again as the rich rule the poor so the borrower is servant to the lender and although the Bible does not prohibit borrowing money it does give special warning against letting debt get out of hand in your life debt if used should be used to lever forward to leverage something forward in your life not to live day to day so if you're going into debt to live it's a problem the reason for the scriptures warning about debt is because God does not want us to be a servant or a slave to anything by him not to serve other things or to serve God First Corinthians 7 says you are bought with a price so don't be the Servants of men the scripture is loaded with warnings about a lot of things but it is particularly loaded with warnings about money to be careful with money be careful with debt be careful with these things be careful not to let money Master you you can't be you can't serve both God and money you can only have one master as Christians we need to be weary of following anything or allowing anything even debt to keep us from being free to do whatever it is that God wants us to do in our lives if God says I need you to go over there right now and your answer is I can't afford to oh that's a problem because you're in debt and you can't do the thing that God wants you to do that God's created you to do that God is uniquely designed you from before the foundations of the earth to do and debt is getting in the way there's a book called nine steps to Financial Freedom Susie Orman wrote it she said debt feels like the heaviest burden of life it weighs down your spirits keeps your mind occupied have you ever thought about the debt that you have like it's a you're having anxiety right now just because I'm talking about debt it makes you feel bound because you are bound that sounds like prison because it is it's a form of prison it's something that we need to walk on out of to walk on out of debt and watch out walk on out of financial worry so this morning if you are burdened with indebtedness I want you to see how you can begin to get out of financial debt we're not going into a series we're not this is just a One-Shot quick overview today and there's a couple of things I want you to just pay attention to in the church Center app you can go to the more

it's absolutely free and extremely helpful and if you aren't any debt at all please go to moneycanvas.com and schedule an appointment it is totally free and they won't sell you anything um there's a lot of wisdom and instruction in the Bible about how to handle money we're not going to get to all of it just a quick overview three-step strategy today built on biblical principles for getting out of debt one the first step in strategy to battling debt is to identify the reasons that you're in debt to begin with how did you get into debt you know you don't want to go into debt how did you get there identify the reasons so you can present yourself prevent yourself from getting deeper into debt in the future there's basically three reasons that we all get into debt humans are a lot alike each other first we want instant gratification somebody say instant gratification we just want it now we want it right now right now we don't want to wait we don't want to wait Luke chapter 15 we read the story where Jesus tells the story of a parable of the prodigal son who went to his father demanded that his father paying him in his inheritance now instead of later he says in verse 12 father give me my share of the estate now somebody say now now now I want to right now instead of letting it build and grow and do a massive amount of wealth when you retire I want it right now so I will be poor and broke for the rest of my life that's what he wants to do with it his father gave him the money today not when he was older and he spent it all and we're just like that so often it's kind of in our Brokenness in our broken Fallen Humanity we just want all the good stuff right now regardless of the cost regardless of the consequence even when we can't afford it we want that we go into debt to meet our desire for stuff we go into debt to go to dunks or Starbucks we go into debt to travel or go on vacation you know we go into debt to go to Disney World or we go into debt to give the kids this thing or that thing do you know why we're talking about this today in October why are we talking about not going into debt in October because the Christmas is coming up and that Amazon devil already got BBB beat they start October 11th and 12th some of you already fell into the Trap it went into massive amounts of debt to give your kids and other people stuff that they don't want anyhow they will never remember I mean it's going to be coming it's coming already you can feel it coming as soon as the election season is done boom it's just going to be one commercial after another telling you to go into debt it's rough I'm going to tell you right now you don't have to go into debt you shouldn't go into debt and if you're already in debt you don't have to give anybody anything for real not your husband not your kids notice I didn't say your wife not your husband not your kids [Applause] I mean you could write a heartfelt note but it better have something on it you can make it if you have to carve it out of a tree but you don't have to but years ago my sisters and I we looked at each other and said we don't need anything there's nothing I need why do I need a 20 or 30 gift from you and why do I need to give you a 20 or 30 or 40 gift you don't need it I don't need it I really don't even want most of the stuff it gets traveled home and I forget about it and I don't even remember what it was so how about we don't give each other anything they're like let's do that that's the best Christmas gift we ever gave anybody it's not giving anything it was amazing I'm like the Grinch that stole Christmas up here today you don't need to give me anything get out of debt listen don't go into death for all that stuff listen today I can travel anywhere I want I can go on vacation basically I can do whatever I want at this point in my financial life but you know what I couldn't have said that 10 years ago because I wasn't in a financial place to make that statement people would find out somehow that we didn't have cable television and they'd find out because they'd say hey did you see this I'm like no I don't have cable you don't have cable it was like saying we don't drink water right or breathe and my wife would always respond oh we don't have because we want to go on vacation and if you do the math you can pick one or the other also I'm 52 years old and I've been wise with money for a long time so I can do things today in my financial life that I couldn't do before and there's a journey and notice the long time piece of that for a long time just because somebody else does something doesn't mean you have to do it the iPhone 76 you don't have to have like okay I can get the 15 then or the 14 or whatever it is now so we've made financial decisions earlier that we benefit from today by taming the desire for instant gratification tame the desire for instant gratification the now the immediate second reason that we tend to go into debt is not anticipating hard times many of us have gotten into debt because we acted like hard times and trouble couldn't possibly happen to me and then the entire world learned at the exact same moment that anything can happen to anybody at the exact same moment the pandemic hits we all discover that economic hard times are possible for anybody we spent our money assuming that economic conditions and life circumstances will remain stable and we have presumed upon the future even though every person is no less than five years away from something tragic happening in their life that is the nature of living in a broken and Fallen World and sometimes we might not sometimes we must plan for the future sometimes we don't because we think well it's all just going to work out or we layer in some weird theological stuff like well God will provide it'll be okay well let me think let me push into that just a minute if you mean by God will provide I can do whatever I want now with no concern for the future because God will just take care of me then that's incorrect that's incorrect but if you mean I can take the resources God gives me today and be wise with them in the present so that the future is more secure then yes it does mean that but the scripture tells us something about this it tells us to look at ants so interesting Bible tells us to look at ants what do ants do it says this Proverbs 6. take a lesson from the ants you lazy bones learn from their ways and become wise the Bible's calling you lazy bones not me okay just making sure we got that though they have no Prince or Governor or ruler to make them work they labor hard all summer Gathering food for the winter they're prepared why because Winter's always coming two months from now when you're paying your gas bill you will be reminded winter is always coming and if you're thinking to yourself I can't believe how high gas prices are gas prices are always high sometimes they're higher sometimes there's not as high but in the winter your heating bill is always more expensive because winter is always coming but you lazy bones how long will you sleep when will you wake up a little extra sleep a little more Slumber a little folding of the hands to rest then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit scarcity will attack you like an armed robber oh basically prepare for the next season prepare for the future save up store up the truth of scripture is that we don't know for certain not for certain what tomorrow will bring Proverbs 27 says don't brag about tomorrow since you don't know what the day will bring frankly some of us are out there spending like there is going to be no tomorrow spend spend spend no caution you're spending on whatever you want your daughter needs braces now and you don't have any money until you have to borrow because you didn't have anything set aside for a rainy day or emergency fund or for things that are obviously going to happen so that's another reason we go into debt it's okay I love you everybody it's fine Thea we're going to get there verse number three third thing we need to pay attention to spending more than our resources allow basically not living within our income listen if you make this much money okay if you make this much money then you have to spend less than that much money I mean I just gave you like earth-shattering advice there I know right right but but that's that's if you're like but Pastor Kurt I have more expenses than what I make exactly exactly you have to live underneath that and you're like but I can't you have to yeah so you have to make some hard choices what does it mean maybe you have to figure out how to get this number up or to get your expenses down that's just hard that's just real talk that's just what it is at in our in our world Ecclesiastes chapter 5 says this the more you have the more people come to help you spend it so what good is wealth except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers I think the author there was a little frustrated about all his kids wanting to spend his money is what's happening there but most of us have spent money like you get a raise and you think oh I can spend more money now isn't that interesting that's what we do with it like you get a 35 an hour raise you're like man I can spend a dollar more an hour now you know it just somehow manages to be that it's the money comes in and then it goes out it means immediately one author said The more you have the more you spend and it's so true we immediately began spending more thinking oh I can afford it now so the first step in battling debt is to identify the reasons you're in debt so it's one of those three reasons and it's most likely that you fall into one or all those categories that I've mentioned but once you know why you have gotten into debt perhaps you can then put an end to those damaging behaviors you can start to tackle them head on because debt is more behavioral than it is financial and so in order to get out of debt we have to stop the behaviors that lead to more debt you got to stop those behaviors now number one acknowledge the debt somebody say acknowledge acknowledge it the second that step in today's strategy to walk out of debt and financial worries is to acknowledge the bondage of your situation acknowledge your present reality some of us are still in denial about our situation and are honestly just not ready to change but to make forward progress you must acknowledge and admit that there is a problem that it needs to change the Bible says this that when we admit our problems we begin to release the bondage that those problems have on us it's a bondage and it can't be released until you acknowledge it Jeremiah 3 God says this acknowledge your guilt admit that you rebelled against the Lord your God admit it why because it invites God into your scenario when you acknowledge it admit it God can come in and help you God can come in and rescue you it begins with being brutally honest acknowledging and admitting to yourself and to God Rick Warren gave six indicators to help you identify if you might have a problem with debt okay so just pay attention to these indicators and ask yourself is that me am I wrestling with this one or that one or all of them indicator number one you're living on credit meaning if you have to depend on your credit cards each month to maintain your lifestyle you're probably in trouble with debt indicator 2 if you're delaying payments or paying the minimum that you owe if you're missing payments making a late payment if you find yourself bouncing checks or withdrawing money out of Reserve accounts that were for something else to pay today's bills then you're struggling with debt number three your Consumer Debt is more than 20 percent of your net monthly income now that's a kind of a math number right there right but if if you're paying more than 20 percent you're not going to be able to stay out of debt long term indicator 4. if you are unable to tithe or save you're not giving back to God it's a sign that you're spending too much here's something for you I believe that all True Believers want to be wildly generous but many people have found themselves trapped in a debt cycle they're living on the margins and end up not doing the thing that they actually want to do so walking on out of debt releases you to be the generous person that you already want to be because there are frequently times when you want to do something and you can't because your master tells you you can't because your master is dead number five you spend money on extravagant items someone say extravagant extravagant items what does extravagant mean well maybe it's different things to different people having expensive taste when you can't afford it is a sign that you are vulnerable to debt we have funny Expressions that give ourselves away here's one you might say to yourself or tell your your friend you're worth it you're worth it I don't know if I should get this your friend's like you're worth it I am worth it I think I'm gonna get this is great it looks good I am worth this it's true you're worth but you're actually worth a lot more than that well here's one you do to yourself and it's not just your friends that do it too this is a tough week I'm going to treat myself I I'm gonna treat myself what kind of foolish what kind of so many foolish things that we say to lie and deceive ourselves to going into debt do you deserve a treat yes absolutely but if you're in debt don't do it so you can give the treat of being out of debt to yourself that would be a much better treat number six it's gonna get worse from here number six you're always looking for get rich quick ideas or schemes let's just have an honest conversation for a minute I cannot walk down the streets of Lynn without being assaulted by thousands of scratch tickets everywhere what is happening what is happening is people are looking we are looking for get rich quick schemes scratch tickets Lottery casinos you know the whole thing anything that's gambling anything like schemes and far-fetched ideas of making money oh my goodness stop them the worst thing you can do is to win on a scratch ticket because then you'll think there's like some kind of gambling genius all right that the the favor of the Lord is upon you to win in the scratch this is all alive from the devil okay it's state it's government sanctioned Injustice on the poor is what it is okay so you need to understand that's the devil that is not to God you win and you're like praising the Lord for it that was the devil it wasn't Jesus I'm enough with that okay I don't know why people want to be poor so bad if you're already in debt don't make it worse by getting involved with these schemes you're always dreaming up these fancy things that oftentimes are just strategies and schemes and stares of the devil and if that's your situation you're probably already in debt or on the verge of debt or hoping that this is your way out of debt when it really just makes you go further into debt Proverbs 21 does this steady plotting brings prosperity you want to be prosperous you want to be wealthy you want to get out of poverty steady plotting brings Prosperity but Hasty speculation brings poverty that's Bible now let me ask you did you answer yes to any of those things is one of them you two of them six of them if you did then you're probably struggling with debt right now or highly vulnerable to it and perhaps today you simply need to acknowledge your reality and make a commitment to change your situation as soon as possible admit the challenge begin to change and maybe we need to delete that section of the video so that I don't get a call from the state of Massachusetts wondering why everything all their income just went down okay all right okay so so in third third we need to commit to becoming debt free that brings us to this step commit to becoming debt free now somebody say now do it now don't wait till January 1st do it now so you'll have the process in place before Christmas season starts the worst thing you can do is to procrastinate and allow your financial situation to get worse start today make a plan become debt free and get control of your finances but you got to have a plan so moneycanvas.com or download the spending plan that we put in the church Center app Proverbs 21 5 says this good planning and hard work lead to prosperity good planning so I said good planning planning all right as my friend Scott comes up why don't you welcome Scott who's going to come up here today [Applause] [Music] all right come on over here Scott now a few weeks ago Scott comes into church and he is like rolling on cloud nine okay he's just he he is just flying high that day I'm like what's going on he goes Pastor Kurt you'll never believe it I'm finally out of debt okay [Applause] all right so totally debt free totally debt free it's a really big deal an accomplishment and so Scott introduce yourself uh first off and how how was it in the first place that you got into debt well I was stupid I was stupid I think I saw that in the Bible also okay good good good and what kind of like you said I am I well I get a fixed income no and I had six credit cards out the time six credit cards and all right like credit card on on stuff that like helped you or or what kind of stuff did you maybe I don't want to answer that question never mind I don't want to answer that question never mind I don't know the answer to that question so I'm not asking it okay so um okay so you're spending it on stuff we talked earlier uh spending on stuff just whatever stuff when you're young right you said you were young and stupid yeah I never imagined that being young and stupid so you found yourself in debt you couldn't uh you were in trouble so so you eventually got out of debt so how did you how did you get out of debt um well I have a PhD that helped me kinda think too about that and then I had all these feelings that I'll be attracted not being able to do anything so the feeling of bondage or being trapped your hands tied behind your back you said before the uh you had somebody that helped you uh and you were accountable with and you made a plan okay he made a budget and he followed a budget here's the bigger wait for it everybody so Scott you were in quite a bit of debt we don't need to know how much but how long how long did it take you following this plan to get out of debt 20 on the end more than 20 years some of you just gave up right there I mean like I'm I'm not I can't do this the 20th 20 years to get out of debt if you're in debt today that's actually encouraging it means you can get out of debt it might take you longer than you want but if you keep at it you can get there how does it make you feel today to be out of debt yeah oh my God if there was a miracle I would say this is one difficult definition [Applause] thank you Scott I want you all to hear that from Scott um we all need to hear that it's possible it's possible to get out of debt and when you're inviting God into it uh he helps you with it and sometimes the Miracles patience I think one step at a time one step at a time Next Step start by giving to God like well what didn't you just say stop letting money out and now you're out of saying give this doesn't make any sense well a major problem behind our debt is not just behavioral it's also spiritual and sometimes our priorities are out of whack and we need to involve God in this even if you can't see how you can give to God that's what where the faith component comes in now if you've been around the Bible at all some of you are new to the Bible is Brandon brand new to you and you don't know this others you've been around a long time with it and you know that there's this thing called tithing there's actually two categories in the Bible uh there's the tithing and then there is offerings tithing is 10 of our income that's pre-designated by God to go into the storehouse or your local church offering is what you give beyond that to whatever it is that you feel compelled by God to give to two categories now you might think this is a little bit contrary to logic and some of the stuff you're talking about but making a commitment to give back to God you are saying God my priorities are changing I'm giving you control of my finances again here we go we can't have two masters we can have one you can't serve both God and money and so when we don't do what God wants us to do we reveal our real master and that's that's the issue so this is about trust and trust in God inviting God in Malachi chapter 3 tells us that when we give back to God He blesses us and if we want out of debt we're going to have we're going to need God's blessing more than anything so if you're thinking to yourself are you kidding me 10 percent this is not a gotcha moment it's not this is a trust God moment but if you've never tithed before it's new and I would encourage you just get started like start the process of learning to give and to be generous start with one percent if you've never done it before one percent talk to God about it because it might be scary and then a few months later go up to two percent or one point five percent doesn't matter just make progress just move towards God inviting God into your financial situations and every step forward that you make every step spiritual step that you take is a spiritual decision so inviting God into that process so just just make sure that you're doing that as well next determine where you're at getting out of debt requires knowing the total amount of debt that you owe it's very practical but this is something that most people don't actually know if you're in debt today you should know the exact number that you are in debt down to the penny credit card balances mortgage balances installment loan balances car loans personal loans student loans Etc et cetera et cetera write out everything you owe and now we have this sneaky thing called subscriptions I mean 20 years ago I don't remember having these subscriptions except maybe a magazine service or a month of the CD of the month thing something like that but it's got out of control you can spend hundreds of dollars a month on subscriptions if you're not careful but in order to begin to get out of debt we need to know exactly how much we owe Proverbs 27 says this riches can disappear fast and the king's crown doesn't stay in your in his family forever to watch your business interest closely know the state of your flocks and your hurts so we're supposed to watch our finances carefully most of you don't have flocks and herds I haven't heard of any of you owning flocks and herds but if you do please let me know it would be an interesting illustration but flocks and hurts what does that mean that means your business that means your job that means how much you get paid that means whatever skill sets you have what maybe you need to increase your skill sets or develop something new in order to live in this new world that we have and prosper in it at a meeting a few weeks ago with a young man I've known for a lot of years he makes plenty of money plenty most of you would be happy to make it and he should be in a very good financial situation and it was clear to me that something was off and he finally came clean and it turns out he was behind on his car payments like what how are you why do you even have a car payment is what I thought like you make plenty of money then he then I realized as we're talking he's also behind on his house payments he stopped paying his credit card payments months ago and it just got worse from there he was in real financial trouble when I asked how much debt did he actually have he says this to me he goes I honestly don't know he goes because I'm so embarrassed I'm so embarrassed he was this literally loaded with Shame about being in debt because he knew he shouldn't be but this is not about shame this is about freedom and there's no point in beating ourselves up about the past and so he got an assignment from me to go find out exactly what debt and all the interest rates and all that kind of stuff so he could start making progress who can't make forward progress and walk out of debt and walk out of financial worries until you understand where you're really at yeah next stop going into further debt if you want to get out of debt you have to immediately stop going into further debt that's why we're talking about this before Christmas if you're like wow the only way I can not go into further debt is to stop doing some things I like doing then stop doing those things that's that's the point you might need the strength of God to do that Jesus said if you have something causing you to sin cut it off some of us need to cut off our credit cards but some of you would rather cut off your hand than cut off your credit cards if you use your credit cards well like you pay them off in full every single month you live on a budget and you're disciplined this is not apply to you but if you are paying the minimum only because you love to spend and buy stuff then cut those things up remove the credit card you're like okay I can do that I'm not done yet remove the credit card information from your Google pay or Apple pay and your online shopping accounts unsubscribe from everything you possibly can right your credit card information is out there all over the place they make it easier and easier to go into debt why because they want you to be their slave that's what debt's about next develop a repayment plan Psalm 37 says the wicked borrower do not replay so we must learn to begin to repay what we owe and do it as soon as possible in Ron Blue's book taming the money monster he says you get out of debt little by little over time and the major requirement is discipline it takes discipline to do this and yes there are times when drastic measures need to be taken like Selling Stuff selling your assets the sale of things that you like like maybe your car or your motorcycles or your computers or your Investments or or your homes are are the first things that you can look at determine which items you can do without and start to get rid of those things and sell them that seems like a pretty harsh way to deal with this but if you want to get out of debt a thing that puts you in servanthood and slavery then there are some things that might need to take place second Kings chapter 4 says now sell the olive oil and pay your debts and your sons can live on what you and your sons can live on what's left over in other words liquidate extra assets and cut out the debt in your life 22 years ago my wife and I made the decision if we were ever going to be able to Pastor a church in the city we would not get paid a lot of money and we needed to get out of all debt so we started selling everything we sold things that we had we looked around to find things and we sold it I sold all of my college textbooks many of them I sold for more than what I bought them for so that was a pretty good deal I sold all the collections that I had had for years if it had value to it we sold it we made changes in our lifestyle and step by step we got there over a period of time and just for fun right at the end of this lengthy out of debt process we had a thousand dollars in debt left to tackle and right at that moment we received a one thousand dollar check from a very unexpected source and with it we pay it off the very last of our debt it was kind of like God was winking at us like way to go way to go that's there you go we're going to finish it up now it took time it took effort it took discipline and it took faith and I know what many of you are thinking right now oh this is the sermon where we get to ask God to send us Anonymous checks in the mail that's not what this is okay you're like oh but God you gave Pastor Kurt a thousand dollar check and that's what I need right now well don't forget the first part all the other stuff that we were involved with we got out of debt so that we could do what God wanted us to do and that's the real Point as the worship team comes up let me give one more recommendation about getting out of debt don't quit somebody say don't quit say it again now tell your neighbor don't quit listen I know some of you many of you have tried to get out of debt hundreds of times you say to yourself every credit card statement I am going to get out of debt I'm never going to get into debt again listen don't quit don't put off doing this six months until six months from now because you can start today the best time to make any improvements whether Financial or anything is right now make that commitment today and watch how God begins to provide Galatians chapter 6 says this let us not get tired of doing what is right for after a while we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up so don't give up keep on trying getting out of debt is not easy it takes patience perseverance and a willingness to sacrifice but with God's help you can do it just don't give up why don't you stand with me [Music] a little different kind of a Sunday morning the

started for for those of you who don't know me I want to just introduce some pictures of my family on our last vacation pretty awesome uh my wife Pastor Emily I'm not jail and we actually were able to go to Philadelphia and go up the Rocky Steps and I think I was the only one that was having Nostalgia because I've actually seen the movie but it was great she went up uh the steps all by herself and it was an awesome time so I've been doing a lot of cool trips during the summer and one of the things that I've also been doing a lot has been doing some camping so we're actually camping near a Philadelphia and we just actually got back from a retreat as well like a church camping retreat which was awesome by the way like it rained a large part of the time and you know and I love that by the way I know that you know Pastor Tanisha feels differently about that but I I love the rain and I love the soothing sound of rain it's like a sound machine but sounds are real and I was able to just you know enjoy a great time with those uh that were able to go and there's some things that I've learned about camping this summer and the fact that there are Essentials if you've never gone there are essential things that you want to know and that you want to have first of all you want to have some information like is it going to rain second of all like you want to see what the amenities are like first of all where's the closest gas station where are you know the closest restrooms is they're running water you want to know all these things because you don't want to have to figure out when you get there and you know what are the campground rules and all of that but there are other Essentials as well that you want to bring with you and you need the right shoes for example you need the right clothes the right supplies I have here a few supplies that are essential you need a good flashlight right you want to be able to see where you're going I have some bug spray gotta have bug spray if you're going to go camping some rope that I think you know is turned out to be very essential on our last trip but here's here's something that's very essential that can be the difference between a really bad a really bad vacation or really good vacation because it turns out that if the toddler doesn't you feel comfortable and sleep then nobody Sleeps and everybody feels cranky the next day so you want to have these Essentials so there you go there's some wisdom there for the wise so I wanted to talk to you today about this concept of being well equipped okay being well equipped and when it comes to following Jesus there's a lot of equipping that takes place because when God has called us to something he wants to equip us how many of you know that if God calls you to do something then he wants to equip us and this requires us to live by faith trusting in the good character of God trusting in his promises because that that is what it means to live by faith and it there's another reason why we're being equipped it's because God is equipping us for something in the future there are things that God wants us to do and so if we don't take the opportunity to be equipped when we're going through the equipping part then we'll be we'll be unprepared and it's also important for us to participate in the equipping process because how many of you know you can actually resist what God is trying to do in your life in fact you can actually reject what God is trying to do in your life that makes it complicated for God to do what he wants to do and so right now we're in the middle of a series called let's go and it is a kingdom oriented life that's our topic for today a kingdom oriented life how do we live that kind of life and we're going to backtrack a little bit last week we're in Acts three we're gonna go back to Acts chapter one because there's a significant moment that I want us to look at that happens right after Jesus is killed and then he arises uh from the dead and this is what happens in Acts chapter one it says in my first book I told you Theophilus about everything Jesus began to do and teach until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving his chosen Apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit during the 40 days after he suffered and died he appeared to the apostles from time to time and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive and he talked to them pay close attention he talked to them about the kingdom of God that's what Jesus wanted to talk about once when he was eating with them he commanded them do not leave Jerusalem until the father sends you the gift he promised as I told you before John baptized with water but in just a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit so when the apostles were with Jesus they kept asking Lord has the time come for you to free Israel and restore Our Kingdom so notice What's Happening Here Jesus has just spent three and a half years with this group of of Believers and he's he's been day and night talking to them about the kingdom of God doing the work of the kingdom of God introducing the kingdom of God and then he is killed and then he comes back from the dead doesn't miss a beat and goes right back to talking about the kingdom of God and the next question that he's asked is Lord has the time come for you to free Israel and restore Our Kingdom like Jesus what about us what about what about what we want to do and I love these moments in scripture because they're they're very vulnerable and how many of you uh you know can can relate to this idea of you reading the Bible and you're just glad that you're not the only dense one right you're just glad that these people that were day and night following Jesus they're also not getting it or sometimes they get off track and so Jesus you know he isn't harsh he simply redirects them what he's talking about and he goes back to talking about the kingdom of God and so as followers of Jesus we are called to build the kingdom of God not our own kingdoms not our own will but the kingdom of God and the will of God we are to posture our lives around God's activity and God's purposes and God's Kingdom that's what we are to do as followers of Jesus so over the next few minutes I just want to ask a few questions I want to ask a few questions I want to talk to you about how to how to know if you are in fact living a kingdom-oriented life because Jesus thought it was pretty important of all the things he could have talked to his disciples about in those crucial moments before going back to Heaven he took them back to the kingdom of God and there are some clear markers or some signs that if you're in the kingdom of God this these are characteristics that we should have in our lives so here's the first question am I being transformed by the word of God somebody say transformed this is a very important question am I being transformed by the word of God and you'll see this in early January how many of you know that just because you have a gym membership doesn't mean that you're being transformed amen those who have ears to hear listen to what the spirit is telling you right just because you have that card in your wallet or whatever it doesn't mean that you're actually transformed unless you engage with the process a process of transformation and this is actually one of the ways that we know if we're truly serious about following Jesus if we're truly serious about being in the kingdom of God because notice how it says that Jesus gave his chosen Apostles further instructions it means he had already given them instructions but he had more to say and this means that it is an ongoing process that means that God wants to continually speak to each and every one of us and there's a specific group of people this is not for everybody this is for the Disciples of Jesus this is for you and I and so there's that that further further instructions that God wants to give us and so this willingness to be molded by the instruction of Jesus was to become a marker of maturity among his disciples and why is that well friends because everywhere Jesus went the the crowds would gather around Jesus they wanted to see the Miracles they wanted to hear the stories they wanted to hear the sermons but not everybody was interested in being transformed they were just following the Crowd Oh there's a Crowd Oh Jesus is there I wonder what he's doing today but they were not really interested in going any further than that check this out in Luke 13. it says Jesus went through the towns and Villages teaching as he went always pressing on toward Jerusalem someone asked him Lord will only a few be saved and watch what Jesus responds work hard to enter the narrow door to God's Kingdom for many will try to enter but will fail when the Master of the House has locked the door it will be too late you will stand outside knocking and pleading Lord open the door for us but he will reply I don't know you or where you come from then you will say so this is what their this is their case but we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets and he will reply I tell you I don't know you or where you come from get away from me all you who do evil and it goes on and on but the the idea is that one of the things that that is pointed out in this in this Parable is that casual knowledge of Jesus or close acquaintance with Jesus is not enough to enter the kingdom of God proximity to Jesus is not enough essentially what these people are saying in this Parable is like hey Jesus you preached in our streets that was a great sermon last week Pastor Jesus I was there I heard it I loved it and so they were hearing the words of Jesus it was happening but they were not interested in being transformed they were not interested in actually doing what Jesus was calling them to do but a disciple is someone who allows the word of God to do its work look at John 15 16. Jesus says you didn't choose me I chose you I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit so that the father will give you whatever you ask for using my name so there's a little bit of authority uh or a lot of authority actually that God wants to give us but in order to see the power of God in our lives release the first step is to become a disciple we need to become a disciple of Jesus someone who responds to the the call of God to bear fruit and and this is the difference between someone who's in the crowd and someone who's a disciple is it the disciple is someone who is allowing God to prune them and how many of you know that there are some things in our life that need to be cut off right things like old habits old attitudes old ways of thinking and friends let me tell you this in case you've never heard this Jesus never said to go into all the world and make converts he didn't say go and make subscribers or or club members or viewers or attendees or partners he called us to make disciples and to be disciples we have to be a disciple right he called us he said come follow me and be my disciple and that's still the call that's the call that Jesus has for each one of us and so we're not called to Simply half Church we're called to be the church to this broken world disciples are people who receive instructions from the word of God and that is actually one of the primary tools that God uses to equip us second Timothy 3 16 says all scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us well watch this useful to teach us what is true and make us realize what is wrong in our lives it corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right God uses it so Jesus is going to use his word to prepare and equip his people to do every good work so so follow that process so if you're not responding to the word of God if you're not engaging with the word of God if you're not taking time to get to know the word of God you are missing out on the equipping that the Holy Spirit wants to do in your life because the word of God is how that happens I want to make sure that you hear this today God has not only called you but he has committed himself to equipping you through his word and now there are some things that you know we simply do because Jesus asks us to do them tonight we have baptism right any people getting baptized today we have a few in the room all right give it up to them so baptism is one of those things that we simply do because Jesus has asked us to do this for example check out Acts 2 where a Peter is just preached a powerful message and uh at the end of verse 37 uh the the people are responding to that to that message and they say Brothers what should we do and that's the attitude that we should come to by the way when we come to the word of God what should I do God what do you want me to do and Peter replied each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of your sins then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit so I would encourage you to make room in your life for the word of God and we have Bible studies every Wednesday night seven o'clock right here in this room we have Youth and you know kids programs on site we have a Bible table on your way out of service today so check that out but essentially do what you have to do to get to know the word of God and sometimes there may be Seasons where we get a little distracted but we we come back again to the kingdom of God second question that I want to ask today is am I being sensitive somebody say sensitive to the Holy Spirit am I being sensitive to the Holy Spirit I don't know how many of you that you know during the covet process lost some senses like your sense of smell your taste anybody uh it was it was difficult or have you ever gone through a like a tooth procedure where they they give you anesthesia and you can't you can't feel anything right it's an odd feeling right you're like playing around with yourself it's uh you can't feel anything and it's it's kind of uh kind of interesting when you think about it but you're not able to feel in those moments what you're supposed to be feeling and sometimes that can happen to us when we've been following Jesus for a while Things become familiar right you're going to church you're doing your thing and you're showing up for this group and that group and Jesus becomes familiar and we have to be aware of that in Luke earlier in the first part of his work Luke says in uh seven chapter 7 36 that one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat when a certain immoral woman from that City heard he was there she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume then she knelt behind him at his feet weeping her tears fell on his feet and she wiped them off with her hair then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman is touching him she's a sinner then Jesus answered his thoughts Simon he said to the Pharisee I have something to say to you go ahead teacher Simon replied then Jesus told him a story a man loaned money to two people 500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other but neither of them could repay him so he kindly forgave forgave them both canceling their debt who do you suppose loved him more after that Simon answered I suppose the one for whom he counseled the larger debt that's right Jesus said then he turned to the woman and said to Simon look at this woman kneeling here when I entered your home you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair you didn't greet me with a kiss but from the time I first came in she has not stopped kissing my feet you neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume I tell you her sins and they are many have been forgiven so she has shown me much love but a person who is Forgiven little shows only little love then Jesus said to the woman your sins are forgiven so catch What's Happening Here the the religious leader was simply unmoved by the presence of God and friends when we get to that place we find ourselves being unmoved by the presence of God that should worry us that should concern us because this guy was he was too familiar with Jesus he was open to dialogue with Jesus but he wasn't in tune with what Jesus was doing in the room you see what was happening is there was a Revival happening in that room where Jesus was the power of sin was being broken and strongholds were being destroyed and captives were being set free under right under his nose and and he was oblivious to that this guy totally missed what Jesus was doing and it's important to check our hearts and to have moments to realign ourselves somebody say realign right we have to realign ourselves and you know by the way if you're if you're around this evening you can join us at the baptism service that's one of our realigning moments because it's a time of the year where we remind ourselves what this is all about amen uh everything that we do here is awesome but we're about making disciples and when someone commits their life to Jesus that's a big deal and we have to keep our eyes on that make sure that doesn't that doesn't land on the back burner accidentally number three question number three am I still living an expectation for the power of God am I am I am I living an expectation for the power of God see this is what Jesus uh told them once once in Acts chapter 1 verse 4 Once when he was eating with them he commanded them do not leave Jerusalem until the father sends you the gift he promised as I told you before John baptized with water but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit and so he's inviting them to live an expectation about what God is going to do and uh you know there are a few moments in life that you're filled with with such expectation that you feel like you could explode and for me personally that was when my daughter was born and you know my wife was going through the labor pains and I didn't know what to do with myself I was just you know you feel kind of useless in those moments you're trying to help but you don't really you're not really needed you know but you are but you're not but you're just walking around the the uh the hospital praying or doing something and I just I didn't know what to do with myself and I was filled with expectation I was filled with the expectation of of what was going to happen in a few days in our lives were going to change and that's the kind of expectation that God wants us to be under is is waiting on what God is going to do what what's God going to do today when I go to the store who's he going to have me talk to or you know what is he going to have me do this year like what what challenge are we going to take on uh in the name of Jesus and that kind of expectation because God has promised to equip us with his personal presence and his power that that's this promise for us today there's a Christian quote that says God doesn't call the equipped he equips the cult which means that God has a tendency of taking broken lives ill-equipped people outcasts and Sinners and restoring them and then he repurposes their lives he uses their lives for something greater and that's good news for you and I today that God can take our broken lives and he can repurpose them and and he he begins to equip us we we start following Jesus and he begins to equip us to do what well there's a few things first he he wants us to be Witnesses we are empowered by the Holy Spirit to be Witnesses this means that we should be sharing the life that Jesus has given us with other people and that's for everybody that's just not for the church staff you know like oh Pastor Kurt will take care of that no that's each and every one of us called To Be A Witness we're uh called to overcome sin we need the power of God to overcome sin we need to endure under testing their storms of life are coming and we need to endure we need the power of the Holy Spirit but here's one that's also complicated we need to love others and it's really hard to do that without the power of the spirit in Romans 12 it says don't just pretend to love others so apparently Paul thought there was a lot of pretending don't just pretend to love others really love them hate what is wrong hold tightly to what is good love each other with genuine affection and take Delight in honoring each other friends that is really hard to do without the power of the Holy Spirit how many of you know that that's hard right it's hard to do it's hard to pretend to do that and it's hard to sustain that if you you come into church and you're pretending to do all these things in Jesus name without the power of Jesus you're going to burn out and that's not what Jesus wants he wants us to rely on his power would rely rely on the power of the Holy Spirit I'm going to let you in on a common conversation it's a common conversation that I often have with people you know as we're inviting people to take their next step of Faith to grow uh even you know baptism is one of those times we just invite reach out to people uh you know get baptized you know it's an important step and something that I often hear that I think is well intentioned and sincere but but it kind of shows where where the thinking is at and the time is like people will say something like this well Pastor Dave you know I really want to follow Jesus I actually do want to commit my life to Jesus but I have a lot of unresolved issues so let me go put my life in order let me go take care of of my problems and my situations and once these things are sorted out then I'll come and I'll follow Jesus it goes something like that right so so let me let me go and take care of this and then you'll see me every Sunday I promise Pastor Dave I'll be there you know I'll I'll be committed I'll show up and and all of this you know I'll be in it 100 but here's the problem with that kind of thinking that the devil is very tricky and the devil's a liar and so you need to watch out for his lies because here's the problem number one if you could change on your own you would have done it already okay you would have just done it already if you had the power to do that on your own you would have done it already secondly if you were actually able to fix your life apart from Jesus so you go apart from Jesus and you actually taking care of stuff without Jesus then why would you even come back to Jesus after that at all it doesn't make any sense right uh you know because that that's that's some incredible Supernatural power that you would be tapping into at that point um so that's not the way it works and third the Bible says that it is impossible somebody say impossible to please God apart from Jesus because we are naturally predisposed to sin Romans 8 says for the sinful nature is always somebody say always always hostile to God it never did obey God's laws and it never will that's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God and that's why it's so hard to make the right decisions the right choices to do what you want to do serve God the way you want to serve him is because you're battling with this flesh right you're battling with with your body and what what we want to do and so what we need to do is submit that under the authority of Jesus and the power of God to come upon us so that we can conquer so that we can actually live out the things that God wants us to live out and so I say I say it like this and I encourage you today to come to Jesus as you are you know you can come to Jesus just as you are in fact don't try to change anything about yourself because oftentimes we just make things worse right come to Jesus just as you are and let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think by changing your mind by cleaning you up by letting him give you a purpose for your life let the Holy Spirit do the transformation part you just come to Jesus you keep coming to Jesus and in order to do the work of God we need the power of God because we cannot even follow Jesus without the power of God we need him all the time it is an important and important part of our walk and as the worship team comes up just to recap what we've been talking about Jesus he's going around appearing to his disciples and telling them that they are about to change the world and spread the good news of the kingdom of God and you know I always imagine this like one of those Epic movie moments where the team is you know low on morale they're down and out they go you know into halftime into the locker room and then the coach delivers an inspirational talk an inspirational speech and all of a sudden everybody begins to you know sit up straighter and you know their eyes their gaze is becoming more and more intense and and and finally the coaches like we can do this we can come back let's go let's change the world and then everybody you know there's a frenzy yeah you know there's like a roar there's like a Roar and so everybody goes out and and and then and then they win but Jesus does something interesting he does something similar he's telling them you're gonna go You're Gonna Change the World but then he flips it and he says but here's what you have to do you have to wait don't leave don't leave Jerusalem until you receive the promise that the father gave you of the Holy Spirit and if I were there I would have some questions like come again Jesus you're telling me to change the world but you want me to wait yes okay well how long do I have to wait Jesus I'll wait you know it seems pretty important maybe I can put in my calendar uh until you receive the promise of the Holy Spirit so like maybe around Tuesday the the promise will come like can you give me some more information no just keep waiting and it would continue like that because that's not the point the point is is that Jesus is setting a pattern because he wants them to be waiting expectantly he's setting a pattern that any time that God calls us to do something great we need his power and we can't simply step out on our own that we need the Holy Spirit we need God to go before us we need God to empower us and so we need to live with our priorities and what God is trying to do because God is going to entrust us with some power power to do Miracles power to set the captives free and so if he's going to trust us with his power he needs to know that we know how to yield that we know how to yield to the spirit that we we're following the Holy Spirit would you stand with me today there's a final question that I want to ask it's important to ask and as you're following Jesus and it's this am I living a kingdom-oriented life because Jesus has not only called us to be in his kingdom to get through to endure to survive he's called us to advance as well and for that we need the power of God acts 1 8 says but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem throughout Judea in Samaria into the ends of the Earth now you have to think these were fishermen they had never gone that far from home now he's telling them you're gonna go all over the world imagine for a moment that Jerusalem was Boston Jesus would have said you will be my Witnesses in Boston and in Suffolk County and Essex County and in Revere and Lynn into the ends of the Earth that's a pretty big leap it's a big change in our their thinking their identity who they were now I want to tell you something today you have been called by God you have been called by God you have been anointed for such a time as this you have been appointed to produce lasting fruit and I want to be clear that it is God who has chosen you it is God who has set you apart when he calls us immediately we begin a new life a New Journey with an abundance of forgiveness and healing and hope that's not the end of the road that's just the beginning then God has a mission in the world that he's inviting us to be a part of in Matthew 6 33 he says seek the kingdom of God above all else and live righteously and he will give you everything you need so these are the kingdom questions that we need to be asking because God is Not only calling us out of something our old life our old way of thinking he's calling us to something which is our new life in Christ which involves the mission of God the priorities of God and carrying out the will of God [Music] we need a purpose that burns within us that draws us to Jesus so that we don't keep going back to our old habits so I want to invite you to Bow your head with me and I want to pray pray for you and my prayer is this [Music] that you would be someone with a kingdom-oriented life you would become that person that the Holy Spirit would move in your life that God would break the chains that are holding you back that you would receive the power that you need to advance his kingdom heavenly father today we are here and we know God that we need you we know that there's nothing we can do apart from you Holy Spirit we need you desperately Holy Spirit we need you today Holy Spirit would you draw us to yourself give us understanding open our eyes God open our ears to what you're wanting to do in our lives God we don't want to be Spectators we don't want to be consumers we want to be Kingdom carriers God would you move in this place today in Jesus name at this time we're going to open up the altars but here's what I want you to do if you're serious about being a disciple of Jesus maybe you've gotten off track or maybe you've never really thought about being a follower of Jesus I want to invite you to come to the altar and I want you to as as a symbolic act to respond to what God is doing in your life and say Jesus I want to be a disciple I want to be somebody that changes the world I want to be filled with your Holy Spirit God I want everything that you have for me that's you you can come up to the altar [Music] Surrender Your Life to Jesus today make a decision make a decision to surrender your life to Jesus [Music] some things we just do because Jesus asked us to do them there's still time there's still time for you to come you don't have to do this on your own you don't have to do this by yourself let the Holy Spirit help you let the Holy Spirit Empower you let the Holy Spirit Break the chains off of your life surrender to him say Jesus I Need You you can't pray anything else and Jesus I need you I need you in my life I need you in my family I need you to show up I need you to show up with power in my life and Rescue Me and give me the purpose that I'm supposed to be living for let's continue to respond as we sing this song", "welcome everyone uh once again to East Coast International Church those of you joining us online welcome uh I am excited to be here and see each and every one of you and uh I'm very grateful for this opportunity uh to bring the word of God uh this morning are you guys ready yes all right all right that didn't sound too convincing are you guys ready all right all right awesome awesome all right so we're going to jump in and today I want to talk to you a little bit about strategy can you say strategy stry think of all the ways in which strategy plays a part in our everyday lives in ways that we don't even really can identify most of the time think for example when you go to the grocery store have you ever noticed where they put the milk and the eggs all the time all the way at the end of the grocery store and the reason is they want you walking through the entire store to get there and as you're walking you're like oh yeah I need bread oh yeah I need uh toilet paper oh yeah and you start thinking about all these things and you start spending more money right have you ever noticed how they put the candy right next to the cash register right they know what kid wants you know they know what you want it is a strategic decision to put it there right somebody thought through the process of putting it there think for a moment about a presidential candidates and most political campaigns have at least one or two or sometimes even a team of people who strategize on uh how to touch on a certain Hot Topic issues and how to promote the candidate uh during the election and uh so there's a strategy in place and I want you to notice too uh some of the commercials you know the the Super Bowl is coming up so there's a lot going on and you're starting to see some of the some of the teasers but uh you know recently a while back I started seeing a lot of cute little commercials a lot of little uh Daddy and uh daughter commercials I don't know why it's the strangest thing but I started seeing them over and over and I'm like this is strange um but it's because you know they're selling you this idea in these commercials hey if if you really love your daughter you will buy this brand of diapers or whatever it is that they're selling you right and that's because Google knows you better than you know yourself they know your spending habits they know what you're looking at they know what you're searching up man they've got you pinned and they have a strategy of getting every last scent out of you can I get an amen right all right we we go through that but it's not random it's all by Design there is a design in place and uh if you're paying attention you will notice that even in the spiritual realm or in the spiritual World there is a strategy check out Ephesians 610 where it says a final word be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power put on all God's armor so that you will be able to stand firm against what all strategies of the devil take note of that all strategies meaning the the devil has strategies for we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies so human beings are not our enemies but against evil rulers and authorities of the Unseen World somebody say unseen unseen Unseen World against Mighty powers in the dark world and against evil spirits in the Heavenly places so this is the spiritual world and therefore it shouldn't be a coincidence you should not be surprised that just when you're ready to make progress in an area of your life the enemy will set up a strategy the enemy will send that person your way or that Temptation your way or that sickness to derail you or that conflict to discourage you it is a strategy of the enemy just as you're ready to move forward and take your next step in your spiritual walk chaos will ensue have you noticed that how that happens it's it shouldn't surprise us because it's a strategy and so I want to talk for a moment about the reality of the spiritual world you know often when we think of uh the spiritual world or spirituality we don't immediately think of strategy and in fact our culture at large we we kind of think of it as abstract hard to grasp uh there is a camp of people that are in complete denial they'll say no the spiritual uh world does not exist uh only what we can touch and see and smell uh others uh on the other end of the spectrum you know maybe um you know they they want to believe but they don't really believe because it's so confusing and it's so hard to understand and you know uh most of us have a pretty hard enough time dealing with the physical world we can see right going into the metaphysical world or or what's out there it's just it's too much so why don't we just pretend it doesn't exist right we close our eyes then there's another group of people that have found a way to tap into the spiritual world but they're using it to control other people right so this is known as as witchcraft where we tap into a a spiritual power in order to control other people and so that it may not be called witchcraft but that's the essence and then there's another group of people who kind of live in in in they think of of the spiritual World in terms of like a neutral zone where it's not super friendly but it's also not super dangerous uh you know it's just kind of in between uh recently I was listening to this podcast and this lady who you know sells real estate uh she had a special episode on haunted properties you know ghosts ghost and properties yes and so it was very interesting and she went on to tell her experiences trying to communicate with the ghosts right in one house in particular uh she was walking through the property uh with uh the sellers and uh in this room there was a piano an old piano and you know they were walking and talking and all of the sudden they hear the tingling of the ivory the the the the the piano the piano keys and uh and they're like oh what could that be and so she asked uh them so a few questions come to find out the uh deceased grandmother used to play the piano and so now she's trying to communicate right and so and so she begins to talk about yeah you know I'm I've always been uh an empath and I and I can connect and I can talk to the other side and and and and and you know the the the the ghost of the grandmother is approving of the sale uh and so all this stuff very interesting stuff very interesting I got to tell you I learned a lot uh so when it says that we are in a battle that we're fighting not against flesh and blood we need to pay attention to that because the Bible actually teaches this idea of a Warfare worldview somebody say Warfare worldview It's a tongue TST Warfare worldview right and here's essentially what that means it means that our human existence right our lives are being lived out in the plane of a cosmic war between the forces of darkness and the forces of good right and when it says we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies that that word fighting that's the war that's the war part that's that's where we're struggling that's where uh we are fighting each and every day and uh the idea is that what happens in in the spiritual uh world that we can't see also impacts the physical world that we can see and vice versa right but more on that in just a moment but just hold on to that idea what does Scripture tell us about our role as we Face the spiritual World reality well here's the bottom line our prayers actually matter our prayers actually matter Ephesians 6:18 says pray in the spirit at all times and on every occasion stay alert and be Pur consistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere if we are to engage in prayer then we need to be aware of three components and I these are the three things that I want to share with you today so if you're taking notes the first one is Authority somebody say Authority author all right as in Spiritual Authority uh up next I want to show you a little clip that I ran into that I thought was pretty hilarious and this is what we often believe uh this is what we think of when we think of someone who's super spiritual and and has a lot of authority in prayer so watch this Joel Carpenter is a new Christian so to help him pray we've hired that super Pastor guy you see on TV God please help my marriage we're just really struggling right now oh heavenly father he who has created all things makes the sun and moon rise at his command I beseech you take this woman that you've given to me as a helpmate and bring bring her to her senses that we might abide together forever in a purpose-driven marriage God I'm really frustrated at work help me find a new job I ask you now in this area of employment the who gives me the sustenance in an employer fashion please guide me to something if it Be Your Will that would bring you gloryia my kids are driving me crazy I I don't know what to do you could just help help me out you have blessed me also with many young saplings and I ask at this day that you would help me in my help made to raise them in the way of your word amen God and now I end this time with you Lord bowing before you giving you all that you deserve in sacrifice and in sacrament let it be known that the alpha omega is pleased amen God go real people real prayers all right all right all right so the point of that is that Spiritual Authority has nothing to do with how loud you pray or how fancy you pray for believers for followers of Jesus our Authority quite simply comes from Jesus Jesus gives us our Authority and this means that anyone can pray by the way you can pray you don't have to be a deacon a board member m a TV Pastor a bishop and you certainly don't need to pray like one either you can just be yourself and tell God what you need and so Spiritual Authority or the power to engage in spiritual conflict without getting destroyed comes out of a relationship with God and when we say yes to Jesus Rescue Mission we have that relationship with God Romans 8:15 says so you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful ful slaves instead you receiv received God's spirit when he adopted you as his own children now we call him ABA father so there's this closeness that we have with God and what happens is that sometimes there are people who try to yield spiritual power without Authority and you know as a a a pastor here on staff and uh you know I manage some of the church's uh properties sometimes I am tasked with giving information or taking certain actions on behalf of the church and you know when I do that I I'm not just representing myself in those moments but I am representing the church at large and so you know I may step into a room you know maybe they they think what are you doing here you know uh but in that moment well I'm there on behalf of the church and and kind of stepping in in that under that Authority let's take a look at an instance in the Bible of kind of a a misuse of Spiritual Authority what not to do okay uh the seven sons of SK this is a classic story in the book of Acts 19 this a group of people who are trying to use Jesus's power without a true relationship with Jesus Watch What Happens a group of Jews was traveling from town to town casting out evil spirits they try to use the name of the Lord Jesus in their incantation saying I command you in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches to come out seven sons of ska a leading priests were doing this but one time when they tried it the evil spirit replied I know Jesus and I know Paul but who are you then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them overpowered them and attacked them with such violence that they fled from the house naked and battered so what we learn from this story is that in order to make use of Jesus Authority we need to actually be walking under Jesus Authority because if we don't then it could be really really dangerous you see these people they knew of Jesus but they didn't actually know Jesus and and that was revealed in that moment they were trying to manipulate Jesus to get what they wanted and so that's that's a misuse of authority um but in the Bible we also find proper uses of authority uh go back to the Old Testament for a moment there's a story about Elijah Elijah great man of God and he has this uh young um assistant a servant uh and there comes the moment where they find themselves surrounded by a large army that is about to invade and they have nowhere to go have you ever felt overwhelmed in your life where uh you felt overwhelmed outnumbered surrounded by all these difficulties from all sides well that's where they were and they had nowhere to go and they were outnumbered and they were outgunned and they were outplanned or so the Army thought and so this uh young assistant he starts freaking out we're surrounded what are we gonna do where are we gonna go and Elijah keeps his cool and watch what he does in in 2 Kings 6 it says then Elijah prayed that's really what we should do in these moments then Elijah prayed oh Lord open his eyes and let him see right so this is a spiritual sight that he's talking about the Lord opened the young man's eyes and when he looked up he saw that the hillside around Elijah was filled with horse and Chariots of Fire all right so Heaven's big guns are coming out and you know as the aramean Army Advanced towards him Elijah prayed oh Lord please make them blind so the Lord struck them with blindness as Elijah had asked so get this in the natural they are surrounded there's no way they can win but in the spiritual world it is the aramean army that is actually outnumbered because God is with him and this is true of all of us that sometimes we may feel surrounded but God is actually on our side God is fighting for us and so how was Elisha able to stand his ground in the face of overwhelming attack well the key is found in the verses uh leading up to this moment we when we when you get home I I encourage you to read the story it's hilarious but uh basically we find out that Elijah was a man who was constantly yielding to the voice of God and God was giving him strategy to outsmart the enemy and so you know the enemy was coming this way and and and God was telling him go this way and so he he was one uping the enemy and that's what happens when we pray by the way and so he he was a man under Authority and in relationship with God he was constantly communicating with God and I want to ask you today are you walking under the authority of Jesus in your life are you walking in the authority of Jesus in your life life have you made a decision to accept God's forgiveness and leadership in your life and in every area of your life because when we are under the authority of Jesus we can then live a life of prayer and we can stand confidently in the face of opposition we can stand our ground we can be bold when we stand under the authority of Jesus so Authority number two we need alignment somebody say alignment alignment I want to talk about one of the worst experiences a person could be subjected to Boston traffic right have you ever had to go into Boston for a hospital visit or something important right and and what do you what do you find you'll find all kinds of obstacles in your way right from uh someone uh hitting their brakes right in front of you right no blinkers you know maybe there's a detour or a tunnels shut down people with unusual uh road rage none of you in this room of course maybe in accident or a flat tire clogging up a flow of traffic there is so much out of control right so so many things out of your control when you're driving but you still have to do your part you can't just pull over on the side of the road and and and sit there you have to get to where you're going you have to drive your car through that Maze and so prayer is lot like that prayer is very uh complex because there are many factors at play there are many uh things that cross purposes of each other and so uh let me give you some examples number one as we're praying as you're praying uh we have God's will somebody say God's will God's will God's will is what God wants to see happening in our lives good things blessings all these things but then we also have human will right we have what every individual human chooses to do you see the Bible teaches that God's will can actually be opposed so just because God wants something to happen doesn't mean that it will happen in the Gospel of Luke 7:30 it says this but the Pharisees and experts in religious law rejected somebody say rejected God's plan for them for they had refused John's baptism so get this God has a good plan for them a good plan for their lives and their response is no thank you we're all set and so God's will is opposed and you might ask yourself how can this be how can it be that that that God's will can be opposed in my life well you see friends the Bible teaches that God is love and real love in order for it to be genuine love it has to be freely chosen you have to choose it willingly and freely it can't be coerced God cannot make you do anything God cannot make you obey God cannot make you respond to him he can help you but he's not going to make you do it there is an element of Free Will free choice that we have to participate in the process I want to ask you a question and as you look at your life as you look at this world as messed up as it is how often do you think that God is actually getting his way on the earth in your life how often do you think God is actually getting his way because the Bible teaches and reality teaches us that God doesn't always get his way turn on the TV for two seconds and you will see War famine violence sickness death right suffering children that is not the will of God that is not the will of God and yet it happens because people often can or always can and often do uh reject the will of God God wants peace God wants love uh but human beings we we have a free will and if that wasn't confusing enough there's another element in the mix which is Rebel Spirits somebody say rebel Spirits Rebel Spirits these are Fallen Angels you got your your demons your evil spirits your unclean spirits they're all these demons that are at War they are fighting against constantly against the will of God and you might be like where is that in the Bible well one uh classic uh passage is uh in in Daniel The Book of Daniel the Prophet Daniel he's been praying for 21 days you know he's the original Daniel Fast you know praying guy that's the guy uh so he's he's doing the 21 days of uh prayer and fasting um but he's not hearing anything from God have you ever been there you're you're you're just praying and nothing's happening you're not hearing anything and on the 21st day an angel shows up with the answer to Daniel's prayer and he tells Daniel why he took so long and watch what happens in Daniel 10 the angel told him don't be afraid Daniel since the first day you began to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God your request has been heard in heaven I have come in answer to your prayer but watch this but for 21 days the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia so this is an evil uh demon a ruler authority over a geographical location he blocked his way and then Michael one of the archangels came to help me and I left him there uh with the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia so this is like crazy right all these all these things are happening and all Daniel knows is I'm not hearing anything from God a great encouragement by the way the story of just keep on praying just keep on praying just keep on praying but what's Happening Here what we're seeing is these free willed fallen angels that can directly and strategically oppose the will of God that's why life is hard that's why you have all these struggles each and every day uh we wrestle with different things and that is why and so we come to the point now where we have to ask ourselves so what are we going to do about it all right if this is the reality of the spiritual world what are we going to do well here's what we're going to do we are going to do our job all right we do our job tell your neighbor do your job no but say like you mean it do your job okay in honor of uh the great late bill bich you know may rest in peace I know he's not dead but he's no longer with us he's moved on uh to uh greener pastures but we do our part we do our job because our prayers actually matter your prayers the prayers that you've been praying they actually matter you see somehow in a way we don't fully understand God partners with us through our prayers and our prayer helps more of God's will to be done on the earth than if we didn't pray I'm going to say that one more time somehow in a way we don't fully understand God partners with us through prayer and our prayer helps more of God's will to be done on the earth than if we chose not to pray so we need to pray if if you're having doubts just pray and here's what happens when we do pray when we come to God and we say God uh this is what we need Phil Philippians 4:6 it says don't worry about anything instead pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done then you will experience God's peace which exceeds anything we can understand his peace will guard your hearts and Minds as you live in Christ Jesus so notice this there is a sense that when we get alone with God and we bring our burdens before him and you know we we spend some time praying and asking that we leave our worries and anxieties at the feet of Jesus we don't bring them with us we lay them down and we experience this peace that surpasses all understanding that's what happens when we pray and so even even if the problem is still there after prayer we we have the peace of God that God I know you're working that God I know you're with me God I know that you are fighting my battles and we say it in faith because that is actually what's happened so we bring we entrust god with our needs and so what happens once we pray okay so I've prayed now uh and usually what we expect is to see God doing Miracles right there's there's this response to prayer that you know I call it watch this you know like like when God says watch this and he goes to work and there's a miracle have you ever seen God work in your life in a way that you can't explain it and it's just like whoa like God you're really uh showing off in my life and that's usually the kind of response that we expect from God when we pray and by the way we should When you pray you should pray with boldness you should pray with faith you should pray as if you're actually expecting God to do something in your life and so so that's one answer to prayer but on the other hand we must also mature in our understanding of what prayer is because friends let me tell you in case you didn't know prayer is not a formula as the seven sons of ska found out prayer is not a formula and the end end goal of prayer is not to get what we want the end goal of prayer is to know God and have the character of Jesus developed in us through a life of obedience as we learn to obey God we're having the character of Jesus developed in us and so uh you know currently with my my daughter an AEL we're we're currently um in the toddler stage where we're teaching her boundaries we're teaching her that there's appropriate times for certain things right like when when my daughter wants a banana guess when she wants it right now I want that right now uh uh you know a lollipop which she calls a pop pop you know she wants it right now right she she doesn't understand yet the concept of waiting and so uh she wants it right away or sometimes when I get home I'm I'm tired after work and she jumps into my arms only to point to the sweets at the top shelf and and she's like you know what I want and uh you know it's all very cute it's adorable but my hope is this my hope would be that at some point in our relationship we would be able to go beyond the phase where we're just telling each other what to do and that we are maturing in that relationship you know sometimes I just want to be able to just have some moments where we can enjoy each other's presence uh I I want us to play together uh I want us to explore and discover things together uh I want us to work on projects together you you get where I'm going right so so that's why when we pray often times we will get a different response immediately uh than what we're immediately hoping right we'll get a different response we want something and we'll get a different response and here's some examples of some responses that God might give you when you pray number one no sometimes you will pray for something that is outside the will of God and the answer is no and it's going to continue to be no and it's not going to change right no that is not in line with my will and so God will say no the second thing is uh sometimes God will say slow right you need to slow down you need to check yourself uh before you wreck yourself and uh you need to not yet you're not ready we need to slow down uh no slow and sometimes God will say grow like this is an area where you really need to grow you really need to mature in this area so God will uh have you waiting uh for you to grow and sometimes he will say go which which is yes you are praying exactly what's in line with my will go for it right and so uh know Slow Grow and go these are all uh answers that we can hear when we pray from God but our number one goal in prayer should be to develop a vibrant relationship with God Amen because as we get to know God we have a better understanding of what he wants done on the earth and we can pray more and more effectively and this is why it's so important for us to know know what the will of God is this is why we're always challenging you to do the monthly goals to to follow along with the scriptures to come to Bible study because we need to know what the will of God is so that then we can pray in accordance to that because we can't just say God this is what I want and then Force God to bless it without first checking if that's actually within the will of God and so we we have to make sure and when we pray the goal is to align ourselves with what God wants to see happening and for us to ask him to do it remember it doesn't matter how good what God wants is he's not going to force it on us we have to ask him we have to invite we have to pray and there's a crucial moment in scripture in the life of Jesus where he's in the garden of the Gethsemane this is right before he's arrested and you know he goes uh to the crucifixion and he prays this prayer and watch this this is one of the most powerful prayers that a person can pray in Luke 22 he said father father if you are willing please take this cup of suffering away from me yet I want your will to be done not mine amen notice I want your will to be done not mine as the worship team comes up he's obviously Jesus is obviously referring to the horrific death that was he was about to experience and he's he's asking God God is there any way that I don't have have to go through this and what makes this prayer so powerful is that Jesus is surrendering his will to the father's will he's surrendering his will he and he's not saying careful with this he's not saying God your will be done whatever that will is no he knew exactly what the will of God was in that moment and it was the cross right and many times the challenge in in in US surrendering our will in prayer is that we we know exactly what God is calling us to do many times but it is hard many times it is painful and for Jesus he knew he knew what the will of God was in that moment he knew it it was to go to the cross and die for our sins and this leads me to the final concept I want to talk about regarding prayer and it is one that is often overlooked which is action Authority align and action this is the part where we don't just pray with our mouths but we pray with our feet we pray through our actions this is the part where we don't delay and we don't keep putting it off and we don't just talk about it but we actually do what Jesus is asking us to do what he's inviting us to do because shortly after that prayer that Jesus prayed Jesus was arrested and he found himself like Elisha surrounded and outnumbered and in that moment Jesus has this strange opportunity to pull back to get out of the will of God he has an opportunity because you see Peter the hoad disciple of Jesus he took out his sword and he tried to defend Jesus cuts off one of the officers ears and he tries to stop Jesus from going to the cross on now but watch what Jesus tells him in John 18 Jesus said to Peter put your sword back in its sheath shall I not drink from the cup of suffering the father has given me and then in a crazy turn of events he then goes and he heals that guy's ear and then he gets arrested and then he gets pulled away to the Cross even though in the natural it seemed like Jesus was losing he was actually winning amen he was actually winning and in in the ensuing hours he would lay down his life he would suffer and die the death of a criminal even though he was innocent and for three days he would lay in a tomb but on the third day he rose from the dead and this was the result of his obedience in prayer Colossians 2:14 he canell the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross in this way he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities all of those rulers and authorities we read about before he has disarmed them he shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross and this is why friends to live in Christ is to live in Victory we get to live in the victory of Jesus because Jesus has already won he already won on the cross and now Jes Jesus calls us to be his ambassadors to the rest of the world where God's rulership is not yet recognized but we get to be a part of that and when we pray we we are praying we are we are partnering with God and extending that rulership to other people in other homes and other families in other communities that's what we're doing when we pray we're inviting literally inviting Heaven to Earth into every situation so today would you please stand with [Music] me you take a moment and and just bow your head with me if you're here in this room and you are a follower of Jesus if you have surrendered your life to Jesus if you have accepted Jesus forgiveness and Leadership over your life if you are a child of of God and you have access to the authority of Jesus then today I want to invite you to align your desires with God's desires and take the actions that he is leading you to do but if you're here today and you're not sure if you are a child of God if you're not sure that you are living under the authority of Jesus today would be a good day to begin and to surrend Surrender Your Life to Jesus if you're like I just don't know where to begin what action to do I'm inviting you today to begin taking up your spiritual arms you see sometimes we have to take up our spiritual arms Jesus said I have come to destroy the works of the enemy and as followers of Jesus we get to be a part of that so I want to challenge you today to take up up the spiritual arms that God has given you to take up the weapon of prayer to pray for your family to pray for everyone around you pray like you've never prayed before there is a battle for your life in the lives of everyone around you and your prayers actually matter so what we're going to do right now is we're going to sing this song and as we do we're going to open up the altars if you need to come and pray we're going to invite you to do that at this time come and pray come Surrender Your Life to Jesus respond to God because your prayers matter your prayers matter today let's sing this song together", "[Music] [Music] welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting today we're going to be talking about how we can pray for those in our workplaces in matthew chapter 5 verse 9 jesus said god blesses those who work for peace for they will be called the children of god now i don't know what you think about when you think of peace i often think about the absence of conflict of worries everyone getting along and just being harmonious together well unfortunately that's not always realistic and that's not the piece actually that jesus is talking about in john chapter 16 verse 33 jesus says i have told you all of this so that you would have peace in me you will have trials and sorrows but take heart for i have overcome the world so what does it look like for us to work for peace peace in this instance means reconciliation to god so how do we pray for reconciliation to god for our co-workers that's what we'll be doing here today we will be thinking about our co-workers and praying for them to be reconciliated to god so that they can have a rich relationship with the one who created them so let's work for peace through prayer in our workplaces right now god we thank you so much for the opportunity that we have to come before you and lift up our co-workers lift up our bosses lift up the people that work around us the people in our corporate offices god the people that may clean up after us and take out the trash whoever has any sort of place in our workplace god we lift them up to you right now god we know that you created each and every person that we see and that we work with god and we recognize that this peace that these people need to have and the peace that we're looking for in our workplaces isn't just an absence of conflict or having no trials and troubles god we recognize that each person in our workplace needs to be reconciled to you god and so we pray for these people that we work with god we pray that you would draw them to you we pray that you would show them your love for them show them that you are for them and not against them god and give us opportunities this week to show the love of jesus to them so that we can be a witness of what jesus did on the cross for us and for everyone that we work with as well we pray this in jesus name [Music] amen [Music] thank you so much for joining us here today we hope that you will continue to pray throughout the day and that you'll join us tomorrow as we continue our week of prayer and fasting", "good morning everybody all right somebody say thank you to Jesus today come on thank you thank you Jesus the uh today we are gonna uh it's gonna be a a lot of scripture reading uh today through a couple of things uh passages that you'll be able to follow along with and and stay connected but next Sunday uh is what we're calling connection Sunday this is a an all hands on deck kind of Sunday meaning that Revere online and Lynn will all be here at the Lynn location so Revere is going to be heading over here online uh you got to get on a plane to get here that's fine uh be here at 11. uh uh we'll we'll uh wherever you're at everybody show up in person for this connection uh Sunday that we're doing at the post office one day there was a letter that came addressed in shaky handwriting the letter was addressed to God with no address the postal worker that saw it thought he should open it to see what it was about the letter read Dear God I am an 83 year old Widow living on a very small pension yesterday someone stole my purse they had a hundred dollars in it which is all the money I had until my next pension check next Sunday is Christmas and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner without that money I have nothing to buy food with I have no family to turn to and you are my only hope can you please help me sincerely Edna the postal worker was touched he showed the letter to all the other workers everybody dug in and found a few dollars and and threw it in an envelope they collected 96 dollars which they put in an envelope and sent to the woman the rest of the day all the workers were excited about what they had done for Edna and the dinner that she would be able to share at Christmas with her friends Christmas came and went and a few days later after Christmas came another letter from the same old lady to God all the workers gathered around ready to and eager to read the letter it read dear God how can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me because your gift of love I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends we had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift by the way you were four dollars short I think it might have been the thieves at the post office no good deed goes unpunished they say trying to do the right thing and being called a thief we're going to talk about this a little today it's dangerous to be a servant you try to do the right thing you can be misunderstood you can even be slandered but I don't want you to miss this today there's a lot of talk in the world about power and Leadership but the greatest goal for the life of a person in the kingdom of God the greatest and highest goal is that of servanthood to be the greatest servant to be the greatest we must be the servant of all and being a servant can be a little bit treacherous you do something great nobody notices but if you mess up it's all over the place like the media team makes one mistake in six years everybody notices right it's complicated to be a servant here's why because servants are simply broken humans serving other broken humans and so it can be complicated it could be tricky as a result it's very easy for the enemy of our life and of our soul to set traps that could lead us to destruction one of the traps is to not be a servant to not be a servant is a trap that leads to destruction but to serve also comes with a Minefield of traps and schemes or strategies of Satan Ephesians chapter 6 says it like this put on all God's armor so you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil somebody say strategies so the enemy has strategies for your life strategies of Satan to sink you to train wreck you these are not good strategies He's the bad guy some of these strategies are obvious and some of them are more subtle First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 says if you think you are standing strong be careful not to fall sometimes strategies are happening schemes are happening traps are happening and sometimes we can not see them for what they clearly are and we can fall into it so we're going to learn about this today we're going to be highlighting a gentleman in the Bible named gehazi today we're going to hear a tale really A Tale of warning from a servant the times let me set it up the times were hard for the people of Israel the nation of Israel was rapidly deteriorating is one Wicked ruler followed another Wicked ruler that led the people further and further astray from God Elijah somebody say Elijah Elijah had been an important Prophet calling Israel back to faithfulness at the end of Elijah's life he was swept up into heaven in a whirlwind in a fiery Chariot Chariot cool cool way to go cool way to go Elisha had been his servant Elisha somebody say Elisha so a different person had been Elijah's servant when Elijah Elijah had been swept away and God's power then rested on Elisha with a double portion so so twice the author twice the power is like a really big deal and so we pick up the story of Elisha and his servant named gehazi in second Kings chapter four verse eight one day Elisha went to the town of shoonam a wealthy woman lived there and she urged him to come to her home for a meal after that whenever he passed that way he would stop there for something to eat she said to her husband I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God let's build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed a table a chair and a lamp then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by one day Elisha returned to shunam and he went up to this Upper Room to rest he said to his servant gahazi Sega hazi so there here he is in the story now watch him for the rest of the day tell the woman from shunum I want to speak to her when she appeared Elisha said to gehazi tell her we appreciate the kind concern you have shown us what can we do for you can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army no she replied my family takes good care of me later Elijah askahazi what can we do for her gehazi replied she doesn't have a son and her husband is an old man call her back again Elisha told him when the woman returned Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway next year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms no my Lord she cried o man of God don't deceive me and get my hopes up like that but sure enough the woman soon became pregnant and at that time the following year she had a son just as Elisha had said now it's a fascinating story on a lot of levels I'm always intrigued in the story about how do you build a room on your roof or a table of lamp and a chair you know all those things are fascinating to me but today I want you to focus on gehazi the servant notice that Ghazi is all over this story and the miracle in the story though is this that a woman who desperately wanted a son a year later was given a son in the common reading of the story we give thanks to God for this miracle which it was and that we should and he performed it through his servant Elisha which is a hundred percent true but it was gehazi's idea a hundred percent his idea gehazi is the one that went to get the woman gahazi was the one that did much of the speaking for Elijah and gehazi is the one that came up with the idea in the first place and Elisha gets all the credit if you're a good servant that doesn't bother you if you're wrestling with some things you might feel overlooked that feeling of being overlooked here's just a hint everybody feelings are informers not facts just cause you feel it you know you have to pay attention to it but it doesn't mean it's a fact so just because you feel overlooked does not in fact mean you were overlooked but you can see how it's possible that he could have felt overlooked and we're inserting that into the story and the reason we're doing it is because of what happens in the rest of the story you'll see that gehazi makes some mistakes later on and how did he get there so yeah I'm going back to this part here in Second Kings 4 18 we continue the story one day when her child was older so this is the miracle child he went out to help his father who was working with the Harvester suddenly he cried out my head hurts my head hurts his father said to one of the servants carry him home to his mother so the servant took him home and his mother held him on her lap but around noon time he died she carried him up this is the miracle child that died she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God then shut the door and left him there she sent a message to her husband send one of the servants and a donkey so I can hurry to the man of God and come right back why go today he asked it's neither a new Moon Festival or a Sabbath but she said it will be all right so she saddled the donkey and said to the servant hurry don't slow down unless I tell you to as she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel Elisha saw her in the distance he said to gehazi look the woman from is coming run out to meet her and ask her is everything all right with you your husband and your child yes the woman told gehazi everything is fine here we see that the miracle child has died for some reason working in the fields with his father something tragic has happened and he dies into mother's arms she decides quickly to put him in the prophet's bed not everybody has a prop bed for the prophet in their house right but she had built one so in the prophet's bed and she decides quickly immediately go find the miracle working Prophet Elisha and on our way she runs into gehazi and essentially dismisses him and it can seem like she he's being dismissed but in reality she's exercising her faith and needs quickly to get to the prophet to get this situation fixed she rushes to Elisha verse 27 when she came to the man of God at the mountain she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet gehazi began to push her away so the servant's pushing the poor woman away but the man of God said leave her alone she's deeply troubled but the Lord has not told me what it is then she said did I ask you for a son my Lord and didn't I say don't deceive me and get my hopes up in the middle of all this has he's pushing her away this is years later after this Mo this child was born years later somehow in this meantime he's gotten all caught up in the propriety of who Elisha is he misses the obvious distress that this woman is in he misses the true mission of why they're even there to begin with verse 29 then Elijah said to kahazi get ready to travel take my staff and go don't talk to anyone along the way go quickly lay the staff on the child's face but the boy's mother said as surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live I won't go home unless you go with me so Elisha returned with her now Elisha has sent gehazi on he's running 100 miles as fast as he can run to perform this miracle on Elisha's behalf he's like I got the staff I got the staff I'm gonna it's gonna be awesome it's hard beating fast adrenaline running through his veins you can imagine that he would be anticipating in the excitement of this miraculous response as he obeyed the prophet surely he would be involved in a miracle of raising someone from the dead but after all because after all this boy even being born was his idea verse 31 gehazi hurried on ahead laid the staff in the child's Faith face but nothing happened there was no sign of life he returned to meet Elisha and told him the child is still dead when Elisha arrived the child was indeed dead lying there on the prophet's bed he went in alone shut the door behind him and prayed to the Lord then he laid down on the child's body placing his mouth on the child's mouth his eyes on the child's eyes and his hands on the child's hands and as he stretched out on him the child's body began to grow warm again Elisha got up walked back and forth across the room the once and then stretched himself out again on the child this time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes then Elisha summoned gehazi called the child's mother he said and when she came in Elijah said here take your son she fell at his feet bowed before him overwhelmed with gratitude then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs now everything works out fine in the end it's kind of a traumatic set of situations and circumstances but he ends up coming back to life it all works out fine even though gehazi wasn't able to get things done as he thought would happen or as I'm conjecturing that he thought the boy is raised from the dead the mother is happy Elisha gets the honor after raising the boy from the dead Elisha and gahazi go to another region where there was a famine and a group of prophets come to meet Elisha and gehazi gehazi is entrusted with making soup or a stew for everybody so they can all eat which accidentally gets poisoned with a pocket full of wild gourds this happens frequently I know but like it truly is accidentally it wasn't accidentally it was actually accidentally laughs but it's okay because Elisha's there and Elisha performs a miracle and the stew is fine a little bit later Elisha tells gahazi that he needs to feed a hundred people but they only have a little bit of bread and a little bit of grain that's all they have there's nowhere near enough food to feed everybody and he doubts Elisha and says it can't be done and then this miracle is performed and once again Elisha performs a miracle in spite of gehazi's doubt and it says in verse 44 and when they gave it to the people there was plenty for all and some left over just as the Lord had promised now you may think well that's interesting is there a story of a man who tells his servants to feed a lot of people with just a little bit of food does that sound familiar but it does sound familiar because of Jesus Jesus had his disciples his servants feed over 5 000 people with just a little bit of fish and a little bit of bread and there were leftovers for days now when you know the story of Jesus first and then read earlier in the Old Testament you will frequently see that Jesus in his teaching and actions was connecting himself to the ancients so that people could see hey hey the same God then same God now just happens to be up close and personal Elijah was great Elisha was greater Jesus the greatest right so gehazi the faithful servant of Elisha the young man that is clearly being groomed to be the next great prophet Elijah Elisha Jesus it should have been Elijah Elisha yahazi Jesus he's been given access and opportunity he is entrusted with the most important of tasks and assignments he is literally entrusted with the care and safety of the man of God he has the greatest assignment on the earth at that moment take care of this man Elisha to be prepared now we're looking at gehazi through the lens of knowing I'm looking at it knowing the rest of the story we jump ahead in the story and there's a man named Naaman who was a high-ranking soldier of influence and wealth Naaman had leprosy which is a horrible disease of the day and he went to the prophet Elisha to see if he could be healed verse 9 so Naaman went with his horses and chariots and waited at the door of Elijah's house but Elisha sent a messenger well who is Elisha always sending all the time Ghazi that's probably gehazi out to him with his message go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River then your skin will be restored and you will be healed of your leprosy but Naaman became angry and walked away I thought he would certainly come out to meet me he said I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy call on the name of the Lord as God and heal me it was a little frustrated okay it was frustrating just getting healed on the spot he had to go do some work to get his healing his servants convinced him to go ahead take the extra time travel to the Jordan River he goes he does exactly what he's told to do and he is healed Naaman was so thankful that he returned and offered a sizable gift of gratitude but Elisha the man of God refuses to receive any gift then Naaman offered to at least give a gift to Elisha's servant gehazi but Elisha declines on gehazi's behalf and set an amen away in peace now if you're wrestling with all this other stuff if you're having like internal doubts and you feel like you've been dismissed or overlooked and and just kind of Forgotten and not getting due credit and not not getting the headline moments if you're forgetting the value of servanthood and the master says no he doesn't need anything he's good because he gets it in his head that Elisha is wrong for not taking this opportunity for personal gain or personal wealth verse 21 so gehazi set off after name it when Naaman sagahazi running after him he climbed down from his Chariot and went to meet him is everything all right Naaman asked yes gehazi said but my master has sent me to tell you that two young prophets from the Hill Country of Ephraim have just arrived he would like 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothing to give them by all means take twice as much silver Naaman insisted he gave him two sets of clothing tied up the money in two bags sent two of his servants to carry the gifts for gehazi but when they arrived at the Citadel gahazi took the gifts from the servants and sent the men back then he went and hid the gifts inside the house when he went into his master Elisha asked him where have you been gehazi I haven't been anywhere he said there's a lot more of that story but and you can read it in second Kings chapter five but greed takes over the servant and greed is what ultimately brings him to ruin the servant is confronted by his master it lies he's made up the story he's hidden the well he's trying to do all this other stuff and he completely messes it up he ends up getting cursed with the leprosy that Naaman had for fraudulently taking the silver and clothes and lying and misrepresenting God and Elisha don't misrepresent them don't misrepresent God how do you do that by living the wrong way by saying they're like that's a really important Point verse 27 because you have done this you and your descendants will suffer from naaman's leprosy forever when gahazi left the room he was covered with Leprosy his skin was white as snow read that story and you're not paying attention to gehazi this sounds like an unfortunate moment but when you're paying attention to gehazi you're like I'm the gehazi in the story I gotta pay attention to him how does that happen he's been serving and helping and part of the story of the most miraculous person in history up to that point he's the number two to this guy but at any other point in history would be like being the number one guy being number two at this point in history is a big deal and he misses it he misses it and I want us to pay attention to this Jesus had Judas Elisha had gehazi the enemy is always setting traps for the Servants of God shows up in different ways shows up in different ways for each of us different things trip different people up gehazi was no longer content just blessing other people he managed to take this servanthood's status again in the kingdom of God servanthood is the highest value it's not like the love it's the highest value not leadership isn't the highest value servanthood is the highest value power is not the highest value servanthood is the highest value if you find yourself pursuing power check yourself pursue servanthood he abuses his seat of influence and privilege he makes up a story he tells lies he makes a plan of Deceit to try to hide his misconduct his thoughts shifted to how to use the blessing to become blessed for selfish gains instead of recognizing how blessed he was in order to be a blessing he got it all backwards we can see clearly that he became greedy somehow he became entitled perhaps through discouragement or disillusionment or being dismissed or having doubts whatever it was in gehazi's Journey he became self-focused instead of others focused what's best for me instead of what's best for us or what's best for all instead of how can I be a blessing it became how can I become blessed see how subtle that is Lord I want everybody to be blessed especially me it's subtle he shifted from how could he be the best servant to how can I become the most successful God doesn't call us to be the most successful he calls us to be the greatest servant does the worship team comes up prosperity can be a trap or it can be a testimony It's Tricky Prosperity is not an opportunity to off-ramp away from servanthood a lot of people become prosperous and they're like I don't have time to serve anymore I got too much stuff I have too many things to do there's not enough hours in the day rather Prosperity is given by God to propel us to Greater service not decreased service gehazi's perspective has become corrupted and it led to an ultimately disappointing outcome think about gehazi he helped to bring a barren woman a son help bring the dead to life help to feed the hungry help bring the love provision and miracles of god to people in desperate need he could have been rather he should have been the next after Elisha instead he sold his spiritual inheritance for Earthly silver so I want to I'm going to challenge this all today guard against these traps Satan's strategies for servants guard yourself against these things you see he faced the Peril of feeling used and unappreciated he faced the Peril of feeling dismissed and disrespected faced the Peril of hidden greed it's important that we call out these strategies so that we don't fall into those traps servants we're servants servants must always stay focused on the master our Master is Jesus [Music] whatever Jesus wants we are servants to Jesus and whenever our Master succeeds we succeed when Jesus succeeds we succeed we do our part as the servant and God does his part as the master and through our service we get to see God bring about his purposes in our life and in the lives of other people foreign with me as we close today [Music] there's some strategies of Satan out there to to train wreck you for you to fall into his traps when you are aware of what they are it's easier to avoid them when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't even realize you're in it and once you call it out you can ask Jesus to help get you out [Music] when we are in the that deep quicksand that Satan traps Us in Jesus can pull us out put us on a solid rock today the kind of response to this is like a self-evaluation where am I at am I servanthood my highest priority is servanthood my highest goal my highest value if I've been chasing and pursuing other things [Music] and how could I bring that into alignment these are the kinds of questions we ask ourselves on a day like today so we're going to spend some time as the worst team leads us in prayer and and response and reflection the altars are open let's just spend some time talking this out with Jesus today foreign", "\n\n**7.16.19**\n\n**General Notes - Pastor Joshua**\n\n**Absent - Carolyn, Joshua, Tanisha, Danielle  **\n\n  *

it is wonderful to be able to share God's word with you today and I want to ask your permission to be soft for a second here um you know I've been here for the last 12 years of my life isn't that crazy 12 years of my life I know some of you guys will think I'm 20 but uh I'm not um but the longer I'm here the more I fall in love with East Coast International Church it is a gift to be able to see what God is doing in Lynn and Revere and it really is such a gift to be here we have an incredible church with a gifted committed and real team of pastors and staff I am lucky to call myself one of them and to be able to see them use God see God use them throughout this week the weeks and I just want you to know how blessed you are to have the leaders that God has given you here in addition to our vocational staff it is each of our dedicated and faithful volunteers who carry out the mission of God here that make us such a great church we are so lucky for each of you who call East Coast International Church your home I'm I am lucky I am blessed to be here and I'm done being soft it now if there's one thing that I've learned over the last few years that people hate being wrong am I right is that not something we have seen tremendously and who here loves to be right like yes all the time if your hand's not up you're lying it is so satisfying there really is nothing like it like for example when your kid or maybe your sibling challenges you on something like you know Uno The Great Divide between friends and family members can you stack draw two and draw fours I know some people had to break up because they couldn't handle it because sometimes it's just hard to be wrong or you know there's some obscure fact that they challenge you on and like when your sibling especially when they try to tell you that you're wrong um right now the good thing is you can look it up or if we're honest you ask Siri or Alexa or whoever to find out who in fact is right and there's nothing like when Alexa says she's right right on the other hand there's nothing quite like the reaction that you're gonna get from someone or you will see in someone who gets corrected by another person this is the kind of thing that surpasses Generations from the youngest of us to the oldest of us we hate being called out for being wrong right now um I know that for myself I've adjusted my language quite a bit I actually just did between Services because I have started to realize that I really don't know as much as I think I know a lot of times there are these obscure facts and I'm like why do I where do I know that from I'm like telling people oh yeah this this and this I'm like is that true is that from a tick tock like I don't know where I'm getting this information and so I've adjusted my language quite a bit to say like I don't know I guess all I know is that there's a lot that I really don't know right now one of my favorite memories of a time I learned to be wrong was back in the day when I was a kids Pastor in all city kids you know uh let me tell you I'm going to tell you the story but before I do you might doubt my education after you find this out about me so please number one don't judge me um and number two remember I'm a pastor for a reason I'm not an engineer I got a 17 on my final science exam to graduate high school but I did it I made it out so um what I need from you is to make me feel good pretend for a second that what I'm going to be wrong on isn't a super widely known fact can you do that for me I'll take you back to this time imagine me fresh out of college bachelor's degree in Hand high GPA so intelligent right and I'm here waxing eloquently to the kids making beautiful brilliant engaging yeah it's easily understood uh spiritual analogies such as this one stars are rocks that reflect the Sun and help them understand the wonders of wait wait stars are rocks that reflect the Sun and in the same way we should reflect Jesus and show the world God's love some of you guys already caught it you already figured out where I was wrong some of you guys good thank you if you don't know what's wrong makes me feel better so I'm going in I'm like yes this poor uneducated children I'm gonna help them understand the wonders of the universe in addition to the greatness of God's love they're so welcome imagine my surprise when in the middle of my grand analogy a Wee child speaks up and says Pastor Tanisha Stars aren't rocks they're gas how many of you knew that who knew that put your hands down you're supposed to pretend you didn't know you didn't know I'm impressed however in the moment I rather condescendingly so laugh to myself poor boy I thought what a travesty this public school system must be in worse shape than I've heard so as I started to correct him more of the children by my surprise started to say the same thing I like the proud grown-up I was Double Down absolutely not stars are not gas so it's a 21st century we look it up and I'm like I'm about to show these kids I'm about to school them like they're going to go to school and be like wow teacher like my pastor she's so smart so I'm looking it up I'm like hold up stars are yes turns out I was wrong now this is where you make me feel better you're supposed to gasp stars are gas what crazy I know I know now there's nothing like having a today years old moment in front of like 20 kids there's nothing nothing like it and that was the day that Ethan Chevalier taught me something that after 16 years of education somehow I hadn't learned I was wrong say that for me today I was wrong even saying those words doesn't it just like hurt a little bit I know you're like well Pastor Trisha you thought Stars weren't rocks doesn't hurt that bad like come on but even saying I was wrong it does it's like a hit to the ego right but being wrong isn't always terrible it might not be feel great in the moment but we benefit as people when we're wrong actually let me correct that we benefit as people when we admit we are wrong it is only after admitting we're wrong that we're able to learn what's right now certainly there are a lot of gray things in this world life with all of its complexity is bound and nuance and that I know to be true however for as much gray as there is there's also just as much black and white there is truth in this world concrete objective quantifiable truth and that's how we know that sometimes we are wrong one of the best things we can learn is to be comfortable with being wrong about the right things in my life I've learned this lesson the hard way many times in my life I used to say I would never date someone with kids that's going to be terrible I'm so glad that I was willing to be wrong about that growing up I thought that doing things my way and trying to be a good person to fix all my problems without anyone's help was my only option in life I'm so glad that I was wrong about that I thought I was destined to live out a generational cycle of poverty and uncontrollable mental health in that God was unable to change that or help me I'm so glad I was willing to be wrong about that now I ask you today are there things in your life that you might need to be willing to be wrong about if we take that to another level are there perhaps things about God that you would benefit from being willing to be wrong about Psalm chapter 34 Verse 8 says taste and see that the Lord is good oh the joys of those who take refuge in him now years ago my friend's cousin was a pastor's kid and she got grounded because she ate all the communion because Jesus tasted so good and this isn't quite that that type of taste but truly if we can learn to experience the goodness of God from God himself we will see that he is good so I want to introduce you to uh the early Church in Acts chapter 8. the early church was the group of people who knew Jesus who were followers of Jesus that after he died on the cross came back to life and went back up to heaven they were left behind to carry out the mission of sharing God's love in the message of Jesus to the people around them this is a group of people that rubbed shoulders with Jesus many of whom met him and heard him or saw him or at least they knew someone who knew someone these are real people out of real time they were devoted to following Jesus and were known as the way or followers of the way unfortunately for them they were real religious people who didn't like them one guy in particular really didn't like them his name was Saul and he was vehemently devoted not to Jesus but to doing anything he could to eradicate the spread of the way and acts 8 verses 1-3 it says this Saul was one of the witnesses and he agreed completely with the killing of Stephen now Stephen was an early church leader and he was killed for talking about Jesus and trying to tell other people about Jesus a great wave of persecution began that day sweeping over the church in Jerusalem and all the Believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria those are just cities some development came and buried Stephen with great mourning but Saul was going everywhere to destroy the church he went from house to house dragging out both men and women to throw them into prison now I don't know how passionate you guys get about things but I've never gotten that passionate right he was as opposed to Jesus as a person could be Pastor Tony Evans referred to him as a religious Bounty Hunter who was trying to put a stop to this group and if we are honest he really should have been the thing is what we know about Saul is that he was a part of a group known as the Pharisees this was a religious group with a strong emphasis on a very strict adherence to the law and enthusiasm for making converts to their way the Pharisee way not the Jesus way the Pharisees actually believed that Jesus was a blasphemer a liar someone who lied about God and lied to about being God so in this way it makes sense that he would be very angry right and so in addition to that he had spent years studying under a man named Gamaliel who was a very prominent religious leader his whole life was devoted to God but the god of the Old Testament not Jesus he didn't believe that Jesus was God he didn't believe Jesus was the Messiah and so what he did is he went and he tried to stop the spread of Jesus now I did ancestry DNA a few years ago and found out apparently I'm one percent Jewish I know that's not that big of a shock to you guys right but I'm one percent Jewish but he is a whole lot more Jewish Saul was wicked Jewish and he was so angry that Jesus would try to say that he was God so he had to stop him for his own belief system right now this religious Zeal was passionate but he was wrong he was wrong in Acts 9 verse 1 it says meanwhile Saul was uttering threats with every breath and eager to kill the Lord's followers so he went to the high priest he requested letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus asking for their cooperation and the arrest of any followers of the way he found there he wanted to bring them listen to this both men and women back to Jerusalem in Chains that's intense but God I like saying that but God Amen now this is one of those crazy I'm glad this didn't happen to me moments in the Bible because what happened to Saul is as he was headed out on this chain up all the Jesus people Mission he actually had an encounter with Jesus that was really crazy in Acts 9 verse 3 through 6 it says as he was approaching Damascus on this Mission a light from Heaven suddenly Shone down around him he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why are you persecuting me who are you Lord as Saul and the voice replied I am Jesus the one you are persecuting now get up and go into the City and you will be told what you must do I'm gonna make a long story short though you can finish it for yourself in Acts chapter 9 but he goes blind and he has to go to a real specific Place find a real specific person do a real specific thing who will also do a real specific thing and then he will not be blind again and this is a moment for Saul where he has to decide is he going to be willing to be wrong about God see he could not follow directions do whatever he wants going the other way other way and just live his life as a blind man or he could be willing to be wrong about God I bet you guys can guess what he did he win he followed the directions and all of a sudden oh my gosh he's not blind anymore because of Jesus as it turned out that he was wrong about God he was really wrong about God but he knew the law but he was spiritual but he was religious but he was a spiritual apprentice and studied under the greatest rabbinic leader but he was wrong his preconceived notions of who he thought God was clouded his ability to see the truth about who God is I'm gonna say that again because that's good his preconceived notions about who he thought God was clouded his ability to see the truth about who God is those of you who know me or have talked to me the last couple months I bet you've been waiting this whole time to say will Pastor Tanisha bring up her glasses first of all yes I will it's my whole personality now second of all it actually I wasn't trying to make this fit but it works really well so talk with me last year on our honeymoon my husband and I were driving in Florida and I'm like loving my life got this little bougie little whip right and listen you can ask him it was a crazy ride I was you know in Florida all the like highways pretty much are 70 miles an hour and I didn't know at the time that I had some um seeing issues and so I'm missing turns we have to turn around all the time I'm pulling yui's where he's not supposed to pull yui's at 70 miles an hour it was crazy right this poor guy and I was like a little embarrassed but I figured hey he stuck with me we're gonna be on the same car insurance soon So eventually you know at least he's not gonna be surprised turns out it wasn't my bad driving it turns out I literally couldn't see and it was very vindicating for me because we went back in March with our kids and I was a much safer experience for him in the passenger seat are you picking up when I'm putting down some of us need to put on some spiritual glasses some of us are walking around with our spiritual eyesight so clouded as to who God really is you're like me blind going around driving like a wild woman 80 miles an hour in a place you never drove before trying to read signs that are way too far away see it's kind of like last week when I went to get my oil change at Valvoline on Saturday and the guy looked at he tested my wipers and he said how do you see anything when it rains there are times in our lives where we have to say let me put on my spiritual eyeglasses and see for real who God is it's we have to be willing to be wrong about the right thing and if anything you want to be wrong about it's your wrong thoughts about God Let Jesus show you who he really is not whatever spiritual thought you have about what you think God should be or who someone else told you God is I want to ask you a hard question as I invite the worship team to come on up are you right is it possible that you might be wrong about God is it possible that there are some things you may believe about God that just simply aren't true I have found as I walk with Jesus that I often am confronted with the idea that my preconceived notions of who God is doesn't always align with the truth of who he is and in those moments when I'm wrong about God I am so glad that I am wrong about the right things I want to share with you a few moments in my life some lessons I've learned over the years when I've learned to be wrong about God it was wrong about this I thought that God was out to get me I thought every time something good was going on in my life and around the corner something bad comes I thought that was God you see these little memes people have said these things before like God only gives his greatest battles to his toughest Soldier that's who I thought God was there are too many blessings in my life there's a curse is coming he's ready to test me here comes Jesus coming around the corner right first of all that's just life and the chaos of living in a sin infested world full of other people with free will in their own chaos in John 16 33 I learned the truth where it says Jesus said I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me here on Earth you will have many trials and Sorrows but take heart because I have overcome the world he didn't say on this Earth imma give you trials and Sorrows he didn't say that he said you will have trials right in John 10 10 when I with the kids I used to tell them this all the time because I wanted them to be able to know who God was and what God was doing in their life John 10 10 says the enemy comes to steal kill and destroy but I Jesus have come to give you a rich and satisfying life so many times in our lives we have something going on we're like well this is God is it is it giving me a rich and satisfying life or perhaps if it's still killing and destroying you is it coming from someone else right thank God I was wrong and I was wrong about this I thought that God wasn't really involved in my life and I didn't think that he had good things ahead of me or that as I follow him he will direct my path in Proverbs 16 9 I learned it says we can make our plans but the Lord determines our steps does that sound like a god who's not involved thank God I was wrong and I was wrong about this I thought I had no place in the church I wasn't gifted or skilled or wanted years ago I had gone on a missions trip I was doing my internship and the pastor sat before me and our group of people and said all right tell me what do you guys bring to the table we have musicians Builders incredible communicators all these people and he comes with me and says all right what do you bring and I said well I can't sing I really can't sing I don't really I'm uncomfortable I'm nervous with people um I I don't really like kids at the time I just was like I have nothing to offer but I can smile it was so insignificant at that moment because I really believe that I had nothing to offer the church but I learned in First Corinthians 12 17 it says now you are the body of Christ and each one of you is a part of it I'm so glad I was willing to be wrong about that and I was wrong about this I thought that God wasn't able to help me through exceedingly difficult situations that were overwhelmingly impossible to walk through but in second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 I learned each time he said this my grace is all you need my power God's power works best in weakness so now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses so that the power of Christ can work through me I am so glad thank God I was wrong thank God I was willing to be wrong about that and to be to say you know what there are some wrong thoughts I have about God please God show me the right way show me the truth and you know what I could go on and on and tell you all the things that I'm wrong about because the reality is that the Bible is full of truth about Jesus and the good news is this God has shown us who he is through giving us Jesus and giving us the Bible they are gifts to us and I'm gonna invite you guys to stand on up this morning see I believe that God wants to shatter these lies today he wants to show you the truth about who he is sometimes those lies Run Deep and sometimes we need God just to Humble us and help us to be more willing to be wrong about the right things so as we sing this last song If you need to come to the altar or spend some time inviting God to dispel those lies that you may believe about him and his character or what he thinks about you we're gonna take the time to do that [Music]", "[Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting thank you for joining us in the series titled you will receive power today we're on day six and our topic is be a witness be a witness what is a witness when you think of the word witness what comes to mind well the actual definition is someone who is a witness to an event we as followers of jesus were called to be witnesses of jesus of the fact that he's alive i have this book here with me and one of my favorite books high adventure in tibet and i love to go back and read the stories because they're so inspirational it's a story about a missionary who goes out to be a witness to take the message of jesus to let people know that jesus is alive but he goes to a place that is so remote and so cold like freezing temperatures i mean think of alaska think of that type of environment with mountains and all kinds of obstacles that he needed to get through to take the message well this missionary decides to leave everything behind and to go and do this work and in one of the chapters he talks about an incident where he fell into a river and you know these are the types of moments that every missionary dreads he fell into an ice cold river and you know there's no technology in these places there's no running water there's no hot water there's nothing you simply go and you go out on a prayer just god please protect me and he fell into a river and this became a critical because his feet could be amputated they could fall off literally that's how that's how freezing cold temperatures are and so he quickly tried to make a fire but the pain was just excruciating and it lasted for several days and thankfully he recovered he healed he didn't lose his feet but what he didn't know because he came to know this about 10 years later is that at that exact moment when he fell into that river halfway across the world in the city of detroit back in the united states there was a little old woman who began to pray and she was in her prayer moment when all of a sudden she was led by the holy spirit to begin to pray for this missionary's feat she didn't know why in fact she had presumed that this missionary was dead because they hadn't heard of him for in a long time what would a strange prompting from the holy spirit to pray for this dead man's feet she didn't realize that he was actually alive but the holy spirit in that moment gave her the understanding to pray for him and that happened to a few other people who who got the same prompting to pray for his feet and so thankfully this man was able to heal again he learned about this about 10 years later when this elderly woman wrote him to tell him what had happened this experience she had in prayer and why am i sharing this with you is because this is what it means to be a witness it means being able to go out into the world overcoming whatever obstacles come your way in order to share the message of jesus and to to share with someone who is far from god this is something that we are all called to do we are called to give evidence to the fact that jesus is alive so after his resurrection jesus has to reorient his followers who at that time were afraid he reassures them that their greatest assignment is just beginning and he sends them out into the world a world that at the time was hostile to their message there was great persecution they were going to have to overcome a lot of obstacles it was going to be tough so they were going to need supernatural boldness and here's the principle that i want to land on it is this jesus promises supernatural boldness to be a witness i'll say that again jesus promises to all his followers supernatural boldness to be a witness that's why he said to his disciples in acts 1 8 but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea in samaria into the ends of the earth think about that this missionary that i mentioned he was literally going to the ends of the earth and some of these places that jesus mentioned here judea samaria you know there were there was a lot of conflict back in that day especially like samaria these disciples were going to face some serious obstacles some serious opposition when i think about these things i'm reminded of a quote from one of my favorite pastors craig rochelle he says we are the church and we exist for the world we exist for the world you know it can be very easy to be a witness on a sunday morning you know after you get out of church it's much harder to be a witness on monday morning when you are surrounded by people who are far from god god wants us to be a witness in the way that we overcome obstacles and the way that we respond to unexpected situations in everything we do we want to be a reflection of god's love and so let that be our prayer today that god let it not just be words let it not just be what i say but let it be who i am let people see a reflection of your love in me jesus help me to bear witness to your life so let's pray right now heavenly father we need you today [Music] we want to be your witnesses we want to bear witness god with our lives that you are alive and well but we know that the world we live in is hostile towards your message there is great rejection god we might even have to face one day persecution for your name there's so much opposition god that if we're going to be able to deliver this wonderful message of the good news of jesus we need supernatural boldness we need power from heaven to step out miracle working power to step into situations god that you're calling us into because there is someone that needs to hear the message of the good news of jesus and we want to be there we want to be available to do that and thank you that you have raised up an army that we're part of that army help us to step out in faith in boldness help me to be the one to bring this message in mighty power not in my own intellect but in the power of the holy spirit we pray these things today in jesus name amen well thank you for joining me today what a wonderful time of prayer please join me tomorrow and make sure you connect and let's agree that god is going to do the impossible we'll see you tomorrow [Music] you [Music] so [Music] you [Music] you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign so [Music] so [Music] you [Music] you [Music] to [Music] [Music] hmm you", "[Applause] all right so you got a you got a good uh uh Bible goal this month The Book of Romans and for those of you that just want a quick crash course there's some favorites uh in the Book of Romans one of my favorites in the Book of Romans is that it is the kindness of God that leads to repentance it's the kindness of God that leads to repentance or how about this one in Romans chapter 3 for everyone has sinned we all fall short of God's glorious standard or another but God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still Sinners or Romans 6 for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord or Romans 8 says so now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus in Romans 10 if you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved amen Romans is uh the the classic place where people that are seeking God they're curious they're intellectually curious about faith and are exploring when they be read the book of Romans it ties it all together and so I want to encourage you to go ahead and jump in to the Book of Romans and read it uh for yourself so next Sunday is Mother's Day and we have a opportunity for you on Mother's day which is to take family photos and so family means a lot of different things it might Bean moms bringing their kids it might mean some hodge podge of people that you've assembled in your life that are your family it might mean some friends it it it it might mean you like doing selfies out there I don't know what it means okay so it means lots of different things but the thing that's different is that we're going to print the pictures out uh for you and you'll be able to pick them up the following week so please uh uh bring those that you consider your family with you for that opportunity I just want to highlight this as well Mother's Day is always complicated much like Father's day and every holiday um uh it's not an automatic win for everybody and so in a in a moment when everybody's going to be talking about how great moms are we we recognize that we should honor mothers and I want to make sure that we do that but we also recognize that there are many who are grieving and it's complicated and I want you to get this is a sign of great spiritual maturity to be able to grieve and honor at the exact same time exactly okay we we don't shut down honoring because we're grieving okay and so uh we need to do both at the same time so I challenge you uh as we lead into Mother's Day and I know that many people like Mother's Day is the worst day of the year for them okay but let's move let's move and grow in that area as well because for many it's the best day of the year and so let's both grieve and honor as we need to do so it was late August 2001 and East Coast International Church was just a few months old at the time we had been in negotiations to purchase what we thought would be our very first uh uh a permanent Worship Center it was the old uh Hoffman's department store on Union Street for those of you you that are old school interns we had made an offer they accepted we signed the papers on the building the first round of papers early on a Wednesday morning in late August professor of architecture from Wentworth Institute of Technology was walking through the building with me uh because they were going to make our future worship center and the whole facility their class project in architecture for the semester after several hours of walking through the building and and making plans we left uh the building and later on that evening the building was set on fire by some teenagers in some type of gang ritual all 85,000 Square fet burned to the ground just to put it in perspective for you this four story build four-story building that we're in uh uh is nowhere near that size uh that building was three times the size of this building now I will tell you as that building burned to the ground I will never forget that night at first as we watched the building burn or as I watched the building burn first there were hundreds of people that came out onto Union Street to watch it burn then it was thousands of people because it lasted a really long time maybe some of you were there that night as people came to watch it burn it burned and it burned and it burned and exploded at one point and people were like whoa and U as the roof collapsed in and people watched it burn and it burned for several days like as the in the rubble the firemen had to like keep water on it because it was burning underground I remember that night stepping back from the crowd and I started to watch the people as the people watched the building burn and they were entranced they were focused like it was just wild as they would chat about like what was happening and they couldn't believe it and they were sharing stories about the Hoffman building and all this all this kind of stuff was going on well my my experience was different than everybody else's experience that night they were watching a building burn I was watching our dreams burn and I remember stepping back as I'm watching the crowd and I thought H God I I don't think that was supposed to happen you know I was like one of those huh that's that's not how it was supposed to happen but the crowd that the crowd was what was intriguing to me the crowd was completely engaged with the fire they were watching it very carefully they're watching the firemen as the firemen battled the Flames to prevent the spreading of of of the uh fire to other buildings because we didn't want another Infamous Lin fire on Union Street and so they they bravely fought it the people were entranced and that's the part that caught my attention because there are moments in life when you are entrance and you're like really want to pay attention to what's going on and to know if something's true or not true there was a time a long time ago when there was another large crowd thousands of people that had gathered together and they were watching really intently and they weren't quite sure what they were watching they weren't quite sure what they were hearing they weren't sure if what they were seeing in front of them was the miracle of all miracles or if they were watching what was about to become a giant dumpster fire they just weren't sure and here they were on the side of this hill next to the Sea of Galilee in Israel and there's Jesus standing and he's speaking and the people were listening to Jesus with full engagement they weren't sure if this was real or not but they sure wanted to believe that it was true they wanted to believe what what this guy was saying they definitely wanted to but it was not like anything they had really heard before it was certainly not like anything they had seen before that Jesus said this and in our continuing series he said this in Matthew chapter 5:7 in what is frequently called the greatest sermon in history Jesus says blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy Amen in this moment when he says blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy there's definitely people in the crowd that day that would have thought Jesus is just messing with us now because no place in the world are the merciful shown Mercy am but Jesus is saying that in his kingdom the merciful will not be marginalized rather they will be the heroes in his kingdom that in his kingdom Mercy is the highest of values and that's a big deal because then and now even to this day people that show Mercy are normally taken advantage of and not giving anything but a whole bunch of which is where the saying comes from no good deed goes unpunished it's it's not like our society's highest value Mercy but what is Mercy anyhow just to make sure we're on the same page Mercy is kindness It's kindness in excess of what might be expected or demanded by fairness it's forgiveness forbearance a compassion it's refraining from harming offenders people that you have the right to harm and choosing not to that's Mercy it's uh think about a car wreck like when there's a big car pile up there's really three types of people at these at these scenes uh the injured of course the people that are injured then there's the self-absorbed people that are worried about the tiny little scratch or dent on their car and then there's the merciful the merciful are those who forget about all the stuff and start to help and assist those that have been injured in any possible way so you have these kind of three groups in God's kingdom Mercy is shown and that's a that's one of the aspect of God's kingdom that's different than the kingdoms of this world Mercy is shown to those that sorrow to those that suffer and to those that are sinful Mercy is shown Mercy shows itself in the desire and actions of those Desiring to make uh the sorrow suffering and sin of others less by so the merciful are on task or on Mission with Jesus and bringing those that are far from God close to God that is Mercy Mercy givers do not um despise others they do not uh despise those that other people reject instead they embrace them amen those that are merciful embrace the poor and those that are merciful embrace the foreigners and those that are Mercy merciful Embrace The Immigrant and those that are merciful embrace the hurting and those that are merciful Embrace those in agony and those that are merciful Embrace those even those that do sinful things that is what Mercy does Amen it Embraces those that others don't embrace our our culture let's just think about our culture for a minute and before we like want to just talk about our culture being the whole best culture in the whole wide world let's pay attention to what our culture really does our culture does not make Heroes of Mercy givers it does it think about what we value think about what we highlight as a culture think about the magazines or or the blogs or the the websites and what what they highlight no they People magazine and teen and Sports Illustrated all these kind of these these influence places what they highlight is those that are the sexiest or those that are the strongest or those that are the meanest or those that make the most money that's not God's kingdom that's not the culture we're supposed to embrace we're supposed to embrace the culture of the kingdom of God now imagine just imagine with me in the Kingdom of Jesus it'll be a little different yeah People magazine in the Kingdom of Jesus Will on the cover have like the 10 most outrageous Mercy givers Sports Illustrated will will cover the 100 most merciful players of the century Forbes Magazine will have the 10 greatest Mercy givers of 2024 the tv shows will be different have lifestyles of the merciful and kind amen College scholarships will be given to the most merciful student in high school that'll be a whole different Kingdom right but that that's the kingdom we're supposed to be establishing right now amen that's supposed to be who we are yes not supposed to be the values that we honor so let me tell you something right now Mercy givers are seldom this is really important to get your head around so you don't you don't get it twisted Mercy givers are seldom selected for the most prestigious Awards by the world standards the mercy givers are afterthoughts second place Runner UPS frequently ignored every once in a while a mercy Giver will break through the noise and every once in a while they'll prick the conscience of a region or a nation or the world think Mother Teresa but after you name maybe one or two more you run out of names we don't as a culture or as a globe give great honor to the mercy givers but in the Kingdom of Jesus they are the heroes so when you are thinking wow I I I want to give Mercy but it doesn't seem like I'm going to get any uh attention for this you're right you won't only from God Amen only from God so the mercy givers are the exact kind of people that Jesus is giving honor to and Jesus is making it clear that Mercy givers will receive the Royal Treatment from God in his kingdom Hallelujah so I want to encourage you today uh uh for those of you that are Mercy givers for those of you in our church that are Mercy givers it's it's something that God has done within you you are the ones who give Mercy those of you who look out for those that other people have forgotten about those of you who embrace the unbraceable those of you who stand with the marginalize those of you who Skip opportunities to advance in order to directly serve the most difficult to serve those who repeatedly forgive those in the midst of chaos pay attention to this for a second you Mercy givers nobody else notices but God notices yes God notices and he says that Mercy is available to you Mercy givers in a very different way Mercy will be shown to you you are what are Matthew 5 Mercy givers Jesus says if you show Mercy In My Kingdom you will have mercy show back towards you by by who by God and His rewards are forever now let's say you're a little rusty at the mercy giving thing like you walked in here today that wasn't like on the top 10 list today to show the most Mercy I want to encourage you to give it a shot amen go ahead and try to show some mercy extend Mercy to those around you for years at the church here we've had a great ministry our transportation Ministry and it was really designed to help those that can't access church or get to church so that they could have Community uh Community of Faith and during the pandemic it really crushed our ability to re to have that Ministry and then to restart it's been really complicated and it's honestly just annoyed me it's annoyed me ever since because it was one of the most merciful Ministries in our church and we stopped it it's like uh so Dan Johansson and I for quite a while have been looking for a nice used shuttle van to purchase and the good news is it's being delivered this week and uh so we're relaunching our transportation Ministry and for those of you that just clapped uh you know you're set up now okay it's going to cost money right it's going to cost money to do this and so if you would like to get to this you can in the church Center app just go to the van uh the van giving opportunity and you can just give to that now but that's not really why I told you that why I told you that is because if this is the kind of thing that like oh I could do that and I could show mercy and this is the kind of thing I would like to do you can sign up for more information on how to volunteer okay uh in the church Center app as well so when Jesus starts he says blessed uh what is this blessed thing anyhow what's this blessed mean people use the word blessed all the time not knowing what it means well a bless means enjoying great happiness yes um this is God's wisdom that when we show Mercy we receive happiness that we receive something from God it's happiness it's joy in another version of what Jesus said it says God blesses those who are merciful for they will be shown mercy so it's God that's doing the blessing so here's the idea it's the rule in our series called the rule not the rule of like the Ten Commandments the rules but the rule this is how the kingdom operates the rule in the kingdom is that the merciful in God's kingdom will not go unnoticed and that God himself takes it upon himself it is his responsibility to bless those who are merciful he that's that's the relationship in his kingdom the merciful will be blessed the merciful will be shown Mercy Jesus said in Luke chapter 6 love your enemies do good to them and lend to them without expecting to get anything back it's a horrible verse then your reward will get and you will be sons of the most high because he is kind to The Ungrateful and wicked all right what help us Jesus says God is kind to The Ungrateful and the wicked that is good news for all of you today right that is great news because the truth is when you were thinking about somebody else was ungrateful and wicked Jesus was talking about you be merciful just as your father is merciful do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned forgive and you will will be forgiven that's a tough verse you can live with that just let it sit human wisdom would say this to The Ungrateful and wicked to your enemy it would say show rage and wrath and revenge and you will feel better if you don't think we think that as a culture oh if we changed our entertainment if we changed what we valued to merciful and kind 80% of the movies on Netflix would disappear right right because they're all about rage and revenge and and wrath God says the opposite he says the merciful will be shown mercy and in this you can rejoice and be happy forever receiving blessings from God because you are merciful and I think in life we really should posture ourselves elves to be as blessed by God as much as possible because it's a tough world to live in and it would rather be blessed than unblessed several years ago we had a a big rainstorm here in Lynn on a Sunday morning 2018 and uh we were having Church on that Sunday morning and our brand new roof that had been installed incorrectly unfortunately uh let more rain into the building than it kept out of the building that day there we are having Church rain's coming in on the fourth floor the worship team's singing songs about Lord send the rain and and stuff and that's true story and we have no idea it's rain's coming rain's coming thirdd floor is flooding I mean thousands of gallons not like for those of you that were here you know what I'm talking about but for those of you that weren't thousands of gallons second floor flooded so the kids we start hearing kids stuff going all of a sudden we see drips happening and I'm like oh man the toilet's on the second floor overflowing or something that's what I thought and I'm like oh no this is the rain this is the rain so like we're still having church I'm pretty intense about having Church no matter what so I'm like I don't care it's raining in the building let keep having church but then then people started freaking out standing up okay I guess we got to pause for a little bit so everybody scattered and went out and all over everybody found any bucket a trash can like a purse like anything that could hold what people were like going around there the solution was let's catch as much rain as possible in the building it was a great day it's actually one of my favorite memories of our church except for the building damage right and so everybody just went to work went to work some people were scared thought they were going to get electrocuted or something fair fair but the uh so everybody was going around collecting uh in buckets all the rain and it really is uh it was a great mem we figured it all out we actually uh were able to have the next service we actually got the building the first floor all set we did have the next service I mean there was thousands of gallons of water and I mean floods all over the place some of your cars I think we had nine cars that were totaled from the flooding outside including mine like it was crazy so it was a crazy day but everybody's going around like catching as much of the rain as possible catching as much of the rain as possible there's a couple lessons we learned that day one stop singing Lord send the rain and Lord send the fire songs all right he's taking us way too seriously way too seriously and second catch all the rain you can the rule in the kingdom is this there are certain things that God blesses in fact Jesus says there's nine things that God blesses very clearly I would suggest that you go and get as many spiritual buckets as possible and let God bless you in those nine areas of of your life get as much of God's blessing as possible Like Rain from Heaven get some buckets and let God fill them up with blessings and one of those places is God blesses the merciful so how do you show Mercy well before you show before we learn how to show Mercy why why should we show Mercy and there's really three quick reasons one is for happiness okay you're blessed you're uh Matthew 5:7 Jesus said blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy we also aren't just bless we don't want to just show Mercy for our own happiness we want to uh show Mercy because if we we want to be shown Mercy James chapter 2 says because judgment without Mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful amen Mercy triumphs over judgment amen and then of course for others we want to be merci for the sake of other people Jude says keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life be merciful to those who doubt snatch others from the fire and save them to others show Mercy mixed with fear hating even to clothing stained by corrupted flesh so there's reasons that we need to be merciful right but how how do you do this how do you actually show Mercy well you you show Mercy because it it starts inside it starts with your attitude first and then your actions it starts with your character who you are and then action it starts with your being before your doing because friends truthfully it's virtually impossible to show True Mercy without being merciful like inside it's an inner transformation that impacts your outer World in fact when you go through this sermon that Jesus is preaching in Matthew Chapter 5 and he says all these blessed are blessed are blessed are blessed those he's talking about all things that need inner work that in his kingdom it is different there is an inner transformation of the heart that leads to exterior conduct so let me walk you through the bible really quickly in the beginning God establishes himself with the people the people of God okay and basically the people of God can go around saying my God's better than your fake Gods right so my God's the best woohoo he'll beat up your God any day of the week kind of that's that's the theme okay so God then God gets a little serious with the people and says okay that's enough of that now you have to start living right and so I'm setting up rules for you in what this means you have hence the Ten Commandments and things like that and so you get this sense that okay now we live by a different standard okay so you have God being awesome then you have this way of this this way of conduct this way of living we do things differently we do things morally we do things ethically there's all of this kind of stuff Hallelujah now we're going we're just fast forward through the Bible clearly after a couple thousand years of this honestly it's not working that's why Jesus came because you can't do the moral ethical things without inner transformation in your heart your heart has to be changed and so that's where Jesus comes in and now it becomes God takes it upon himself to do an inner work on who you are through Jesus Christ and he does the work in us so he shows us mercy and now we are able to be merciful amen because our heart has been transformed this is the the very critical aspect of what's going on sometimes people get this all twisted and messed up they think oh I'll I'll be a Christian in my basic moral thinking but in my with other people but in my private life I'll just go to do whatever I want or I'll I'll do my best to follow Jesus on Sundays and maybe one other day of the week and all the other time that's for me I'll do whatever I want or uh I'll help I'll help with a few good things over here and I'll just like schedule that in but the rest of my life I just going to do whatever I want that really does miss the whole point ites either we allow Christ to have freedom in our life to lead us or we don't and good news for us Christ is patient and kind and gentle he's kind and he won't Force us but he will constantly draw us to the real need of like to the reality that our true need is him for that inner transformation all we have to do is follow all we have to do is follow his lead you see Jesus loves you just the way you are but he loves you way too much to let you stay that way and that's that's that's that back and forth that's that tension that we live in as the worship team comes up if we allow Jesus to forgive us and to lead our lives that that's who we are in that moment deep within it's not just something you do it's who you are amen it's who you are and you can't be merciful unless you have experienced Mercy unless your heart actually is merciful amen what we do our actions is an outflow of who we truly are so when Jesus says in his kingdom blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy what what's happening there is he's saying that in his kingdom hearts are transformed we become merciful it is the value of the Kingdom inner transformation is the goal have your heart changeed from within not pretending but actually becoming merciful the kingdom of Jesus is not uh about smoke in mirrors it's not about taking something ugly and and rotten and just doing like a quick house flip and spray painting over it the other day I was driving I saw this old beat up Mercedes all rusty and nasty and somebody taking some spray paint to it to try to cover it up great still got a lot of issues with that car right the spray paint's not helping but that's what people do with like a pretend Faith they just try to paint it on that's not what Jesus is asking for he's asking for your heart am it's hard to be merciful if you're not actually merciful am so your faith is who you are your actions are a result of who you are why don't you stand with me as we [Music] close there a worship team uh wraps this up today I think there's ways that we could respond I I think it's really critical that we respond to the words of Jesus that in his kingdom blessed are the merciful and recognize that the only way that happens is if we surrender our hearts to Jesus and Let Jesus do the inner work and receive the mercy of God through Jesus Christ so wherever you're at with this today I'd encourage you start there Let Jesus do that inner work to let us become more merciful the altars are open if you'd like to spend some time in prayer [Music]", "\n\n**8.13.19**\n\n**General Notes - Pastor

and you'll be able to see the pictures that we're talking about um we have some exciting news here we have uh men's recovery meeting that we've been working on for a while we are officially starting it on Tuesday night February 27th okay Tuesday night February 27th I said the date wrong like 10 times in the first service so Tuesday night February 27th in El Centro at 700 p.m. this is a 12-step group but it is distinctly Christian in its nature all right so we won't be using generic higher power language it'll be very clear uh that we're talking about Jesus and so it's uh absolutely essential so if uh this is a space that you would like to um come to or or be part of or if you're struggling with some type of Life controlling problem uh over at El Centro Tuesday night starting February 27th is 11 p.m. so we're continuing our series called broke broke I'll notice look at the screen if you would we're making progress right so last week Pastor Jesse had like negative $3,000 and this week it's only $9,000 900 bucks he's making progress he's got little bit in savings a little bit in check making progress there so good job Pastor Jesse back there not true this is not true I'm just making that up all right so um think about the most broke that you've ever been and some of these are funny memories and some of these are painful memories think about the funny memories okay so um some of you have some crazy stories some fun stories that would be interested in hearing but uh one of the the crazy broke stories was when I was younger uh was the field trips with school the school field trips they were the worst because we would drive from my uh back wi town in Indiana all the way over to Indianapolis and we'd go to like a museum or something and all the kids were excited because we're going to stop at McDonald's on the back on the way back but I didn't give you money for McDonald's you had to bring your own money and that was a a less socially emotionally sensitive era in teaching okay so they weren't like checking to make sure like if you didn't have money you didn't get food right that's how it works and so uh I could remember we'd stop at McDonald's everybody be so excited to get off the bus but I didn't have any money so you do what you do which is you go sit and you be a social butterfly and you borrow your friends french fries that's what you do in these you just got go bounce bounce bounce bounce until you until you're full um so I would like to say today uh that we need to move this series is really about helping us to move out of that borrow borrow your friends french fries stage of life into a financially full abundant and free life okay so that's that's the direction that we're heading here there might be a season when you got to borrow your friend's french fries but let's not stay in that season Proverbs chap 11 our theme verse for the series is when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of Joy interesting that there's um two types of rejoicing one for the righteous and one for the wicked like when they when the wicked die the people Rejoice through the blessing of the upright is a city is exalted but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed so we have this idea here that uh when the righteous which hopefully we are becoming righteous are prospering that it benefits all there is peace and shalom in the city and the city can rejoice in the midst of that so that is something that we should be concerned about and something that we should move forward in our life so we're going through four choices that we learn in scripture to live a financially blessed life choice number one was choose hustle over hoping which is just basically work hard uh work and work hard then CH SEC Choice number two is choosing a plan over just your feelings or your passions choosing a plan over passion which means basically get on a budget automate your finances live below your means um and so you're you're moving forward with that and so today we're moving on on to three number three today is this third choice that you can make is to choose discipline over debt tell your neighbor choose discipline choose dis now I I most people when they wake up in the morning when they're looking at their task list for the day it doesn't say discipline myself right so discipline's not a favorite topic but when we're going to become financially free and live in financial blessing we need to choose discipline over debt with over $1 trillion in credit card debt last week we talked about that America's at the highest debt it's ever been for credit card debt over $1 trillion another report came out this week that made it even a little higher than last week we're not going down we're still going up like this it in in in a minute we're going to be at $2 trillion in credit card debt in United States right now the average American has over $6,000 in credit card debt and the fundamental problem with that is that the skill sets that you need to not go into debt are often times the skill sets you need to get out of debt which means those people aren't going to get out of debt unless you get the skill sets that you need okay so if you're one of those people it's okay no shame we're just going to start the process and I can't say that uh firmly enough that there is no shame in telling the truth you tell the truth you be free you make progress that's how this works a couple of years ago a husband and wife came in to see me they were torn up they were a hot mess and the husband they had just told his wife that he was in trouble with some pretty significant things and so he like comes clean and and he just he's so ashamed his head's down the whole thing and once he was done the crying and and the confessing it's all out it's all out there I'm like this is great news this look like what did you hear me right no no like this great news because For the First Time in 20 years you were honest Hallelujah you told the truth now we can do something with the truth we can build a future on the truth you can't build a future on lies you can only build a future on the truth and so part of this is just being honest Jesus said in Matthew chapter 17 he replied um because you have so little faith truly I tell you if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain now think about this $1 trillion doll in debt that's a mountain you could build a mountain out of the coins that would take a trillion dollars right that's we can't even imagine how much a trillion dollarss is let it on a billion or a million it's an enormous amount of money Jesus said if you have faith small as a must she you can say to this mountain imagine all that debt move from here to there and it will move now people get excited about that idea Pastor Kurt are you saying are do I hear you right are you saying that if I have faith I can say to that mountain of financial debt move from here to there I am and it will move Jesus continued nothing will be impossible for you those last two two words there for you I I want you to hold on to that for you nothing will be impossible for you A lot of times when we're thinking about faith and moving mountains what we are hoping will happen is that God will go moving from here to there right we're hoping God does it we're hoping for the $35,000 check in the mail to go from here to there like Lord I prayed I prayed I'm waiting for I'm checking my mail Faithfully every day and if you turn on certain television stations you're going to hear that message but I'm going to tell you right now that most of the time what it means is that God gives you a barrel and a shovel God equips you he authorizes you and empowers you to get to work moving that mountain sometimes he sends a friend sometimes he sends a mentor sometimes he sends some helpers to help you but it is the faith that you have that in fact God is with you in the process of moving this Giant mountain of debt because there is a skill set that you need to learn there's a skill set that I need to learn if God sends us a that that check to kind of bail us out a month from a month later you're going to be back in debt okay that's how it works works that's how it works because you don't have the skill set but when God equips you empowers you and authorizes you and gives you a barrel and a shovel you can just get to work right now it's slow but after you've moved that whole Mountain guess what you're not doing again you're not going to go back so that you have to do this anymore you're going to keep yourself out of debt you're going to start having Financial Freedom and abundance in all the areas of your life so don't despise the barrel and the shovel because that's how you're going to get out of this the problem with dead is this you can never begin to invest in your future when you are in debt because you're paying for your past you can't invest in your future because you're paying for your past you're literally living life backwards you made all these decisions like in your early 20s or and and you're just you're just kind of living the high life doing whatever you want to do everybody else is doing it your friends are doing it everybody everybody's going broke at the same rate and you end up having to pay for your life that you already lived sacrificing your future it's like you're aging yourself twice as fast like financially and you run yourself out of time so that's why debt is such a problem because you're living your life backwards the wrong way this this is how this works on the screen we have uh a beautiful some people think it's beautiful I just think it looks weird but um a $3,000 purse right Louis Vuitton um it was such a nice purse why is it got to have Louis Vuitton all over it I don't understand that but but anyhow 3,000 bucks my guess is when you buy it it's not going up in value after you start using it it's probably not an investment it's like like a luxury item but for some of you whether it be a Louis Vuitton purse or a certain certain pair of shoes certain I'm trying to get the guys in here too certain certain sneakers right right so that that you know you're paying 3,000 bucks we like hold on those things are going to go up in value all right all right whatever the uh but here's the problem when you can't afford this you swipe the card or you go into debt and some capacity you have $3,000 and and you bought it but you couldn't afford it and so you're just going to be like well I'm just going to pay for it over time I'll just put it and you start making the minimum payments on that that $33,000 purse turns into a purse that costs you 8,190 that's what happens okay don't buy the purse right not that one okay not that one why is this so hard we all know this is a problem so far I've not told you anything you didn't know already right you know you already know this why is is so hard because we are sinful in nature all of us you know I'm not just pointing at you and you I it we're all have we're born with original sin we're born already ruined we are born with this thing within us that chooses the wrong things regularly we want the things that we really shouldn't want I call this the law of inappropriate attractions and it applies to like every area in our life every human is attracted to things and either wants or desires or people or whatever happens to be we all have attractions that aren't appropriate we all have attractions that will harm us and not help us we all have attractions that are outside God's plan and God's purposes we all do so the attraction itself self is universal what we do with it is what matters okay and so because of our sinful nature it is hard for us to do these things so our sinful nature is literally fighting against us trying to keep us in debt trying to keep us from being financially free so our self is working against us as is society Proverbs chap 22 says this the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is slave to the lender for real friends the rich rule over the poor during the pandemic the wealthiest people in the world which is this is a handful of people their net worth increased at over a million for every $1 that your increase netw worth worth was so for every dollar you increased they increased over a million dollars oh that's that helps you understand kind of that we have a complicated system right it's complicated and it's broken and it's difficult so it's really important that we do the basics really well so that we're not stuck in a really problematic state it is a modern broken economic system and it takes discipline to not go into debt it takes discipline to choose not to go into debt reality is we're failing at a rapid rate as a culture because of instant gratification and convenience somebody say convenience convenience now this is the new one 20 years ago if I preach this message convenience really wouldn't have been in in the theme but convenience is suddenly a major reason that people go into debt okay convenience of uh remember when you used to have to go to Blockbuster for those of you that aren't old enough to remember that you like would like it was Friday so on the way home from work or after you ordered your pizza you would go you would go down and you go to Blockbuster spend 45 minutes picking out a movie they getting a home it was a horrible movie that it was complicated okay but it was a whole process and then there was Netflix subscriptions like in the mail stuff and now you're watching online and you're like you ran out like you watched all the Netflix shows you watched everything on Amazon Prime you watch now you got to order peacock and AMC and like you have so many convenient subscriptions that you you lose track of how much money were actually spending on these things it's so convenience is a major issue another issue that's happening is things very simply think about Uber and Lyft and door Dash and all these things right I'm coming after every body today don't worry I'm coming after everybody all right think about errands okay the rental places you know I mean the these are designed to keep you in poverty okay all this stuff because it's not conspiracy theory stuff this is just how finances work so when you choose convenience okay in these moments you're actually driving yourself into debt you're like oh but I need that Uber to go like three4 of a mile do you but it's raining make another plan get a friend you know do something here's what's going on we are treating time like it's more valuable than money don't treat time like it's more valuable than money until it actually is and here's how you know if something saves you 10 minutes of time and cost you $100 then your time time had better make you more than $100 for that 10 minutes so if 10 minutes you can make $200 fine save the time but if it doesn't check yourself stand up drive to Blockbuster or whatever it happens to be whatever the thing is okay Romans chapter 13 this is a fascinating verse because there's this uh weaving of faith and finances in it Romans 13 8 says give to everyone what you owe them if you owe taxes pay taxes not going to land there but it said what it said if re if Revenue then Revenue if respect then respect if honor then honor let no debt remain outstanding except for the continuing debt to love one another for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law Hallelujah the passage is interesting because the author is integrating this conversation about money and faith he's he's weaving it together to be good at one you need to be good at the other to be good at finances but not faith is not enough to be good at Faith but not finances is not enough because they're connected it's like a double helix on the screen you have this idea one strand is Faith one strand is finances and they are interconnected they impact each other or rather it it's that there is this especially unique connection between how we approach finances and how legitimate our faith actually is it's one of those things that gives us like a a a thermostat it's it's I mean a thermometer of sorts it it's like a checkup we can check ourselves to see how we're doing like which God are we serving the god of money or the god of the universe right which which one it kind of helps us in fact if you've ever if you've never given yourself a spiritual checkup like to see how you're doing I'm going to give you five ways right now really fast that you can self assess how you are doing spiritually there's five things and you can just scale yourself one to 10 how am I doing one being bad 10 being amazing so the first one is and there these five GS Grace growth groups gifts and good stewardship there's five things the first one is Grace what this means is that have you accepted and embraced the grace of God through Jesus Christ have you asked Jesus to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life have you joined the family of God through Jesus that's what it means and if you've done that are you now helping others to experience the grace of God right so that's all there like you can just check the box how am I doing with that Grace growth is are you making spiritual progress and taking person responsibility for that growth and are you able to self resource yourself so that you can grow spiritually third is group are you in A discipleship oriented relationship with other followers of Jesus you see this is how you know this is one of those major categories see everybody needs to be in biblical Community but biblical Community is not just hanging out with each other it's both fellowship and discipleship it's both and this is a challenge for most Christians you see every group every Community every church is supposed to be both a family and an army every group every Community every church has two distinct functions a family function where we care we have compassion we celebrate and we tell the truth like that's the family side the military side is is freedom justice healing and Truth also so it's this two- side we're supposed to be both at the same time and that's that's critical so group how are you doing with that gifts this is meaning you've identified your god-given gifts and you're using them to the glory of God and to the benefit of other people so identifying and use how are you doing then fifthly is good stewardship this is getting into the financial space are you experiencing Financial freedom and are you able to joyfully honor the biblical Financial ethics and directives of scripture how are you doing again I can't answer that for you you can look at these things and see how you're doing and then you can decide here's where I'm at this is where I need to improve and this is where I can Excel what's interesting about these five is that they are all interconnected like that double helix idea or the staves on a barrel every one impacts the other and so we're working on all of them at the same time raising our making progress with them so here's the action step for choosing discipline over debt today this is this is really simple this is not going to like surprise you that I'm saying this it is simply to radically cut your expenses and increase and pay down your increase your savings and pay down your debt okay how do you do that real practical here real practical First buy used why do you need to buy new things some things you want to buy new I'm not saying go buy used underwear but but but you know you got to do what you got to do the um but for real Ed cars just fine use lots of things just fine this is why thrift stores exist particularly the lofted STS in but the uh so second eliminate eliminate every I'm going to hide in a second I'm afraid I'm going to get things thrown at me but the uh eliminate at least one streaming service just like you literally that might be the most important spiritual decision of your life today is is just clicking cancel right okay second plan your meals and I mean third plan your meals and snacks um fourth shift the way you do coffee five downgrade your cable plan people when I try to help people with this I'm like let me see your cable bill and they're like they drop their head like I know I could have set my college for my kid to college for free but I wanted cable right pay no more than $30 a month for your phone plan your cell phone plan so somebody got one good good um here's one order your groceries online and pick it up don't deliver it okay for real everybody listen this is now proven it's been around long enough that they've proven it if you order your groceries online you will just order what's on your list oh right unless you're a psycho right so so you're just gonna you're just going to order what's on but if you go in person with your list like it do you know what happens when I go to the grocery store so I can go to the grocery store in person for a a $7 item I I will walk out of that store with $77 in snacks all right that's what's going to happen if I go order groceries online pick them up don't have them delivered that's a whole another area of financial chaos always the things like coupons and stuff like that of course are still around choose cheaper Hobbies if you have hobbies that are very expensive it's okay to say hey I know I want to treat myself but I need to get out of debt first I'm going to choose cheaper Hobbies car pool like take the extra effort to make sure you get out of debt and that you can work on the the the fundamentals then of course make extra money like how do you just make extra money well there's lots of ways to make extra money okay we live in an economy that allows you to do that but when my wife and I were going through this process several years ago I mean back when building 19 was around for those of you that are real iners you know what building 19 is I would go down every Monday I would buy things I would post them on eBay and sell them that week and we would make hundreds and hundreds of dollars a week to get out of debt and then lastly and this is this takes a discipline here that's hard and this is stay in your lane stay in your lane what does that mean that means don't try to live somebody else's life live your life excel at your life excel at what's in in your in your lane and stay out of somebody else's Lane chances are their Lane is making them broke so there's no need to go in their Lane why wife and I don't try to live somebody else's life my wife and I recently went on a short vacation we went down to Florida for a few days and you know how we decided this we we looked because Google helps you look at this stuff we looked and found the week that it was cheapest to fly we chose the cheapest week to fly in the year so we left on Sunday after church which was also the cheapest time on that particular thing to fly we flew down we borrowed a a car we stayed at my parents condo we bought groceries at the grocery store made coffee at home basically it cost us less to go on vacation and to live our regular life okay so it was it was absolutely wild what well could we have done something else could we've gone and done something that some people might think is cooler we could have but we stayed in our lane and it was perfectly fine it was it it was it was an ex excellent time because we have other Financial priorities idea here is this stay in your lane choose discipline over debt and if you need help getting started okay we have something for you here Carla Stephanie why don't you come on up [Applause] please I I wasn't sure if I uh they probably thought I wasn't calling them up sorry about that the uh all right oh man all right Stephanie and Carla uh why don't you introduce yourselves to everybody I'm Carla what's I'm Stephanie all right oh you wanted me to say that I don't know like a little background who are you oh I'm Carla make make make that touch your chin just touch your chin with it that much um yeah I'm Carla I've been in L for a really long time the blue one blue can you turn it on there we go yep go ahead hello oh look at that all right so I'm Carla I've lived in Lynn ever since I've lived in Lynn for over 20 years um and you guys have known each other for 20 years you ladies 20 years this year actually I was talk it is it is we met 20 years ago yeah and I'm Stephanie and this is my best friend Carla that's what she wanted me to say yes you missed your chance you missed your chance okay so Cara and Stephanie uh are in our a group that we have here at the church it's a financial cohort group that uh tell us about this financial cohort group all right well a little I want to give a little background for cuz I think it's important but this idea of the cohort it goes back to around 2018 and um I found myself in a really tough tough financial situation and just have been doing it my way whatever that way was I actually can't even remember my way of doing money um and I'm a single mama so single Mama's out there what's up um and it was tough and I'm like I can't do this by myself so my best friend who I really trust I just brought her in and had her look at what was going on and kind of what was the pivotal point was even doing like a financial inventory I'd never even done that so we did that together and came up with a budget and when I tell y'all we use colorcoded pens it was just red every week just every week red red red red so depressing but the point was like keep going like just cuz there was red we just kept going we kept meeting and changed some some things of the way I did things and she got a front row seat to God being so awesome like just the math okay the math did not make sense and over time we just we saw Miracle after Miracle after miracle and hard work y'all like discipline and hard work and miracles and so yeah it was awesome to bring my best friend in to that so part of the moving of mountains and having faith is that God equips you authorizes you empowers you to like start moving the mountain but along the way it's like he throws these bonus miracles in right that's 100% true that's what really happens in in these situations so tell us about your experience here with all this with the cohort cohort um so in our corts in our cohorts um we just take time because we're not you know in the cohort doing this know all like we know everything and we are um perfect you know in our finances um we are actually doing the things with um the people in our groups and so in there um we do budgets together we um hold each other accountable uh because we have found that like you know you can make a budget and like toss it you toss it or you forget about it or you I don't know you look back give up once one week doesn't make sense and so we just come together um there's you know things that like Stephanie might be you know doing great in in her group like meal planning you guys she got the meal planning down okay cuz I was the person that went to the store with a list and bought all the snacks instead but meals um things like you know I'm not sure why this you know I'm make I'm spending more than I'm I'm making and so we're able to do that together and then hold each other accountable because um when you have you know somebody else to answer to or um sharing your wins or what wasn't working you are likely to stick to them more than if you kind of are like keeping it to yourself you won't you don't you don't hold yourself accountable but if there's other people there you will so what are some of the challenges you face inside the cohort like what's hard to do so I will say one of the things that we covered uh in the classes that we held before the cohorts started um was about being honest and so we just wanted to like kind of say from the beginning you know for me and Carla she's my best friend so it was very easy to do that but you don't have to be best friends to share about finances like money talk is spiritual talk and so we breaking that boundary first that mindset like breaking that mindset that money is doesn't have to be this Hush Hush thing it doesn't have to bring shame like shame stays outside it's not welcome here so uh just being honest I found that uh people talking to other people about money was a very strange concept and so when we broke that I feel like we made a lot of progress so it's it's not a free-for-all though right so it's not a free-for-all like where people can say whatever dumb money idea they have right there's a there's a focus there's a there's a very intention intentional way that that we're moving people forward on this and it's a real question uh is it working it is definitely working um we you know we take an inventory of like hey like where are you financially do you have an emergency fund where is what is your debt and we create these goals where we like added our totals where you know where do we want to be in a few months in a year and we saw people uh build their emergency fund we saw people um even if it was like you know somebody like saved this like a little bit of money and they were like I just save this much but that's a win you probably didn't even realize that you would have done that if you didn't you know write your budget down um we paid off debt a lot of people were paying off debt and so we it's probably been like three months maybe um and we were able to see those changes so we're excited to see you know by the end of the year what that looks like so I don't I actually don't know who's in the cohort except for the people that have come up on stage so far um but I do know that uh the total debt has come down several thousand and emergency funds has gone up significant ific L and so the two major things the two major levers for your life financially are those two at the beginning and so that's that's working in a way that before wasn't working when we were just doing like sermons and classes people like that's awesome I should do that right never right so someday this is the way to say okay now I can actually do it and I have help doing it okay good good all right so how do people get part of this become part of this so you can sign up for the uh fre classes so first we do these uh four weeks I believe it is four weeks of Freedom classes where we go over a lot of principles that you may have not heard of um why we're even doing this in the in the first place we're not just trying to be millionaires just to be millionaire want to be financially free um for many reasons but in this group you'll go over all of those things like then we have a budget cohort so there's two parts to this and the budget cohort will basically put into uh practical steps or like action what you learned and so in there we will get down and what was saying get financially naked is the word or like really get to work on those principles like really just uh put those things down and how to actually become free because doesn't it sounds pretty but it's not actually pretty to actually get it done good thank you thank you appreciate [Music] it all right right all right the worship teams can come on back up we'll wrap up here the thank you Carla and Stephanie and thank you for the all those of you that are in the cohort uh for this kind of first round of it um we we really do think that we are going to move this forward we're g to we're g to for anybody that wants to move forward in this this is a way for you to move forward the for those of you that for whatever reason it's

I want you to understand that uh good Community Development is just is justice uh like what we were talking about what is a good Community what is a good neighbor and these kinds of kinds of things this is a space that we've been in for quite a while we've been asking these kinds of questions as a church of how do we impact our community holistically how do we bring Justice how do we bring transformation uh several years ago we literally went and we interviewed a hundred people that lived in downtown Lynn and said what would you like us to do with the front of the building and 100 people said we would like a cafe and so we built a cafe like what if they had said we wanted like a nightclub we would not have built a nightclub but we might have said look besides that what else um but we uh we we did that we we've asked our self questions over the years what are the big Community needs there's a big we have the largest homeless popular largest young adult homeless population in the state uh here in the city like what do we do about that so we created something for homeless young adults uh housing is an ongoing issue we all know this everybody every survey that's done in a city land housing housing housing housing that's what it is we're building 24 housing units upstairs uh which is just one amazing story after another there's a fun story that I will tell you that the broader Church doesn't know yet is that on Monday we got notice unexpectedly like it was we thought this would be like four or five years from now uh we applied um in partnership with another organization we applied for three million dollars we did not get it to start a homeless young adult Youth Shelter and the reason this is important is we need a shelter we need case management and we need long-term housing we need all of them to make a dent on homeless young adults in the city so we need all of those we thought because we're still pretty new at this it would be years before we got this money so we got notice on Monday that uh HUD uh this is federal money just awarded us 2.37 million dollars for that project so now the money is cool right you're like Wahoo they were like uh we weren't planning on doing this for four years now we got to put together this shelter we got to take care of all this okay so but this is an actual need right this is a need that our community has we acknowledge it as a need we need to do it we need to separate homeless young adults from from older homeless adults for a variety of different reasons but this is a big big step forward we identified uh with the community that we lack good affordable retail space we don't have good retail space in Lynn we don't have a stores that are affordable and so we decided we should do something about that and so we have and so that's the Loft at Stetson it's one of the most beautiful stores in the city of Lynn it might some people would say it is the most beautiful store in the city then but I'll let those people say that um and that is our job Justice oriented job creation um it's not about making money that's not the point but we'll make money but it will be for the purpose of uh creating jobs uh for ladies in recovery coming restarting life re-entering life and particularly those that have felony records it's very complicated to get living wage jobs and so we're doing some of this stuff and so I want you to live with this texture some of us need to lock into something like that and we're going to serve or we're going to help make it happen others of us are positioned in a place in our life where we need to do the creating of it so you have what you you can serve in one side or the other but but we can all serve in it and uh and when I I recently met with the mayor and asked him you know what do you see what do you see the city being and one of the things that they're trying to do right now is bring biotech to Lin they want to do this thing I'm like I got a couple of guys in the church that do biotech stuff um but these are the kinds of things whatever it is that you do don't discount what it is that you do what your skill sets are what your gifts are you might have the thing that's going to radically make our community even more just in a way that's surprising to you and so uh if God's doing something in you listen listen to it listen carefully listen carefully all right Bishop power come on back up come on back up [Applause] I want to ask you in a moment when I come to the close of this session to join me uh on stage um for the uh for the Q a um this last session is just where do we go from here right where do we go from here if we leave today and we just have a notebook full of notes we wasted a great Saturday and land we got to put some action steps and we got to move forward and so there's a there's a document um actually oh you got one okay I've got it uh here as well just I I took Kyla's but I think she's got a replacement there's a document that you'll see moving forward but before I get to that I just quickly want to kind of uh summarize some other I think potential action steps things like breathe non-toxic air you know when I talk about breathing non-toxic air remember I talk give the illustration of growing next growing up next to a steel factory so we've got that in US by being racialized in America so we got to breathe some new air which means we got to put ourselves into spaces like this right because that's taking the spec out today uh you know something else might be you know um put yourself in a position where you're the minority right that's going to take another spec out because maybe the other places that you have been racialized into have subconsciously taught you to think as if you're the superior you know Supreme so breathe non-toxic air uh read uh authors who are not from your dominant culture group right you get a different perspective watch a different News Channel right I'm not I'm not okay this is like three prominent ones NBA MSNBC CNN Fox News right so maybe get your news from another source maybe get your news from The Source from the enemy you know from the ones who are really tearing stuff up and you know destroying the fabric of our society breathe in different air get in the you got to get in another room right uh commit to be anti-racist and again I say it most people I believe majority of people are not racist racist racism is different than how you feel about a person racism is pride I'm sorry is Prejudice plus power and so by committing to be anti-racists it means that wherever I see where racism Prejudice plus power has been used to create systems that are creating pain anti-racist is I'm committed to dismantling that system that's what it means to commit to be anti-racist wherever you see it I'm attacking it because that's that that's is getting in my lungs and in the lungs of other people it's kind of causing me to continue to breathe the toxic air so we got to commit to be anti-racist pray for Revelation 7 9 pray for God's vision and dream he wants a family that looks like uh he wants the family on Earth to look like the family in heaven John said every tongue tribe nation and people group and let's pray for that and then let's get up off our knees and let's work to be the answer to our prayer uh acts 10 9-20 is another example this is The Narrative of Peter right Peter was a real person but Peter went through a process of getting the racism out of his heart the Prejudice out of his heart y'all know Peter's Journey right Acts chapter 9 uh he's he's killing Christians Acts chapter 8 he's committed to the death of Stefan holding the clothes by when the people Stone him uh uh Paul not Peter yep thank you it was Paul in Acts chapter 9 and it's acts acts 10 I'm talking about um talking about Peter thanks for that correction so in in uh nine Peter's On The Rooftop and he has his vision of these unclean animals from a Jewish perspective non-kosher animals so Jews would never eat kosher Jews would never eat pork so Peter has his vision he's hungry he falls asleep he's a trance and he starts smelling bacon man there's nothing like the smell of bacon even if you don't like bacon you don't like to taste the smell of it it's like smelling coffee right he starts smelling bacon and then he starts smelling some barbecue ribs and start seeing a vision of barbecue and then a smothered pork chop floats in his dream and it's like he's never eaten any of that ham sandwich and the vision says Rise Peter slain eat no Lord I've never eaten anything unclean and so God has taken him through a process right you shall not call unclean that which God has has made clean right you're not in the position to judge who God chooses and how he uses them years ago I was the president of the Christian male chauvinist Club unofficial club that I started right I'm the only one in here and I didn't believe that women could preach they could pastor I didn't believe that women could be an elder in a church you know or a deacon into church but you know God gave he took me through a process just like he did Peter and he was still working on Peter in Galatians chapter 2. because when Peter went to cornelia's house and Cornelius was a gentile and he probably he was free to eat all that stuff and you know Peter began preaching and the Holy Spirit fell on them in Acts 10 just like it did on Acts chapter 2 and Peter's like well I discern that God's not a respecter of persons and they received the Holy Spirit just like we did let's baptize them in the name of the father son the Holy Spirit by the time we get to Genesis 2 Peter is still in this racialized society which is called Judaism which had this superiority to the Gentiles and as as Peter is in the city of galatia and he's eating that with Gentiles through Paul's Ministry because Paul was the ambassador to the Gentiles Peter to the Jews that all of this bacon and ham and pork chops and and barbecue all these unkosher foods are being served and Peter is man he got barbecue sauce on his robe and bacon grease on his lip and he's just enjoying it until there's a knock on the door and these Jewish Brothers show up and Peter pushes himself back from the table wipes the barbecue sauce off his face and you know looking real Angelic and Paul sees what's going on and then he sees Barnabas son of encouragement drop his fork and hide the barbecue sauce under the tables like I didn't do anything wrong even Barnabas was being racialized and being pressured by society and Paul rebukes him to his face and says you are wrong so we need multiple touches of this you're not done today every day do something that's going to get that out your lung get it out your soul every day and that's what we see happening you remember I think it's in Mark 8 there was a blind man that that his friends brought him to Jesus to heal him and Jesus Took the blind man and took him away from his comfort zone he took him away from his friends took him outside the city and the man was blind but he could hear because he started hearing Jesus go all right put some dirt in the spit it's like wait a minute Jesus I asked you to heal me what are you doing I can't see you but I know that sound and he wipes it on the Man's eyes and Jesus asked the man what do you see so the man went from total darkness so now I can see men but they're like trees in other words I see Shadows I gotta you can't have a shadow unless you got a little bit of light okay so he went from total darkness to a little bit of light and then Jesus did it again said now what do you see he said now I can see perfectly sometimes we need multiple touches you don't just get it in one and that's why it's a step I say just don't stop don't get exhausted remember earlier I said white people have to develop a stamina for this black and brown people have been doing it all their lives don't quit don't get exhausted don't get tired of the conversation plug up the holes in Our Gospel There's a Hole In Our Gospel and the whole in Our Gospel is that we've compartmentalized the gospel that Jesus is only concerned about spiritual things let me let me tell you this is spiritual it's not just is this is not the only spiritual thing on here all of this is Spirit there's no compartmentalization this is not all secular and this is the only thing spiritual but this is what the church has prioritized we get we get one day a week and we give the devil six to have dominion in every one of these no we have a Dominion mandate according to Genesis 1 27 28. our Dominion is over all the Earth it's in every system right the spirit of The Sovereign God is upon you so we got to plug that hole up in our gospel that God doesn't care about housing that God doesn't that we ought to be pro-life right when the baby's in the womb but when the baby comes out this is what they got to deal with we need to be pro-life from the womb to the tomb oh we've got to live here so we got to plug the holes up we got to go beyond racial reconciliation to racial Justice we have to celebrate the assets of ethnic and language groups we have to increase our cultural competency our CQ increase your cultural competency get more knowledge develop more skill have a heart and a willingness to apply those skills we have to extend welcome and embrace others that are different than you and one of the ways that churches specifically can do that is by praying planning and programming for the presence of the other the other those that are not in the dominant culture pray for them plan for them and program for them come out of your dominant cultural perspective that this is how this is the standard of whatever right it may not be their standard it doesn't mean that yours is better and theirs is less but plan for the presence of the other be intentional and go beyond the societal Norm organizational rules in the comfort zone this is something that really can apply to organizations like the Assemblies of God or a district or an office right sometimes we got to break the rules right who set the rules right if this rule had never been broken like a brown people would never have gotten a mortgage and gotten in into the house of their dreams sometimes you got to go beyond organizational rules find a friend a mentor and submit to them this is just my theory I I haven't found a scripture to back it up yet but my life experience has been that I think there's something about struggle and oppression that expands your soul I could probably find a scripture to back that up but expands your soul and so the most flexible forgiving and loving and kind and patient and gentle people that you'll ever meet are majority black brown yellow and red because they've been catching hell for a whole lot longer and if my Anglo brothers and sisters really want to expand your soul find a friend that's not like you submit to them ask them to Mentor you it puts you in this position where you are now not Superior but you're in a position of submission and learning and it's in the position of submission that the grace of God is poured out I think that expands your soul and you begin to understand we're talking about I was talking to my friend Kyla how and I think you all experienced this too someone like man I never knew that I never knew that I didn't know they did I didn't know they felt that way there's something about being in that environment where you're learning about the other that it increases your knowledge not just increases your knowledge but when you step into a relationship through genuine authentic friendship and relationship it expands your soul because what you have all you know is all you know but all you know is not all that there is to know so don't think that I've cornered the market I know no you don't even know half if you would step out of the comfort zone and let this culture teach you you understand what I'm saying Pulpit exchanges something that pastors often do to expose their congregation to the other walk alongside the other in their struggle make their struggle yours we saw that happen uh freely during the uh after the death of George Floyd right most of the people who are Marching were white I was like man I'm glad y'all are here I'm tired I'm gonna sit down go ahead and carry the banner you use the bull horn this time thank you where y'all been right they've made their our struggle theirs finally until they got tired right until another issue came up then they went back to the suburbs and you know we were still we still dealing with systems uh and then there's all of this on here right um somebody read one to really Pricks your heart what number six number six don't blame anti-christian groups for doing what the church has been called to do don't blame black lives matter organization for having a message of love your neighbor as you love yourself they're not saying that but they've been demonstrating it and then the church wants to come along and condemn the organization because of other uh practices and strategies and systems within their organization but the church had been given a message first love your neighbor as you love yourself don't blame Black Hebrew Israelites or any other Organization for creating a narrative or taking over a narrative that we have been given into scripture right that's what that means what else recognize this as spiritual warfare number four our battle is not flesh against flesh and blood is it no it's principalities and powers and for us for years for centuries the deal racism is a sin racism is a sin the devil takes captive people to do his will he needed some folks to design a system called race to do his will it's spiritual warfare now we have to rebuke folks in the natural right Jesus Peter get behind me Satan many times have to correct his disciples you know confront them face to face we do it in love you recognize that the source of all sin is is its desires that are within us maybe it's fear maybe it's pride and the devil Taps into those those proclivities and fears and weaknesses that we have within us and it manifests in sin that's what James says don't say you're tempted by God every man is tempted and enticed and drawn away by his or her own lust so there's some the devil knows what's in you that's weak and he pulls on that and if it's if it's inferiority or for its fear or if it's Pride or whatever he will use that as a doorway uh to sin I heard this one statement about Temptation and it's based on that James 1 scripture it says whatever you like to devour the devil will try to devour you with that that whatever you like to devour that's your own lust that's your own dry that's the thing that you like be careful the devil will try to devour you with that you said number four as well right number 12 say what needs to be said stand up speak up for the truth preach Jesus Injustice ooh that a preach right there you know there's many pastors and Pastor Curt you probably can bear wins to this that after George Floyd and Brianna Taylor or any instance of Injustice they're not touching this they see this as political they see this as spiritual we're just going to preach the gospel There's a Hole In Our Gospel though and then many were afraid because they were losing members and losing tithes and attendance was going down and they don't want to rock the boat and then the people who were catching hell it's like hey they not saying nothing I think I'm in the wrong track tribe I think I'm in the wrong place you know they they were just holding my hands and embracing me that's reconciliation but when we dropped our hands and we left and I went out there there's nobody with me now I think I need to go back to another church maybe that looks like me or that Embraces the issues that I that I have does that make sense who else what is another one number eight that's what you were going to say reject the idolatry of race and embrace the identity and image afforded To Us by Grace the idolatry of race that there is something called angloid caucus or caucasoid mongroid and negroid that's idolatry man-made race as a system to justify the mistreatment of people that were not Anglo to economize and profit offer their land and offer their labor see them as personal property and in order to justify that we need to create a delineation I think somebody found a skull in uh in some northern part of Europe and the skull was supposedly perfect and you know the theory is that this is a white person's skull then they found a skull in Africa sub-Saharan Africa and it was a little bigger and you know the bone structure and and they you know this this person is close to an ape they're less than you know the European skull and that that really was the foundation for this this idolatry of race and when we give loyalty and Allegiance to that which is that human constructive race we're denying the grace of God we're denying the image of God we're putting ourselves in the position of God as if we're better than anybody else we're not no we're not you might be more privileged Warren Buffett said this Warren Buffett said listen if I were born at the same moment the same day the same year as a person in Bangladesh was born and Warren Buffett is a white man Warren Buffett said I've just won the lottery merely because of the fact I was born in America and they were born in Bangladesh so they are automatically born in poverty and I'm born in wealth even the poorest person in America is richer than 90 percent of the world because 90 of the world lives on less than two dollars a day come on you can Panhandle two dollars a day two dollars an hour if you want to you're rich in some places so we have to reject the idolatry of race and being anti-racist means that wherever I see the idolatry of race being manifested in privilege and Power that's just creating disparities I have to reject that I have to call it out like Paul called out Peter what else 13 to be a last one and Pastor Kurt come join me up on the platform we can do some q a work to repair broken systems alongside the people suffering under the weight and affected by those very systems work alongside that's a key word to work alongside can I just be honest with you all it's difficult for white males to work from the back or to work alongside there's because racialization has created a tendency and and even Anglo culture has created a tendency for individualism and so it's not uh Cooperative that's not natural for white anglos especially males to be cooperative is to be competitive and it's to be individualistic that's part of the culture um so to work alongside means you really have to come out of your comfort zone you have to increase your CQ in order to do that and it denies something on the inside of you that you naturally want to do and to me it's kind of like the principle of tithing I think God wants us to tithe but go beyond tithing to generosity the reason that the principle of tithing is important is that tithing breaks the spirit of greed off of Our Lives because God says he wants a he he whenever he asks us to do something it's not to take away but it's always to give us more and what the principle of tithing does it's a doorway for God to give you more and so tithing meets first of all face to face with fear and with greed am I am I going to give God the first 10 of this income and when you do it breaks the spirit of Mammon off of your money and Mammon is a spirit of the world that's on money and God and Jesus says you can't serve God and man you cannot serve two masters so tithing breaks that Spirit off of you in the same way submitting yourself as a majority culture person to somebody that's in the ethnic minority he can break that Spirit of superiority off of you", "[Music] hey friends welcome to our week of prayer and fasting you're listening to pastor dave i'm here recording this directly from my home so welcome and i want to give you a breakdown of our week and what's going to be happening what we're going to be doing well essentially this entire week every morning we're going to be releasing a clip like the one you're listening to now that is essentially a time of prayer it's a time where we hope to meditate on some scripture and give you some direction as you as you begin to pray so it's kind of like a launch pad and this will hopefully will help you as you are praying throughout the day this week our theme is going to be you will receive power that's what we're going to be talking about we're going to get deep into what that means and um before we get started i just want to let you know that whenever we talk about fasting if you're newer with us what we're really talking about is we want to make more room for god we are setting aside something in our lives to do that to make more room for him so often times it's easy to make room and we make room for things all the time but to fill that space up with more of god more prayer more meditation more you know more scripture that's the challenge and so i want to challenge you to be intentional about that it's not just about you know not eating or not partaking in something it's about going deeper with god so i want to challenge you to do that i want to encourage you that god has so much more that he wants to do in our lives so let's be open to that i also want to make you aware of some tools that will be really helpful they've certainly helped me and i would encourage you to use them the first a tool that i want to talk to you about is the bible making sure that you have a bible near you is so essential because as much as god wants to hear from us and we have many things that we want to bring before him our needs our requests things that we're inviting him to do as much as we want to do that we also want to hear from him so having a journal making sure you're writing down whatever god is prompting in your heart is super helpful and if you're like me if you like to get ahead and have an edge i want to give you the two scriptures that we're going to be talking about this entire week we're just going to be focusing on that the first scripture is acts chapter 1 verse 8. that's the book of acts as an acts of the apostles chapter 1 verse 8 and then the second one is luke 24 49 so that's the gospel of luke chapter 24 verse 49. i would encourage you to take some time today to read them and meditate on them and think about what god is telling you through them and the second thing that i would encourage you to get number one is the bible and number two is to identify a place where do you want to meet with god this week for some of you that may be your vehicle maybe to and from work is the perfect time for you to meet with god for others of you it might be the beach brothers of you it could be the side of a mountain maybe you want to go on a hike into the woods or maybe you want to just pray and meditate in your room whatever works for you whatever you have to do to get along with god make sure you take some time to do that last but not least we want to make sure we're intentional about spending time with god so i would encourage you to take those moments that you want to spend with god and put them in your calendar pick a specific time a specific day when you want to do these things and then let other people know that you'll be unavailable during those times so hopefully these tips are helpful finally i want to leave you with the theme for this week you will receive power it's actually a promise some words that jesus spoke to his earliest followers and it's a reminder to all of us that no matter what god is calling us to if god is calling us to do it then it is supernatural and if it is supernatural then we're going to need supernatural power to accomplish it so prayer plays a huge role in that and we want to make ourselves available why don't you pray with me right now god we just want to set this time apart for you as we begin this week as we prepare to meet with you and bring our request before you and invite you to intervene in our lives to bring about your kingdom god before any of that we just want to say thank you for making yourself available for wanting to have a relationship with us for allowing us through jesus to connect with you and it's so simple it requires nothing but the faith of a child and god we come before you freely and openly thank you for being a supernatural god thank you for being a good father for meeting us in our moments of desperation and despair god when everything else seems to be falling through the cracks when there is chaos when there is ambiguity when there is rejection and pain and loss you show up in the most difficult circumstances and god you promise that when you're there anything is possible anything is possible it's never the end when you show up so we do invite you god into every circumstance i pray for my brothers and my sisters who are listening right now perhaps many of them are facing impossible situations opposition rejection loss pain and perhaps there are people who are mourning perhaps there are people who are alone they are incredibly lonely god would you show up in each and every god we circumstance [Music] that you are the god of the underdogs we believe that when everything is stacked against us that all we have to do is call on you and you will show up and bring healing and restoration and bring power power from heaven and that's what we need today god we thank you today for meeting us in jesus name we pray amen [Music] foreign well thank you so much for joining me today please join me tomorrow and make sure you connect and let's agree that god is going to do the impossible we'll see you tomorrow", "all right good morning everyone morning on your way in today you should have received a couple of these cards uh they're just invite cards for you to invite somebody to church next Sunday or really Any Sunday but next Sunday in particular is back to church Sunday it's just really a kickoff uh for the church calendar so make sure you're here next Sunday and uh bring somebody uh with you to church so we have a very special guest here today Pastor Joshua is here today so for those of you that don't know who Pastor Joshua is he was our longtime associate executive Pastor here at the church for 17 or 18 years uh then uh we kicked him out out to uh uh to Missouri and uh we've asked him to come back and speak today for those of you that really don't know um he really is not just an associate pastor for a long time but really A friend of East Coast International Church and uh without him for of the two decades that he was with us we really wouldn't exist today and so he's very much part of our DNA as a church so why don't you welcome Pastor Josh one more time as he comes up today it is an incredible Joy honor and Delight to be uh back with you guys for those of you I know um and to be worshiping with all of you this morning uh I am so excited to be here am you know it was just a little over three years ago that all of our belongings were packed in a yellow Pensky truck that was driving away I stood in my house in West Lyn and listened to the thud of the closing door of one of the bedrooms as it echoed through the empty house we were leaving the house we had lived in for 10 years the city we lived in for 17 to moveed to Missouri the car was packed my wife and I in the front my son and daughter and Cat in the back and my panting English Setter completely taking over the trunk and off we went on a 24 hour drive halfway across the country we were headed to a place we knew very very little about my son and I actually hadn't even seen the house we had bought yet because only my wife and daughter had flown out on the day that uh we needed to sign papers we were going to a place not only with a new house but with a new community amen new schools new friends a new church new jobs new everything and what was going to happen we had taken this giant risk and we had no idea perhaps you can relate to this as an individual maybe there's a piece of your life that is new or you're on a journey uh in some particular part of what's going on in your life some of you I know are new or newer to church or to this church some of you that I've known for many years as we talk about your lives just a little bit in the last few days you are clearly in a new phase of Life yes I know that as a church Community you can relate to this experience of something new happening there are new faces and an incredible new excitement here at East Coast International Church there are new projects and new facilities and let's be honest anytime you see scaffolding outside the church that is a sign of the work of godar clearly something exciting is happening here well there was this moment in the Bible story when Jesus followers were on the verge of a brand new experience in their lives you see Jesus was about to leave them he had died and risen from the dead yes and he was about to ascend to heaven his followers were entering this brand new phase of life when they would take over responsibility for the good news the new thing that Jesus had been doing on Earth on and they had questions in the midst of all of that Jesus has this amazing thing to say to them he said but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere yes in Jerusalem throughout Judea in Samaria and to the ends of the Earth this verse suggests that God was going to do something new that there was news that needed to be shared about this new thing with the whole world but God wasn't going to do a new thing for his followers he was going to do a new thing through his followers God would be personally present with them giving his Spirit to them to help them have everything that they needed to do this work yes that is what it means that they would have the power of the Holy Spirit but in practice itical terms have you ever wondered what that means what does it mean to have the Holy Spirit in my life to be owered by the Holy Spirit what does that really look likeall Lord the book of Acts in the Bible is sort of an answer for this question after Jesus makes this promise it tells all the stories of what happened next and so what we're going to look at today is a couple of the stories about what it looked like to have the people of God empowered by the holy spirit because it didn't look the way I would have expected oh no and maybe it doesn't look the way you might have expected before we jump into this though I want you to think about your life what would it look like for you knew to let God help you do something new in and through your life right here right now today I I want to get really specific though I want you to imagine a specific part of what is going on in your life maybe it seems like it's a place where something is already happening or maybe it's a place where if you're familiar with Jesus you just know you desperately want him to do something new or if you're not particularly familiar with Jesus maybe all you know is this is not working and I need something throughout everything we're going to at today I want you to keep that specific scenario in mind because I want to suggest that as we read through the book of Acts we are going to see the holy spirit's help generally consisting of at least three things first of all God sharing his spirit with us gives us courage but here's what courage looks like sometimes times courage is the power of the Holy Spirit enabling us to ask what's the Worst That Could Happen see sometimes I feel like as followers of Jesus we're not supposed to ask that like we're like somehow the religious spiritual thing to do is to expect everything to just go well all the time and I am so grateful that that is not the story The Bible Tells amen at any point yes this is the story uh we're going to read in just a moment of uh Saul sometimes he's called Saul sometimes he's called Paul uh but we're going to read a little bit of of Saul's story this is the first time Saul ever gets up to preach this is a big moment and so here's what happened Saul's preaching became more and more powerful and the Jews in Damascus couldn't refute his proofs that Jesus was indeed the Messiah yeah man that sounds good right like if the story stopped there we could all clap and go home and then this happens after a while some of the Jews plotted to kill him wh they were watching him day and night at The City Gate so that they could murder him but Saul was told about their plot so during the night some of the other believers lowered him in a large basket through an opening in the city wall all right so the city is protected by this giant wall and he couldn't go through the gates because they were watching for him so literally they pack him up and like a hamper and like lower him down over the wall this does not seem like the way to leave your first great preaching engagement I wonder was this a faith shattering experience for Paul or a faith shaping experience because after all what might Paul have thought he might have thought wow God really just failed or he might have thought wow I really just failed he might have thought that that didn't work we got to try something else might have thought man this is hopeless and this is the moment you expect it to get good right and it does not Paul at this moment flees to Jerusalem where the largest group of Believers is in the world at that moment he runs to them hoping presumably for some safety but they've heard his story and his story if you didn't know is that he spent his entire life up to his conversion moment kill killing Christians that's the part of the story that they've heard and so when he comes for help they're like nope we're all set thank you his past had caught up with him I don't know maybe you can relate to that can anybody relate to the experience of your past catching up to you you are trying to do the right thing you are trying to walk the Hard Road and suddenly who you were makes things harder come on now and if you're honest if there's other people involved just like for Paul there might be a reason they have some questions maybe you were a little complicated at one point now I don't mean you cuz none of you were ever complicated but Paul Paul was complicated all right and in the midst of all of that when his past had caught up with him and tripped him up he kept going and you can see where God was at in the next few words that happens if you were to keep reading the story you see in the midst of all of this when everybody's like not him when he could have thought man maybe I'm not cut out for this suddenly there's these two words but Barnabas and then it tells the rest of the story you see barnabus was one of the followers of Jesus and when everybody else heard about how bad Paul had used to be so did Barnabas but Barnabas thought what's the Worst That Could Happen thought maybe we should take a little bit of a risk here come on now and that risk resulted in helping Man start a career of following Jesus that resulted in dozens of churches all around the known world and half of our new testament all because in the midst of the complicated moment somebody asked what's the worst that could happen and the Bible was able to say but Barnabas did something different amen why is Faith Having the courage to ask what's the worst that could happen because sometimes bad things happen sometimes our past catches up with us Faith knows that being part of this new thing that sharing in this good news of what God is doing doesn't mean that things will necessarily be easy or simple matter of fact I I remember literally like it was yesterday driving home from a Bible study Here In This Very Room with a man who used to be our guitarist his name was Frank and Frank said as we were driving home you know following Jesus sure doesn't make things easier but sure is nice to not be doing it alone Hallelujah Faith asks what's the worst that could happen because it is preparing itself if something bad does happen to declare that that is not the end of the story at the lowest moment in Paul's life his story continues at this low moment in Paul's life God is present and God is at work we saw see all of this in those two words but Barnabas maybe you can relate to having a clear moment when everything is going really great and suddenly you're doing all the right things and it's still falls apart yes help us Lord God brought me to Springfield just a couple of years ago as we started our way out of that driveway where we had lived for 10 years we were on our way to be part of a team to serve at a local church that was brought together literally from the four corners of the country the men and women who were going to serve at this church literally had over A Century of ministry experience doing some very complicated things and all of it was being brought to this little church amen that had a passion for people coming out of addiction and people coming back from prison amen yes Hallelujah as we drove to Springfields we found ourselves asking this very question actually what's the Worst That Could Happen what's the worst that could happen and our answer was well the heart and soul of this church that we're we're coming to serve is based on the pastor's story there amen come on now was an addict and he was miraculously healed and delivered and now he is leading this church what's the Worst That Could Happen what if he relapses amen and just a little over a year later he did and it's so easy in that moment to ask Where's God what's happening and let's be clear God doesn't make people relapse on now and it was not God's will that this man relapse but where was God in the midst of that God was making sure that if something went wrong he had a plan to fix it yes and I've never seen this before but literally the day the wheels fell off the bus at that church there was somebody standing there ready to pick up the pieces somebody who had Decades of experience somebody who is still lead pastoring there today and is an incredible man of God yes Hallelujah because when things got complicated and messy and maybe the worst had happened the story wasn't over and God had something he could and would do through the work of his people and as I've watched this guy lead this church I am constantly amazed because I can't imagine a better person to lead the church through a complicated moment was it chance that he was there at that moment I think not I see the Fingerprints of God in the midst of a sad and painful situation I see proof that the story of the church isn't over that no human failure can make God give up on his purposes amen and that there is no situation we can get into that God can't get out ofall remember that situation I asked you about the situation where you'd like to see something new happen in your life how would your perspective on that situation be impacted if the Holy Spirit empowered you to ask what's the Worst That Could Happen knowing that no situation is ever too messed up for God to work amen that even if the bad thing does happen the story is not over what's the Worst That Could Happen do you dare have the courage to ask that question while still believing that a good God can do a good thing in every situation yes because if you dare that is Faith Hallelujah but Faith doesn't stop there Faith also has the creativity of the Holy Spirit yes the creativity of the spirit empowers us to ask not just what's the worst that could happen but what's the best that could happen in that situation the power of God invites us to create with him by dreaming about what could be check out this other story from the life of Paul just a little while later just a few months later Paul is traveling around trying to start churches and as he's traveling he goes through a city called Antioch another city called Iconium both places they kick him out and so he ends up in a little city called lisra and there he begins to preach again it's like all right something good is g to happen right this is how the story goes then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds to their side they stoned Paul and dragged him out of town thinking he was dead but as the Believers gathered around him he got up went back into the town and the next day he left with Barnabas for Derby right again it would be so easy to think that this was failure help us but imagine if Paul had thought as he was going through all of those complicated situations what's the best that could happen here because if you are actively working and allowing God to actively create through you incredible things can happen yes am in the end it doesn't seem like much had happened but was it worth it Paul's Faith had certainly prepared him for these kind of hard moments he knew how to ask what's the worst that could happen but he' also learned another question he knew how to ask what's the best that could happen and this inspired him to believe that his actions could have a genuine and lasting impact so are you ready for the rest of the story yes yeah not long after this Paul returns to lisra and you know what he finds he finds a thriving community of Believers that has grown up as a result of the work he had done there and in that thriving community that he started he finds a young man named Timothy who for the rest of his life will be one of his most cared for companions one of the men he devotes the most into and who loves him most deeply amen we actually have two letters in the Bible that are correspondents from Paul to this young man Timothy teaching how to be a leader for Jesus Hallelujah what's the best that could happen that sounds pretty good to me a thriving Community that's following Jesus a young man ready to take up the mantle and be mentored by Paul for the rest of his life and a little piece of the Bible that's the best that could happen when Paul thought things were going badly creativity asks what's the best that could happen both believing that God will create with us and through us we stepped out of the church that we were serving at in Springfield just before things got really complicated honestly it had been mounting for about a year and we knew it was time to leave and it was a pretty complicated moment for us and honestly I I had no idea what I was going to do I'd been an associate pastor for 20 years and besides my family there may be nothing on this Earth I love more than being in that second chair and serving local churches Hallelujah but during that time I found myself coming back to a thought I'd had dozens of times over the years what if I found a way to help other associate pastors be awesome what if I created resources after 20 years of doing this to support other people who are in the same kind of a role yes amen got to be honest I am not somebody who starts things I am not an entrepreneur if you picked out 200 words that described me entrepreneur would not be one of them but as I began to embrace this dream one of the things that helped is asking this question what's the best that could happen Hallelujah it helps me dream it helps me hope it energizes me and as you are opening yourself to the ways in which the Holy Spirit wants to work through you to bring the good news in unique ways to various parts of your life I am confident that it can do the same thing for you again remember that situation I asked you to fix in your mind how would your perspective on that situation be impacted if the Holy Spirit empowered you to ask what's the best that could happen what would you long for What would you be able to believe for what would you start working towards if the Holy Spirit were to empower you creatively to work with him in the midst of that situation but let's look now at this third gift of God's spirit because honestly I think it's the one that brings both courage and creativity together and that is the gift of curiosity see the Holy Spirit empowers us to ask what's the worst that could happen and what's the best that could happen but I think the power of the Holy Spirit empowers us to believe that anything could happen you see I sometimes I think we think that having faith means we believe a specific thing is going to happen we are confident that God is going to work in this situation and the outcome is going to look exactly like this this imp picture in our minds but I want to suggest that isn't necessarily what faith is Faith doesn't necessarily think something is going to happen Faith thinks anything could [Music] happen again I love this third moment in Paul's life tells about a sudden left turn Paul takes in his ministry it says that particular night Paul had a vision a man from Macedonia in northern Greece was standing there pleading with him come over to Macedonia and help us so we decided to leave we is Paul and his his team decided to leave for Macedonia at once having concluded that God was calling us to preach the good news there you know creativity is a messy process it sometimes it involves trying a whole lot of things that don't work this was certainly true of Paul he tried to go to Asia and the Holy Spirit stopped him he tried to go to this other place called bethenia and the Holy Spirit stopped him I have no idea what that looked like but what I do know is that Paul made a whole bunch of plans those plans did not work out the way that he wanted them to and somewhere between his plans those plans failing and God showing up he ended up in the right place that is exciting [Music] Hall I can relate to this the worship team can come on up I got to be honest I wish I had had a dream like that in a the moment when I was on the verge of making a decision wouldn't that like be awesome like why are you doing whatever you're doing cuz I had a dream and God told me to am that that did not happen to me but I have spent this last year developing coaching and training resources for associate pastors I never thought I'd be a person who started his own thing or worked for himself and I have no idea where this journey is going and I'll be honest I have a lot of questions on now some of them are anxious questions like is this going to work some of them are just confused questions like I'm seriously like how can this work am some of them are a little bit more practical and a little bit more frustrated like why on Earth won't he call me [Music] back but I also have the questions that I've learned from Faith Hallelujah what's the Worst That Could Happen what's the best that could happen yes putting all of this together I I realize that I don't have to know what is going to happen amen having faith isn't knowing the outcome it isn't believing that this thing or that thing is going to happen it is believing that if I am faithful to Jesus Anything Could Happen [Music] Hallelujah and so I'm confident of this it is going to be better than I imagined yes it is but it is going to be a lot different than I expected yes Hallelujah so I want you you to remember that situation I asked you about how would your perspective on that situation be impacted if the Holy Spirit empowered you to believe that anything could happen yes if you had the courage to ask what's the worst that could happen and still be confident that it's not the end of the story if you had the creativity to ask what's the best that could happen and if you had the Curiosity the openness to believe that anything could happen any moment God could be on the verge of doing something miraculous yes and your next action might just be the Catalyst for that Miracle Hallelujah you'd stand with me you might be thinking yes I want that courage you might be thinking yes I want that [Music] creativity you might be thinking yes I want that Curiosity or maybe you're thinking yeah that situation you talked about I don't know what I want but I want God to show up or maybe like I I said at the beginning you're not super familiar with God and so all you're really thinking is like you said yeah I just need something different amen wherever you're at with that in just a moment we're going to start singing a song and as we start to sing I would invite you to come forward we're going to make this front part of the room we're just going to set it upside and make it a special place where you can have a conversation with God about what's going on in your life you can come forward and and you can kneel down or you can come forward and just stand and raise your hands and as you're standing here you might feel someone rest their hand on your shoulder know that they are doing that in support of you because as you are trying to figure out what to say with to God they are praying with you and if you are not sure what to say when you get up here all you have to do to start the conversation is Jesus let's do this together and then say whatever comes naturally after that so again as we sing this song Together As We Set This Moment aside to be a special moment with God I would invite you to come forward and have that conversation and see what God can do", "[Music] all right thank you for joining us today online in revere and here lynn as well tomorrow afternoon a group of six of us from the church will be joining 17 other people from two other churches and we'll fly out to israel to go make sure that the places that we read about in the bible are actually there we are going to stand where elijah called down fire from heaven we are going to touch the tomb of king david we are going to pay at pray at the western wall of the old temple we're going to check out nehemiah's wall we are going to climb down underneath the church that is built on top of the cave where jesus was born we will walk through nazareth the hometown of jesus and stand where the people that knew him his whole life tried to throw him off of a cliff we will stand on the shores of the sea of galilee where jesus called his first disciples we will literally stand where jesus stood and walk where jesus walked and we will see where he was crucified and where he was buried and rose from the dead and we will set sail on a boat out onto the sea where jesus walked on water and often sailed around doing super cool stuff that sea is called the sea of galilee you see it on the map the jordan river flows down the water comes from the mountains around turns into the jordan river eventually the jordan river goes into the sea of galilee which you see at the top of the map the sea of galilee then continues and eventually goes down to a sea called the dead sea it's a fascinating contradiction to have the sea of galilee and the dead sea the sea of galilee is filled with life and provides the region with with bounty all around but just a few miles to the south the dead sea has nothing it's dead why is the dead sea called the dead sea because nothing lives in it because it collects water but it doesn't give any out the water stops at the dead sea it's the lowest place on earth and it has no life to give it's stagnant and salty because water comes in but it doesn't go out it hoards all the water and gives nothing in return so listen friends the next time we have a trip to israel feel free to join us but second be like the sea of galilee that is teeming in life and health and providing a bounty to those around and don't be like the dead sea that hoards the water and doesn't give life and that just sets us up for our third and final week in our faith and finances series at the intersection of faith and finances this is week three so far we've covered what's your attitude towards money we've encouraged you to get to a place of financial honesty we have discovered the important part that being a disciple of jesus the place that good stewardship has in being a disciple of jesus the dangers of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the importance of using the blessing of one season to prepare for the hardship of another it's important the importance of coming to your senses if you are in a bad situation i don't know why that one's so hard the coming to your senses part but if you need to change your employer or change your skill set or change your career that's all right and above all else return to the father so that's just a recap of the last two weeks if you want to be a wildly generous person this sermon might be for you and we're going to talk about some financial principles today listen i have no desire to twist your arm if you don't want to be generous i'm not going to twist your arm at all my honest harsh desire is to assist you in being the best possible disciple of jesus in the area of stewardship and i would strongly encourage you to listen to this text second corinthians chapter nine remember this whoever sows sparingly will reap sparingly so if you don't want to reap bigly don't sow bigly i don't think that's a word whoever sows generously will also reap generously each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give listen to that what you decided in your heart to give don't let me twist your arm not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver and god is able to bless you abundantly so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work as it is written they have freely scattered gifts to the poor their righteousness endures forever now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness you will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to god today i want you to let that passage sink in god does not want you to give reluctantly if you are reluctant to give he doesn't want it he does want does not want you to give because you are having your arm twisted or your emotions tugged at and pulled he wants you to give because of the second part because you understand god's ability to bless you abundantly because you understand that god is the ultimate source of all good things he is the one that provides the seed it's that understanding that our source is god not ourselves there's a lesson that i teach to college students preparing for ministry and the one of the first lessons is everything you think is wrong and i'm not kidding because we get it all twisted up in our head in our mind we think that we understand and know the truth all of it comes from god it's all god generosity is about trust and leadership you're not generous because you're stingy you're generous because you trust in a good god you're generous because you understand his leadership generosity does something also generosity breaks the curse of greed in your life generosity breaks the curse of generational poverty for generations down line from you generosity positions the kingdom to be seen as a city on a hill for those that are trapped in darkness so let's get this generosity thing dealt with see i believe the vast majority of you today listening want to be generous and you would love to grow in that area you'd be like i would like to be more generous this year than i was last year i think that is the reality for the vast majority of us i don't really come across people that say i wish i was not so generous people at the end of their life that i'm sitting with don't say ah i was way too generous i've never heard that set a few years ago i was invited to do to join the regional board of a christian non-profit financial organization called thrivan i believe that they are the only non-profit on the fortune 500. one of my roles on that board on the the regional board is to help strategize around the giving away of watch this several hundred million dollars a year not several hundred dollars several hundred million dollars a year that they give away one of those places that money is put into is funding of a free financial planning organization called money canvas i talked to you about it last week moneycanvas.com i would encourage you if you do not currently have a budget or a spending plan or really if you don't know anything about money i would strongly encourage you to go to moneycanvas.com maybe even while i'm preaching and schedule an appointment a virtual appointment it's 100 free you will not be sold anything it is a gift i would strongly encourage you to go there and get a free financial coach lots of money is uh in this thriving that we give lots of the money is given to housing organizations uh ministries churches food pantries refugee programs animal shelters re-entry programs and there's literally thousands of things that money is given to and i could go on and on hundreds of millions of dollars every single year being distributed create to create as much social change and impact as possible so while you all pull out your phone please pull out your phone right now here's your job on the screen right now i want you to text this number pastor jesse is already married so don't send him any love notes or valentines all right so this is justin i need you to help me i want to give away a hundred million dollars or at least influence how it's directed i wanted to do as much good as possible to advance the kingdom of god what should we do with it for real text this number and tell tell us what to do with a hundred million dollars that would create as much kingdom of god advancement as possible and create societal change and impact let's just take a minute to do that i'm going to tell you something it's hard to give a hundred million dollars away it doesn't sound like it is so for the last few years when i go out to these meetings i'll catch a an uber from the uh from the airport to a meeting and inevitably that the uber driver will say what are you out here for i'll tell them what i'm doing and they said we give a lot of money away to a lot of nonprofits and he'd say can i have some every uber driver ever is said to say can i have some of it i said actually i can't even have some of it so uh we we don't so it's interesting how people's minds work on that so if you just put your name down maybe come up with another idea is the point is the point on that but again so as you're texting it i want you to think about this how does it make you feel if i said we're going to do every single thing you just said how would it make you feel to be like wow i helped give this organization fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars you feel pretty good about it it feels pretty good to give some money away to people that need it so when you are in a position to give away somebody else's money to benefit people and good organizations it's kind of a rush you're like you're not thinking about how to save as much money as possible you're like oh you can you have a million you have a million it's like oprah right you know you're just giving away money just giving away money and if i'm really really honest it's easy to give away other people's money because the stuff belongs to somebody else so i'm setting you up right now let's reflect on this idea as we cultivate a generous spirit in a pointed and somewhat aggressive conversation that god was having with a man named job a wicked long time ago god says this job chapter 41 verse 11 who has first given to me that i should repay him whatever is under the whole heaven is mine it's god talking in other words all the stuff belongs to god all the trees all the rivers all the gold all the silver all the land it ultimately belongs to god deuteronomy 10. and now israel what does the lord your god require of you he requires only that you fear the lord your god and live in a way that pleases him and love him and serve him with all your heart and soul and you must always obey the lord's commands and decrees that i am giving you today for your own good tell your neighbor for your own good see all the stuff all the things that you think of is restrictive our rules are really there as gifts as jenner from a generous god for your own good look the highest heavens on the earth and everything in it all belong to the lord your god yet the lord chose your ancestors as the objects of his love and he chose you their descendants above all other nations as is evident today therefore change your hearts and stop being stubborn why don't you tell your neighbors stop being stubborn also that's a good one so you stop being stubborn so right there in the middle of this very generous passage there's a call to a loving relationship with god and a call to a heart check to stop being stubborn and here we see the idea squished in the middle once again that the earth and everything in it all somebody say all all belong to god so we we have this thing that we say sometimes at the end of prayers or expressions all the glory and all the honor and all the power belong to you we should also add and all the stuff belongs to you in haggai chapter 2 for this is what the lord of heaven's armies says in just a little while i will again shake the heavens and the earth the oceans and the dry land i will shake all the nations and the treasures of the nations will be brought to this temple i will fill this place with glory says the lord of heaven's armies the silver is mine and the gold is mine says the lord of heaven's armies the future glory of this temple will be greater than its past glory says the lord of heaven's armies and in this place i will bring peace the lord of heaven's armies has spoken what's going on here god's making this eternal and universal declaration that all the things all the things ultimately belong to god all of the silver and all of the gold it belongs to god all of the things what belongs to god all the things there's no things that don't belong to god and just to make sure that the people doing their dishes watching online today have heard this as well psalm chapter 50 verse 7. o my people listen as i speak here are my charges against you o israel i am god your god i have no pla complaint against your sacrifices or the burnt offerings that you constantly offer but i do not need the bulls and your barns or the goats from your pens for all the animals of the forest are mine and i own the cattle on a thousand hills i know every bird on the mountains all the animals of the field are mine if i were hungry i would not tell you for all the world is mine and everything in it do i eat the meat of bulls do i drink the blood of goats make thankfulness your sacrifice to god and keep your vows you made to the most high then call on me when you are in trouble and i will rescue you and you will give me glory verse 11 all the animals what is the lesson what's what what's what am i driving towards here as we're thinking about being good stewards and generous we must first recognize that none of the things are your things none of the stuff is your stuff even my clothes are not my clothes it's not my stuff it's god's stuff so let me challenge you with this examine every dollar you have and find out what it's doing every single dollar that you have should have a job and here's why because it's not really your dollar it's god's dollar and god has simply entrusted it to us god has entrusted a resource to you and i to do his work with it and so when you start to put a name to the dollar and an assignment to the dollar it helps you and i to understand if we are being good stewards a trustee are we wasting the money are we flushing the money or are we in fact investing it correctly into the kingdom and making the greatest impact it can make does that mean that i can't take care of my family no no no you're supposed to take care of your family with that's part of it so yes you should get an education yes transportation yes vacation yes give presents to people yes absolutely purchase a fourth vacation home that sits empty most of the year probably not okay so there is a place where it moves from honoring god to dishonoring god we have to to make sure that we're always in the honoring space so what we're trying to do is help remove obstacles that are in the way of giving you uh we're trying to give you obstacles that tools that will remove obstacles to help you take next steps there's an app if you're just one of these app people and you just need an app for everything it's called every dollar there's a free version and a paid version you can use the free version uh to help you with some budgeting set for your life first do the moneycanvas.com thing and then then do that let me talk to you about the tool of intentionality today first corinthians 16. as we're thinking about intentionality as we're thinking about how to be generous i you don't accidentally become a generous person you do it on purpose it says in verse verse 2 of chapter 16. on the first day of each week you should put aside each put aside a portion of the money you have earned don't wait until i get there and then try to collect it all at once this passage is in a much bigger context but this is a bible verse where money and intentionality intersect we have to be intentional with the important things in our life if you want to be generous you must be intentional i i made a a huge error in my life last year in the area of intentionality see one of the things i love doing is going on vacation with my family i don't love going to the beach but i love going on vacation i love i like to go on an adventure explore new places eat new foods find creative restaurants hike new trails learn new things hearing different stories creating new memories getting just a fresh perspective and after 28 years of doing this my wife and i we for 28 years or for much of the 28 years we have two big vacations pinned in our in our annual schedule it used to be we'd go away every may and every october every may every october every may every october for years we did this then after 28 years of this refreshing rhythm and figuring out our rhythms the pandemic and we like the rest of the world went into a different mode on the family side of things there was a silver lining but on the church side of things we went into a full-scale sprint running as fast as we could to try and get everything stable and secure so that when the pandemic was over we would still be able to gather so we would sprint to get the service online we would sprint to have daily zoom gatherings bible studies check-ins communications then we realized we really had to up our game on all the stuff because it really wasn't very good and so we started sprinting to fix and add and improve and create and the staff and the volunteers that hung in with us through this it really was a sacrificial act of love for our church for our cities and for each other and i absolutely thank you and honor you for the work that you did over the last two years one day after about a year of the pandemic i woke up ready to go to tackle the next challenge and i thought wow i'm tired i'm really amped up and ready to go but i'm physically exhausted so i checked my vitals my rhythms my jesus time okay good jack my sabbath time doing all right check yeah my weekly date night check good weird but good you know dates in parking lots picking up food and eating it's just strange my vacation time oh we forgot to take our vacation for over a year just kind of forgot we'd fallen into the trap like so many people of thinking that the pandemic was a sprint when it really has been a marathon or two or three of them and for the first time in 28 years we've accidentally deleted one of our family's most important healthy rhythms and most important times to maintain at one of the most important times that we should have been maintaining them so we quickly adjusted made plans but in order to adjust and make a plan you have to be intentional there was an intentionality about it and that my friends is the point it takes intentionality to do the healthiest things in your life it takes intentionality to eat healthy food you don't even have to read the bible for that one that you just know that's true i have never gone to a store ever in my life and accidentally bought a vegetable but i have gone to a store and accidentally purchased six boxes of little debbie christmas tree snack cakes that that might have happened once it uh it takes intentionality if you want to go to college to actually go to college it takes intentionality to climb mount everest it takes intentionality to be kind to your enemies it takes intentionality to forgive to forgive those that have harmed or offended you you don't accidentally forgive people you do that on purpose it takes intentionality to be wise with money it takes intentionality to create a lifestyle of generosity so let's think about that for a moment when it comes to generosity what are the things you need to be intentional about things that you can measure and see if you're actually cultivating a generous spirit you know at the end of every year we email you a copy of a stewardship report or your gifts for the year i don't read those and then send them out we just send them out it's automatic why it's an opportunity for you to check how you did am i making progress in this area am i doing what i set out to do it's like we need to have a google fit for our soul like if you have an android phone you have this google fit thing on there and if you set it up it'll give you heart points and how many steps you did and daily goals and weekly targets and energy expended and so you get to the end of the day and you'd be like man i had a really good day i really moved and you look at your google fit and it turns out you were a slug that day and uh and so you kind of kind of assess how you actually did compared to how you thought you did and so the question is what generosity steps are you taking so that takes us back to the past we just read first corinthians 16. on the first day i want you to check how there's things to measure here on the first day of each week that's sunday you should each put aside a portion of the money you earned don't wait until i get there and then try to collect it all at once so there's a when a what and aware the when is on the first day of the week what you give or you're generous with the money based on a portion of what you earn so if you make a lot you give a lot if you make it little you give a little where is in the collection in our context today that would be church in other words don't show up and decide decide then show up that's that's the challenge you decide and then you do and then once you decide do not be afraid to challenge yourself to grow in the area of generosity why because earlier we understand if you so much you reap much it's okay because we trust that we can trust god an abundant god it's okay to to put that to the test make a plan figure out how to follow through as the worship team comes up figure out how to follow through with that plan and then execute on that plan now as you're doing this what's going to happen whenever you start to do a budget whenever you start to be intentional about your finances whenever you decide that you're you're not just going to live in survival mode anymore and you're going to start to make progress when you make these decisions this was going to surface many obstacles that are in your way that's okay the obstacles are there it's not like oh i got an obstacle i can't do this anymore everybody has obstacles it's going to surface the obstacles so that you can begin to address those obstacles one issue at a time you don't have to tackle them all at once just one issue at a time and so over the last three weeks counting this week we've given you kind of this baseline to work from we've given you some tools we'll put some stuff out on social media this week as well just to remind you of where to go to get some of these these resources but we will not make any progress you will not make any progress in your life on this issue by letting it happen you will have to make it happen and you make it happen with intentionality so this week it's okay to spend some time on this we set the tone for many years now that money talk is spiritual talk it's okay you're allowed to talk about these things and see it through a spiritual lens what does god want you to do how does god want you to to respond how does god want you to be generous and in what areas of your life lots of lots of things to cover lots of things to cover if you need help with this feel free to reach out again moneycanvas.com every dollar and of course the bible is always there as well to help give you clear direction on how to use your finances that god entrusts to you why don't you stand with me as we close today i've noticed in 30 plus years of pastoral ministry that there's three times three times or three themes that it's a little bit complicated [Music] for people to to respond to what the scripture says anything in the area of sex and sexuality is complicated for people [Music] anything in the area of mental health is complicated and anything in the area of finances is complicated the bible has a lot to say about all of these things the bible doesn't come at it at you to like condemn you or to beat you jesus didn't come to condemn you he came to set you free not to judge you give you a hope and a future this is just one of those things it's not the only thing but it is something that is worth submitting to the lordship of jesus in your life let him lead you in this area and if there are other areas in your life today that you need to invite jesus into to lead your life do it today do it today the worship team is going to lead us in this last song if you'd like to spend some time at the altar pray please do so [Music] join us for hope week taking place tuesday february 22nd through saturday february 26 from 12 to 3 p.m each day at our revere location we're going to love on the kids in our community by providing them a fun place to have meals play games and learn something about jesus each day this event is just around the corner and we need your help for us to serve our revere community there are many ways that you and your family can get involved sign up on the church center app to provide one of our meals serve as one of our amazing volunteers or request more information about what hope week is all about", "well good morning again everybody I want to say congratulations to all of those who were baptized this last Sunday evening we got a couple of pictures that are firing up on the screen so just just roll them right through roll them right through there we go that's pictures of their back of their heads this is interesting okay all right so uh it's great to great to have uh them join us uh there so that was unusual because we weren't in the ocean but again it apparently was dangerous to be in the ocean so we didn't want to mess with that another big thing happened this week it was the 18-year Milestone anniversary of our daughter Church in Granada Nicaragua we got some pictures up here on the screen as well from our celebration Service uh this past this past weekend and so there's a handful of you that have been there uh with us in the past that's Pastor Carlos for those of you that uh remember and this has just been a tremendous uh season of growth for them so we're very excited for this church in Granada Nicaragua so when we talk about world missions or World Outreach Partners the money that you give specifically designated for this we just send all of that to our missionaries okay we send it all to our World Outreach partners and so this moment when we talk about that once a month uh it's just a reminder for you if you'd like to give something extra please do it's always in our church Center app as an option for you to give to that anytime that you like in two weeks we have the Justice Conference and we've been asked a few questions and I just want to bring some clarification for you what is the Justice Conference it is a conference that we have established last year was our first one but it is very intentionally designed to help us think through carefully as a church our role in biblical Justice that includes racial Justice it includes how to bring flourishing to our community thinking in terms of like Community Development and things like that so Shannon Polk is a reverend she's a doctor and she's a lawyer okay so uh and she she's coming to us to help us work through this together and so that will be on we'll she'll preach on Sunday but on Saturday before there is an all-day conference and you can sign up in the church Center app for that and it would be helpful for us to know how many of you are going to be able to come to that and if you could please come to that this is extremely important for us as a church in a multicultural multi-ethnic church that is growing in this area year over year it is critical that we understand this and it is critical that we understand this in our city it is also critical that we understand this as followers of Jesus simply as followers of Jesus if if the heartbeat of Jesus is Justice then it needs to be our heartbeat as well and this is to help us move that forward jumping into our message today as we're beginning this series continuing the series on the book of Acts I want to go back to a moment when Jesus prayed for you Jesus prayed for you back in John chapter 17. Jesus prayed for you and he said this now I'm coming to you I told you told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy I have given them your word and the world hates them because they do not belong to the world just as I do not belong to the world I'm not asking you to take them out of the world but to keep them safe from the evil one this is Jesus praying for you they do not belong to this world any more than I do make them Holy by your truth teach them your word which is truth just as you sent me into the world I am sending them into the world it's always a interesting and profound reminder to remember that Jesus prayed for us he prayed for us in advance he prayed for us knowing what we would face if Jesus is sending us into the world but we are not supposed to belong to the world how do we do that if if we're supposed to be in the world but not of the world that seems a little bit complicated how do you actually follow Jesus in the real world how do you live for Jesus in the real world how do you interact and engage with the world around you that is so complicated and broken and beat up and the answer to this can be found in part in the pages of the book of Acts which tells us the accounts of how the early Disciples of Jesus did this so we have examples in print of how people did what Jesus prayed for us to do now some of them did it really well and some of them did it pretty horrible um and we learn from both sides of it we learned okay let's not do that and let's do that instead it's like our spiritual map and uh there is something in our American culture that we have a bit of an attitude where we prefer to learn lessons on our own like somehow we are we take pride that we like grew up in the School of Hard Knocks or graduated from the School of Hard Knocks there's no pride in that friends like that's not great it's much better for us to learn from other people's mistakes than from our own right we don't have to if we I mean if you make a mistake learn from it but you know you can learn from somebody else's mistakes so you don't have to make the same mistake and so the book of Acts gives us both mistakes and victories that we can follow and and learn from so we're continuing we start with Acts chapter 1 verse 6. so when the apostles were with Jesus they kept asking him Lord has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom whose kingdom are they trying to restore our somebody say hour hour we'll get back to that he replied the father alone has the authority to set those dates and times that they are not for you to know but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem throughout Judea Samaria and to the ends of the Earth after saying this he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching and they could no longer see him as they strained to see him Rising into heaven two white robed men suddenly stood among them men of Galilee they said why are you standing here staring into heaven Jesus has been taken from you into heaven but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go all right there is so much going on here Pastor David read a little bit of this last week we won't we won't do the same thing that he did but pay very close attention to this in verse 6. when the apostles were with Jesus the apostles these are now moved from disciples to Apostles by the way so these are the leaders of the church these are the most holy people on the planet at the time okay in theory so when the apostles were with Jesus they kept asking him Lord has the time come for you to free Israel and restore Our Kingdom this might not seem like a big deal it might not seem like like it's a place to pause but it's exceptionally important you need to get this Jesus has now wrapped up his Earthly Ministry he's already been unjustly executed on a cross he's been buried he's now raised from the dead leaving an empty tomb now he shows up amongst the now Apostles leaders of the church and what do these spiritual Giants want to know from Jesus is when do we get to win the election when do we get to be in charge politically do I get to be the president now that's what they want to know the apostles still think after the last three and a half years they still think this is about political power they want to replace one Empire the Roman Empire with their preferred Empire them not the kingdom of God which Jesus has spent three and a half years talking about helping them to see but the kingdom of political Israel they want to overthrow Rome with now these guys are Knuckleheads obviously but Christians have been Knuckleheads on this issue for the last 2000 years we experience this today in the United States of America over the next year people across this nation are going to lose their minds as we head into a presidential election season she's going to lose their minds based on whoever their preferred candidate or party is it would be very wise if you want to really follow Jesus to learn the lesson that Jesus teaches here throughout his ministry and to these Apostles that they were so slow to learn that the Earthly Empires that we live within are amongst are not the point at all our Allegiance is never to an Earthly Empire our Allegiance is exclusively to the kingdom of God [Applause] the whole scene is very familiar if you're familiar with the Bible this is not the first time this kind of dialogue has happened it's very familiar to a situation that happened a thousand plus years earlier see all the nations of the region had Kings and so the nation of Israel which did not have a king wanted a king because all the other political systems had Kings and they wanted to be like other people watch how it plays out it goes back to First Samuel chapter eight Samuel was a prophet he was the prophet of God he was the voice of God to the people he was their in-person leader to help Shepherd the people of God so God was their King God was their leader and Samuel just helped them to understand what God was saying he served God and he served the people well so that was the setup that God wanted first Samuel chapter 8 Samuel grew old he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel Joel and abijah his oldest Sons held Court in Beersheba but they were not like their father for they were greedy for money they accepted bribes and perverted Justice finally all the Elders of Israel met at Rama to discuss the matter with Samuel look they told him you are now old and your sons are not like you give us a king to judge us like all the other nations have so they're trying to step in in a place where God clearly would have taken care of it Samuel was displeased with their requests and went to the Lord for guidance This Is What God Says do everything they say to you the Lord replied for they are not rejecting me they are rejecting me not you for they are rejecting me not you really some of the scariest words in the Bible and some of the scariest words of the Bible are about their misunderstanding of the role in the world God is to be their King God is to be our King they don't want me to be their King any longer ever since I brought them from Egypt they have continually abandoned me and followed other gods and now they are giving you the same treatment do as they ask but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them now there's a few things here they are rejecting God by choosing an Earthly leader to lead them instead of Allowing God to lead them that does not mean that the king is a bad guy don't misunderstand this that does not mean that the king is a bad guy it's just that he isn't God didn't want that for his people God had a special place for his people where he would be their King they would be his people and they would right off into the sunset together no no they would just have a great time together God didn't want this Earthly system for his people but he did something interesting he accommodated their request somebody say accommodated so it's an interesting idea the principle of God accommodating and people that understand incorrectly is an interesting theological reality in Scripture God will often accommodate our wrong-headed thinking or cultural assumptions to get us closer to the truth and sometimes we can convince ourselves that God has a because God has accommodated our misunderstanding that it's correct when he's just moving you he's not endorsing your bad behavior he's not endorsing your wrong thinking he's accommodating you to help you move forward so God didn't want his people to have an Earthly King he wanted to be their leader in spite of all this God still uses this situation and if you fast forward a thousand years God uses the situation to eventually Usher in the king of all Kings Jesus Christ so he comes back around so God doesn't give up on his idea he comes back around and now Jesus is King Jesus who is now present in the Acts chapter 1 account the god of the universe is present now amongst the apostles the most holy of Christians and they make the exact same mistake that the people made with Samuel so watch it carefully power shifts in the empires of this world have never ever been the goal it's not the goal living within the kingdom of God has always been the point where the people of God live under the rule and reign of God in the kingdom of God where we would no longer Embrace any empires of this world self-professing Christians have made the same mistake for centuries trying to take over Empires by force or threat or coercion but Jesus here again makes it clear yes you will have power but it's an entirely different kind of power than what you think our primary goal is not to be in positions of power rather our primary goal is to walk with and have the power of the Holy Spirit that's the point that Jesus is making here so last week Pastor David touched on this a bit in Acts 1 8 and so I want you to hear it today though this is Jesus redirecting his his followers saying you're thinking about political power seats and I'm talking about something different acts 1 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the ends of the Earth we're not going to be able to unpack all of that today but the essence of that is that was a a mind-blowing statement that Jesus just made to them he was correcting them and pulling them close all at the same time this is Jesus replying to them as he corrects their misconceptions adjust their perspectives concerning the kingdom of God he declares in this one statement that the kingdom of God is spiritual in character International in its membership and gradual in its expansion all in one simple statement throughout the Book of Acts the distinctive purpose of the outpouring of the holy spirit is to empower the church for Ministry for service for overcoming nothing about political power don't get it confused when we say power we're talking about this kind of power not the kind of power that overthrows the government but the kind of power that loves the unlovable lifts up the Fallen Embraces the Foreigner empowers the Forgotten forgives the guilty redeems the cast aside frees the captive rescues the perishing and cares for the dying pleads for those in error and heals the broken when you hear the word power in the Bible in a positive sense that's what it's talking about it's the power that only the Holy Spirit can give and you cannot get through any political party in order to be a personal witness of Jesus is why we are empowered a personal witness of Jesus not just a witness of the church not just a witness of cool stuff that we do but of the living Jesus who has rescued you and can rescue other people as well so if Jesus says we need to be empowered by the Holy Spirit as one of the very last things that he says to us then we should make it our highest of values to be empowered by the Holy Spirit literally it should be a daily checklist goal be empowered by the Holy Spirit wait be empowered check let's move on with the day we've got to learn to make being empowered by the Holy Spirit a high value in the coming weeks we're going to talk a little more specifically on this about this about the specifics on it but let me lay the foundation for it right now there is a theme that runs throughout much of Acts it is the urgency that all Christians become empowered by the Holy Spirit it was urgent and it was normative Jesus understood it to be essential and the apostles soon understood it to be essential as well it is a critical theme throughout the Book of Acts so when Jesus was praying for us to be in the world but not of the world how we're able to pull that off is to be empowered by the Holy Spirit verse 9 verse 9 continuing after saying this immediately after saying all that Jesus now he's taken up into a cloud not like a rain cloud guys this is like the glory of God okay it's like the Shekinah cloud like a glory of God kind of cloud uh and they could no longer they were watching they could no longer see him as they strained to see him Rising into heaven two white robed men suddenly stood among them men of Galilee they said why are you standing here staring into heaven Jesus has been taken from you into heaven but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go great news here King Jesus is coming back he's coming back he's not he didn't just leave for good he's coming back after a period of time Jesus is coming back after certain things are accomplished Jesus is coming back the King of Kings will return to gather together all who have accepted his invitation into his kingdom to once and for all when Jesus comes back he will once and for all rid the universe of the illegitimate ruler of the world Satan that's good news and to ultimately establish the reign of Jesus forever and ever and ever so that's what that all means Romans chapter 8 the creation looks forward to the day when it will join God's children in glorious freedom from death and Decay what's that mean even the rocks and trees are looking forward to Jesus coming back is what it means that will happen ultimately when the king of all Kings returns once and for all so verse 11. men of Galilee they said the two white robed men probably angels not just random guys walking by men of Galilee they said why are you standing here staring into heaven I can just imagine the angels looking around at the crowd of people that have gathered there looking up going hey everybody let's go let's go it's time to get to work we got lots to do let's go fellas this is going to be epic but you got to get moving you can't just stand here looking up at the sky you get this idea there is in between as the worship team comes up in between the present and the future is the space that we live in today I want you to think about this over here on the side of the stage over here you have this moment where you have the final words of Jesus and he's talking about the promise of the Holy Spirit to be empowered to live within this world and to advance the kingdom of God so you have that moment and then you have this future moment that the Angels talked about you have this future moment over here where Jesus will someday return the king of all Kings will return his kingdom will be full and final it will be amazing all the way over here but we live somewhere in here we live somewhere here in the in between and that's honestly a little bit complicated and if you try to live in the in between following Jesus all by yourself without the empowerment of the Holy Spirit you're going to have a rough time you're not going to get it right because it's too hard and it's too complicated in the book of Acts acts is the beginning of the in-between story that's where it all started it's the beginning of the in between we are now the next step after we're the continuation of the in-between now I look forward to the great and glorious and joyous ending where we get to see Jesus face to face where there's no more chaos no more destruction no more Struggle No More illness no more sickness no more drama no more Facebook it will be a perfect ending of a complicated struggle where Jesus Christ is Victor that's how you're going to know no more social media Jesus Is Back [Laughter] [Music] remember the 2007 football season and the New England Patriots had a perfect beginning and a horrible ending 16 wins regular season zero losses regular season and then it all fell apart from the Super Bowl losing to the Giant 17-14 if you're a football fan that was horrible unless you don't like the Patriots and that was great but sorry some of you just had dramatic moments right there I apologize [Music] I question whether to put that in there the uh [Music] but the whole time you're hoping could it be could be perfect to see all the way through could it be and then it ends badly well [Music] when we're talking about this we don't have to guess How It Ends we know that we win the spiritual Super Bowl we know that we win in the end we know that whatever's happening on the in between that Jesus ultimately wins that's the point of the book Jesus wins our future is secure in that we already know that we have won but there's some work that needs to be done in the in between [Music] so we've got work to do so let's go let's be the people that God created us to be let's set aside foolishness let's serve let's love let's pray let's Rejoice let's build a strong Community let's be a blessing to the neighborhood let's find a need and fill it let's find a hurt and heal it let's bring the name of Jesus Christ the ultimate Victor to all who will receive it let's go that's the point of Acts let's go live in this in between as we set up Jesus final Victory would you stand with me as we close tonight if you missed this today I just want to make sure you didn't Jesus has a kingdom and he wants you in his kingdom and if you didn't know that Jesus wanted you to be part of his kingdom know it today Jesus invites you into his kingdom how do you respond to that very simply you ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins to lead your life what does that look like for us today it's it's saying to Jesus Jesus I want to give you my allegiance I want to give you my life I want to give you my hopes and dreams I want to give you my failures and my shortcomings I just want to give you everything so I could live in your kingdom the way you want me to live for others who have been part of the Kingdom if you've been in this in between Place really struggling not living fully not living abundantly not living with any of the stuff we've been talking about I want you to very seriously and deeply consider [Music] allowing the spirit of God to empower you in a different way inviting the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit I need your empowerment I need your power to live this life victoriously I need your power to do the things that you because I cannot do them on my own Jesus wants us to ask he wants us to be open so that we can have that power the worship team is going to close us with this as they do let's spend some time in prayer today however you want to respond to that the altars are open let's go ahead and begin to prayer", "\n\nIndex\n\n  *

titled you will receive power welcome to day four today our topic is be here now as we get started i want to ask a question what is the biggest challenge you face in your prayer life now today i want us to take a moment and truly be honest be transparent even vulnerable honestly what is the biggest challenge you face in your prayer life like think for a moment of the last time somebody invited you to anything that had to do with prayer where you knew it was a prayer event you knew that prayer was going to take place you knew that someone might even ask you to pray and what was the initial response did you feel excited did you feel like oh man i can't wait or honestly did you feel a little bit anxious did you feel a little bit you know hesitant think for a moment of your reaction that initial response because that might point to an obstacle in your way and you know sometimes i will be on a date with my wife and it'll be the perfect setting the perfect moment and then all of a sudden my wife will turn to me and she'll say hey be here now and what it means is that you know in that moment i'm there but i'm not really there like maybe my body is there but my mind is somewhere else you know because my mind begins to race and and she can tell that my wife can tell that and so if you're anything like me your life is constantly moving at an accelerated rate and in fact you know if you're from the area you know that even when you go through a drive-through you know you're getting that coffee you're getting that service and you expect it to be quick fast just give me my coffee so that i can get on with my life and we do this in many other areas and that's just the type of life that i live sometimes and i need to be aware of that because sometimes i can get ahead of myself sometimes i can put the wagon before the horse has that ever happened to you jesus promises his followers supernatural ability right this is what we've been talking about and you know in the moment right before jesus uh ascended to heaven after he rose from the dead he took a moment and he gave his followers some instructions on what to do now that he was going up to heaven and he told them this in luke 24 49 and now i will send the holy spirit just as my father promised but stay here in the city until the holy spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven it's interesting what jesus says because jesus is gearing them up to go out and change the world and on the other hand he's asking them don't move until you've been empowered wait here he tells them stay here in the city so what's going on there seems to be a conflict between those two ideas but in reality what god is doing is he's setting up a pattern a pattern that they'll need to follow later on in a pattern that we need to get a hold of today and it is this when we meet god in prayer we can step out in power i'll say it again when we meet god in prayer we can step out in power why because it is in prayer that we are empowered this pattern creates a dependency on god so we're not getting ahead of god we're not going out to try to change the world in our own understanding and our own wisdom this is a case where we actually want to be dependent you know we're all about independence you know we're we're very patriotic and we understand the concept and the value of freedom but when it comes to prayer we actually want to develop a dependency on god so in prayer we're able to cultivate an organic relationship where we are learning the rhythms of god as we get to know him more this isn't something that we can simply manufacture it's not something we can rush into and rush out of and check off of our list it requires some patience it requires us to slow down long enough to know him better because when there is intimacy when we get to know god it changes us truly from the inside out and therefore we're able to change the world this is what happens in prayer we receive transformation we get to align ourselves with what god is trying to do on the earth but we have to be present we have to be here now and many times we have to slow down it's a discipline it's something that god is inviting us to do why because slowing down is worth it it is so worth it maybe it's time to slow down and to make room so that god can meet you and god can empower you and then situations will begin to change you will become bolder and you'll be able to step out of that prayer moment in power so let us pray right now [Music] god we thank you so much for being with us thank you that we get to be here now with you we get to meditate on your fame on your beauty god the whole world needs to know you because you're so good god how can we partner with you show us god would you meet us here today god we want to actually know you we want to actually spend time in your word not simply rushing to the next thing but making space making room so that you can transform us into your image you can challenge us you can mold us we're here now god we're present now thank you jesus we pray these things in jesus name amen thank you so much for joining me today we'll pick up our conversation tomorrow hopefully you can join us and if this has been helpful to you so far these clips would you share them with someone that you know could use them might be of benefit to them thank you and we'll connect again tomorrow god bless you [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] see so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] free [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so thank you [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hey [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you", "[Music] let's be honest we live expecting to be happier and more fulfilled when we have money money buys us stuff which gives us a thrill and it pays for things like insurance and savings to make us feel more secure but do money and stuff really make us happier even with the abundance of material goods we enjoy in our country it's telling that one of the biggest american pastimes is shopping we aren't satisfied because like an addiction will always crave something new or different and what about security does money really make us more secure you don't have to look very far to see once powerful and oh so secure fortunes crumbled by economic or natural disasters what truly fulfills us as human beings is to grow in knowledge and love of god and to be doers of his work in this world to be adventurers imaginers builders healers bringers of justice but if we want to be free and flourishing as god created us to be we have to deal first with our dependence on money if we don't learn to depend on god and to be generous to his work we'll never move from bondage to freedom we'll always be stuck living in tension anxiety and mediocrity because we do not fully trust god to provide for us if we were to step out so ask yourself are you willing to step out do you really believe that god will provide for you remember this jesus said do not be anxious about your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor about your body what you will put on your heavenly father knows that you need them all but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all of these things will be added to you [Music] all right good morning everyone good morning the um it's dark up here there we go so hello to all of you who made it in person and lynn and revere thanks for joining us today plenty of parking outside the uh also i want to say hello to all of you joining us online today i know that the vast majority of you are online and you have six to seven hours of shoveling to do in front of you so um if you have if you're online today this is for real we know that right now 57 percent of you that are watching online have not yet subscribed to our youtube channel so if you would go ahead and subscribe to our youtube channel that would help you to get the links uh automatically if we ever have to be remote again in just a moment i'm going to show you a video from one of our world outreach partner couples in the country of indonesia they are doing a great work and so i want you to pay attention and i want you to think carefully about what you're about to hear and your possible way to partner with them so let's go ahead and watch this video together [Music] hi this is jason and ng fuentes we and our four children have been living in indonesia for three years and god is doing amazing things indonesia is the fourth largest nation in the world and has the largest muslim population with a quarter of a billion people it's amazing to think that 60 have never heard the gospel for the past two years we've been pastoring at an international church and because of the great things that god is doing we have seen our church doubled and we're in the process of building the center which is going to be a hub for the things that god will continue to do in this island by using english as a tool it has opened a wide door for us to get into the local communities we get to go into local schools and teach children and youth we even use bible stories to teach them values it's a great opportunity and where we had the opportunity to do these open-air events we have seen hundreds of people respond to the message in our own island we have been able to go into the difficult to reach areas and when jesus shows up and people experience him amazing things happen this one lady who had two deaf children came and wanted prayer jesus opened up those deaf ears and this became so real to her that she invited us and our team to go into her village that is unreached to preach to everyone about the good news of who jesus is to her whole neighborhood god promised that he would reach this nation with the gospel so our dream for indonesia is that we would be able to raise up many local leaders to continue the ministry we have already been doing there has already been a church planted and we are so excited about doing much more church planning in the future and finally we just want to see the entire nation of indonesia get the message of jesus christ so we are so happy to share what god is doing and we're looking for people just like you who'll be able to stand with our family partner with us in prayer and in finances even sending teams we need people to be able to reach the on reach in these places within indonesia thank you and god bless [Music] all right that's great that's great now when i hear our missionaries that we support uh give reports and have opportunity to talk to them one of my great joys is this i know that i get to personally financially support our missionaries by giving to our missions and world outreach program here at the church so in case you're not aware of this whenever you give to finances to our world outreach program or missions it gets distributed amongst our three dozen missionaries that we support in missionary programs east coast international church you are making a difference for the kingdom of god around the planet because of your faithful giving at the same time i am also keenly aware of the fact that many of you wish you could be able to support these missionaries i don't think that there are many amongst us who hear from missionaries like jason and ng and think to yourselves oh i hope they that we can't support them i hope that we can't i hope that i never get a chance to financially help them that's not what people think not most people and today i want to use this idea of i wish i was able i wish i could do more i wish i did more you see i think that's a compulsion of the holy spirit saying to you and i listen carefully this is something i want you to be involved in now that doesn't necessarily mean and that you're supposed to take out your wallet and your purse and just empty it okay you're not supposed to go to your bank account and just empty it entirely most of the time every once in a while god will ask you to do that but that's not what i'm talking about today i'm not even going to receive an offering now that's not the point of the message today most often this compulsion that we feel is a compelling of the holy spirit to give but not for the short term for the long term and what that means is that you've got to get your financial house in order you see the compelling desire that you have within you to make a difference in the world to immediately want to to give to immediately want to help is oftentimes met by this wall of i can't well i simply don't have it and the holy spirit comes alongside of us and says hey it's time to get our financial houses in order so that we can do everything that god is asking us to do and so today i want to have a family meeting and so since most of you are online please don't turn me off today all right please plea please keep watching it's time to talk about money with my own girls we have regular discussions about money how money works how you should use money how you should not use money how you should be generous and it turns out jesus teaches a lot about money and what the overall themes and principles there are in the bible is also something we talk about as a family you see if you were to pull out the money that you have in your wallet right now it doesn't come with instructions on how to use it printed on them it doesn't tell you what to do it doesn't tell you the best thing to do with it it's kind of left up to you there's this great quote that i heard recently says i've been tripping on my shoelaces because no one taught me how to tie them they just kind of hit me as a very real thing that we face in life and i think it is the case with money if no one teaches us the correct way to use money the devil will teach you so just think about that for a minute who taught you how to use money and if you're like nobody taught me probably the devil taught you how to use money and in order for you to simply land flat on your face mastercard and visa are more than happy to teach you how to go into debt discover card in american express you're not off the hook either all forms of media all forms of them will encourage you to spend money on things you don't need and oftentimes don't even really want that's why you don't use them the way you thought you might the interesting thing is that money in fact has rules there are rules to money if you follow the rules around money you can master your money if you violate the rules money will master you and you will be its slave we have a whole country full of slaves to money this is a very problematic place we are in so today i want to help you today i want to help you today identify your current relationship with money what's your relationship to money today as you've heard me talk about in the past i think whenever you're interested in getting into a relationship some with somebody you need to check out all their relationships and one of the relationships you need to check out is their relationship with money you have a relationship with money and so do they but what's yours today are you the master of your money or is your money the master of you maybe it's not really your money it's just an illusion i don't mean do you have a little bit of money or do you have a lot of money that's not the point because even those with lots of money still wrestle with the exact same issues that those that have a little bit of money wrestle with perhaps you heard we talk about the millionaire who found about that god invites people to give a minimum of ten percent of their income he couldn't believe it ten percent he went and talked to his pastor and said pastor i can't possibly give ten percent i make way too much money [Music] he got himself an idol that's what that is money is his idol so come on today we're to start a journey it's not just going to end the day but would you join me today in beginning to tear down the idolatry of money in your life the idol of mammon it's time to stop bowing down to the false gods of this world which are led by mammon so today we begin to talk about the intersection of faith and finances it's a very important lesson for us today i'm not sure why the sundays that i preach on monday are the absolute quietest that's probably just because you're all online today yeah but anyhow so i know you're shouting me down from from online so matthew chapter six jesus is talking and jesus says this we're going to let a long passage today don't store up treasures here on earth where moths eat them and rust destroys them and where thieves break it and steal store your treasures in heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal wherever your treasure is there the desires of your heart will also be just think about that where you spend or put your money is where is evidence of where your desires are your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body when your eye is healthy your whole body is filled with light but when your eye is unhealthy your whole body is filled with darkness and the light you think you have is actually darkness how deep that darkness is jesus is so clever there no one can serve two masters i'll say that again jesus says no one can serve two masters for you will hate one and love the other you will be devoted to one and despise the other now watch this watch this that's fascinating two masters aren't allowed it can't even happen it's not possible and then he drops it boom you cannot serve god and be enslaved to money that's so interesting the first part of what jesus said is so true by itself but the point he's really trying to drive home is about money he's trying to warn us to let us know and jesus does this very clearly throughout his ministry he acknowledges this idea that the empire's system of wealth will attempt to get you to follow it instead of god it's a giant warning that money the great idol the great principality and power is competing is competing to try to get you to worship it instead of worship god jesus continues that is why i tell you not to worry about everyday life whether you have enough food or drink or enough clothes to wear isn't life more than food and your body more than clothing look at the birds they don't plant or harvest or store food in the barns or your heavenly father feeds them and aren't you far more valuable to him than they are can't all your worry can all your worries add a single moment to your life and why worry about your clothing look at the lilies of the field and how they grow they don't work or make their clothing yet solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are and if god cares so wonderfully for wild flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow he will certainly care for you why do you have so little faith again this is jesus talking so don't worry about these things saying what will we eat what will we drink what will we wear these things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers but your heavenly father already knows all your needs seek the kingdom of god and above all else live righteously and he will give you everything you need wow that's really good stuff jesus and it's something that we need to wrestle with and fight with and battle for in our life is that kind of an attitude towards things and money so one of the challenges of teaching this highly biblical theme is the reality that in a church our size we are at all different stages in our individual financial journeys nobody is like automatically in the same place so i want you today to think about your attitude towards money we all have an attitude towards money in fact there's five basic attitudes towards money and you fall into one of those five and we're gonna there's five s's here so i want you to think about which one is you just be really honest about it you're either surviving struggling stable secure or in surplus this is your attitude okay so what does it mean to be surviving surviving means you're feeling drained or trapped with little sense of hope people who are surviving with their attitude towards money worry about meeting the basic needs of life and every bit of what they earn goes to daily survival most in this group require financial assistance or a helping hand to get by that's surviving or struggling would be feeling trapped in a feeling strapped in the present and anxious about the future money causes much of the stress felt by those who are struggling as financial pressures build relationships with families friends and communities often begin to crack strugglers live paycheck to paycheck or worse slowly dig themselves deeper into debt or stable it's another attitude towards money stable feeling okay experiencing relative calm but hoping for more the stress level of stable might be a little bit lower but they don't yet feel secure they don't plan much for the future and likely aren't as generous as they want to be they describe themselves as just making ends meet and while this group doesn't live paycheck to paycheck they are one disaster away from real hardship and then there's secure feeling mostly confident those in this group that we call secure feel they have enough for themselves but probably not enough extra to share generously as their income grows so does their lifestyle expenses so they perpetually have just enough with only a little extra although having a financial strategy might increase their sense of security these people can be enslaved to saving as strugglers are to debt and then there's those in surplus feeling grateful and ready to share members of the surplus group believe they have more than enough they don't constantly long for more they display a high level of contentment even if their lifestyle is average or below their purchases match their needs not their income and because they feel grateful they are ready to share there's five s's there we fall into one of those categories each of us now my goal today is not to convince you to start giving more money my goal is to slowly and consistently help you to get to a place where you are living a life of surplus where gender and generosity is certainly part of that but the core of this is that my hope is that you will be wise with debt you will spend less than you make that you will have a short term and a long term plan that you will protect yourself against setbacks and that you will give of yourself five things in other words my hope is that you will be wise with money so over the next couple of weeks let's have some money talk in case you have forgotten money talk is spiritual talk tell your neighbor that right now money talk a spiritual talk so if you are watching online right now and you think that one of your friends is not watching online text them money talk is spiritual talk all right and you'll find out does that mean that talking about cryptocurrency and nft is a spiritual talk well in the right context it certainly does mean that so i don't understand what all this bitcoin stuff is all about maybe you do but billions of dollars are being committed to it and as a people of god that live in a broken world we need to understand what's going on with this stuff the systems the empires of this world need a moral compass and if we don't understand and think deeply through the issues of our time they will have no moral compass science technology social justice monetary systems entertainment education economics all need us to speak into those places and if we don't speak to those issues the devil certainly will and even the individuals with the absolute best of intentions can set us on a course of destruction unintentionally so good financial stewardship is one of the foundational elements of being a good and available disciple for jesus if you are financially a poor steward it will simply not be possible for you to be deployed into the arenas that god wants you to go literally god may have something for you over here that you can't access because of bad financial stewardship so let's have some honest conversations over the next few weeks and the first step to godly financial stewardship is simply honesty where are you today are you surviving struggling stable secure or in surplus this is what i would call an either or moment it's black or white it is what it is regardless of what you want it to be the question of the five s's isn't which of these would you like to be it's what are you right now the numbers don't lie now we live in a world that has a lot of and realities meaning lots of great areas it's this and this money's not like that your relationship with money is not that kind of a category either you are the master of your money or money is the master of you so if you're thinking to yourself right now i i don't think i'm the master of my money then it's your master that's the reality there's no grey space let's bring that brings us back to jesus mark chapter 4. once again jesus began teaching by the lakeshore and there's a few of us going to israel in a couple of weeks so you're going to actually be right at this exact spot a very large crowd soon gathered around him so he got into a boat then he sat in a boat while all the people remained on the shore he taught them by telling them stories in the form of parables such as this one listen a farmer went out to plant some seed as he scattered it across his field some of the seed fell on a footpath and birds came and ate it other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock the seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow but the plant soon wilted under the hot sun and since it didn't have deep roots it died another seed fell among the thorns and grew up and choked out to tender plants so they produced no grain still other seeds fell on fertile soil and they sprouted grew and produced a crop that was 30 60 and even 100 times as much as had been planted then he said anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand later when jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around they asked him what the parable meant he replied you are permitted to understand the secret of the kingdom of god but i use parables for everything i say to outsiders so that the scriptures might be fulfilled when they see what i do they will learn nothing when they hear what i say they will not understand otherwise they will turn to me and be forgiven then jesus said to them if you can't understand the meaning of this parable how will you understand the other parables the farmer plants seeds by taking god's words to others the seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message only to have satan come at once and take it away the seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy but since they don't have deep roots they don't last long they fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing god's word verse 18 the seed that fell among the thor's thorns represents others who hear god's words but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life the lure of wealth and the desire for other things so no fruit is produced look at that right in this parable jesus identifies that one of the key reasons that the faith the faith of people gets choked out one of the key reasons that people don't continue on in their journey of freedom is because of money it's technically the lure of wealth and the desire for other things the worries of this life it's really not money it's a problem it's the misunderstanding of money it's the voluntary submission to the leadership of money in your life rather than freely giving one's life to the leadership of jesus it's it's this jesus is making it clear throughout his ministry hey there's going to be a lot of things in your way there's going to be a lot of challenges by the way money is going to be fighting you the whole time money's going to be trying to steal this from you the entire time so don't be lured in by wealth or the deceptive desires of of the things of this world and the worries of this life they will only bring you to destruction and take you further from freedom the worship team comes back up so i have some homework for you today you're like i could have skipped this i could have been out shoveling the homework for everybody online homework too you're not exempt first off i want you to identify reality what is your money attitude which of those five s's are you write it down have an honest conversation with jesus about it second i want you to wrestle with this question all

sacrifice if you sacrifice like watching netflix appropriate to sacrifice if it was things that are more important perhaps not and then i want you to read something this week i want you to go to luke chapter 15 and i want you to read the most famous parable that jesus ever told the parable of the prodigal son i want you to read the parable of the prodigal son but i want you to read it a little differently than perhaps you've ever heard it before or read it before i want you to read it with a financial or economic lens and see what you learn as you're reading it think oh how does how does economy impact this how do how does money impact the story it starts off with the one son asking the father for his inheritance early so there's a money transfer so you can you can just go through and i just want you to want you to think about it why don't you all stand with me right now if you're in revere right now why don't you stand with us well we're not quite done yet [Music] i want you to

[Music] one of my favorite things to preach and teach is an area of financial stewardship [Music] because it is one of the most freeing opportunities that we have every year it can make an immediate and transformative change in your life that will catapult other areas of your your faith and so as the worship team leads us in this last song i want you to pray and reflect and give it to god just

[Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] you", "[Applause] all right good morning everybody all right the uh in a in a world that is exceptionally confused today God has called us as a church to preach good news to the poor to heal the broken to bring freedom for the captive and justice for the oppressed our world can't agree on hardly any of those words but it is critically important that we understand particularly what Justice for the oppressed means in this Saturday October 29th is the beginning of our Justice Conference and I encourage you all to come it starts at 9am uh for a Time there'll be four sessions throughout the day Bishop Walter Harvey is coming we're going to be talking about these uh specific things a Biblical Justice racial reconciliation and uh Christian Community Development uh here in the city of Lynn and Revere so we are going to be working on those things because that is the direction that we have been in for a long time and will continue to be so uh so please join us I cannot express uh hardly enough how important it is for you to come to this uh weekend every Christmas my family gathers together from around the country and around the world to go to Wisconsin Dells Wisconsin just a little town in Wisconsin to celebrate Christmas the Dells are home to some of the largest water parks in the world and because it's cold in Wisconsin in the winters they have huge indoor water parks so on Christmas Eve I don't know if that deserves an amen or not I'm not sure I'm not sure just just foreign Christmas Eve our plane landed in Chicago and we quickly drove North to the Dells and I was so excited to show uh my uh my only daughter at the time Kyla this fancy indoor water park with its giant indoor water slides once we arrived we quickly got situated we headed to the water slides we climbed up the tall stairs of these giant indoor water slides and this giant indoor water park we get to the top and it's kind of terrifying especially if you're six so Kyla just looked at me and shook her head like I'm not going down that's scary and I said this I said how about we go down together without missing a beat she jumped right on and we had a great time on the water slides she wasn't afraid why because I was with her I was with her and that little girl is now 21 years old today so happy birthday Kyle I don't she's gonna adult now so I don't have to pay her when I use her in sermon illustrations anymore you're like how do your kids okay with that because I pay them if I say their name on Sunday so Isaiah chapter 41 teaches us the same thing do not fear for I Am With You why don't you fear because God is with you not because things aren't hard not because everything's gonna be easy but because God is with you and that's fundamentally all that ever matters God is with you do not be dismayed for I am your God somebody say God is with me God is with me today we're going to get up and we are going to walk on out of fear so as we wrap up our walk on out series we are walking out of fear and I think this is a really good thing to walk on out of if you've ever been afraid if you've ever been fearful if you've ever wrestled with fear or worry are all the thousands of other ways that we say fear this sermon is for you today fear is one of the absolute earliest emotions that we remember we remember kind of those early fear moments in our life if we kind of Peg kind of early memories to fear a lot of times a lot of fears we even make up ways to be afraid nowadays we're so afraid of everything like a paraphobia that is not the fear of pairs that is the fear of infinity no maybe maybe now I just gave you a new fear something to be afraid of now you're afraid of infinity sorry or arberophobia which is the fear of gravity or Chrono sorry chronomentrophobia which is the fear of clocks dendrophobia the fear of trees epistemophobia is the fear of knowledge or francophobia which is the fear of France why is anybody afraid of France people afraid that's an era that might be in the category of irrational fears right there genophobia the fear of knees or a common common fear in the United States homologphobia is the fear of sermons fear of sermons right there homologphobia so nobody has that here I know the um I once read that the IRS there's more people afraid of the IRS or that have the fear of the IRS than the fear of God that's because money is their God where did fear come from anyway stupid thing let's take a look at how fear entered the world fear is not clearly not a good thing Genesis chapter 3 let's go to the beginning because that's where it showed up now pay attention closely now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made he said to the woman did God really say You must not eat from any tree in the garden the woman said to the serpent we may eat fruit from the trees in a garden but God did say you must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden and you must not touch it or you will die you will not surely die the serpent said to the woman for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be open and you will be like God knowing Good and Evil when a woman saw the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it she also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realized they were naked so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and they hid from the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden but the Lord God Called To The Man where are you he answered I heard you in the garden and I was afraid first moment of fear there it is first moment of fear there it is right there I was afraid because I was naked so I hid so here in Genesis we have the first record of fear entering the universe we have a man and a woman in a perfect setting and perfect harmony with nature with each other and with God and into this paradise comes a creature that Jesus would later call the father of lies and he twists God's words Adam and Eve's Choice causes them to unleash sin the curse and fear upon the whole universe thank you very much fear that ever since has plagued Humanity with terrible consequences Proverbs 29 says this the fear of man will prove to be a snare a snare that's not a good thing that's a trap that's something to get you off track to keep you captive if you are afraid of men the fear of men will prove to be a snare but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe many seek an audience with a ruler but it is from the Lord that man gets Justice fear of man is a snare it is a trap and here's what this is the Trap of fear fear will tie you up it'll keep you in bondage okay it'll lock you fear will also create irrational behavior in your life the this this irrational Behavior can cost you time it can cost you connections it can cost you your life purpose irat fear comes with a terrible price tag fear also can cause us to do something terrible it can cause us to misrepresent God we could misrepresent God in fact many people Their Fear is actually how they see God they see God through the lens of fear and as a result it can just it confuses who they think God is in fact they get God all wrong as a result of it they even attach bible verses to fears like that it's okay to be afraid of God this happens because many people know the Bible but they actually have no idea what it means they don't understand the Bible and so they represent God as a vindictive angry dictator of the universe and so they live in a Perpetual anger live in this anger sense of God being angry with them all the time and they pass that on to their friends their family their kids and it's very unfortunate because the misunderstanding of the fear of God as being afraid of him instead of being in awe of him and his awesomeness we we know the Bible says the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom but it's his awesomeness the overwhelming nature of someone that we cannot possibly understand or comprehend is not being afraid of fear breaks and tears up or tears down relationships fear paralyzes us it makes people like dead people literally people that live in fear if you live in fear there are moments when you just make no decision because you are afraid to make a decision therefore making a decision and missing out on life Adam and Eve it could be almost put on there a tombstone we were afraid and hid we were afraid in it hoping to somehow maybe no one would notice that the universal curse of sin had been Unleashed upon everything and everyone maybe just maybe God won't notice that they were afraid and hid and ever since Adam and Eve started hiding from God Humanity has been hiding from God ever since there is no good fear in the world except for the fear of the Lord the Bible speaks positively about the fear of the Lord which is to recognize his awesomeness but negatively about the fears that have the potential to bind us up Romans 8 says this you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear but you received the spirit of sonship and by him we cry Abba Father we are in right in good and whole relationship with God he doesn't give us fear if you have fear you can unequivocally say that is not from God because he doesn't give it so what's God's answer to fear so if if fear is something that God doesn't want us to be ruled by it would make sense that he would give us a path out that there would be a path a way to live in Freedom away from its bondages the greatest Revelation that we have is the is the love of God in the in the face of the love of God fear begins to lose its grip see fear can't hold on when the love of God is present it has to let go God personifies his love to us he gives us his living example of his love for us in his son Jesus so that we have a clear understanding of who God is and what he is like so we get this really practical understanding of God's love for us in Jesus Colossians chapter 2 says it like this for in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body so if you want to know who God is know who Jesus is because it's all the fullness of God in a human body so you are also complete through your union with Christ who is the head over every ruler and Authority that's why we find out in John chapter 3. for this is how God loved the world how he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish to have eternal life that's how you know that's the love of God first John 4 16 says and so we know and rely on the love God has for us God is love whoever lives in love lives in God and God in him in this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because in this world we are like him there is no fear in love say it with me there is no fear in love hold on to that friends that there is fear going on in a situation or a relationship there is no fear in love so something's off but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love so Jesus comes and demonstrates God's love by giving his life in our place the answer to these Earthly cursed fears uh is simply a life of freedom in Christ you want to overcome live a life in the freedom of Christ the uh the perfect demonstration of God's love for us is simply Jesus so the first answer to how do you overcome fear is Jesus it's Jesus now what else you need to do well you need to find some spiritual Guardians in your life you need to set up you need to set up some spiritual centuries uh look out for you to have your back kind of like in my car I have Lane assist you know Elaine assisted you're gonna press this button and so when you're texting while you're wait sorry when you're just like a little distracted while you're driving and uh and and and then your car goes off a little bit just a little bit and uh and all of a sudden it turns you back returns you back I even have an alert in my car it tells me I need to pull over and get a drink of coffee it's like a little Guardian on my car little centuries watching out for me we all need these sentries in our life These spiritual centuries uh these spiritual Guardians to help us to help you so that you don't get off track so even right here with the church right this very second we have people stationed throughout the building they're here to help you to serve you to protect you to keep things proper and in order they are in effect your Guardians and thank you very much by the way everybody thanks for doing that so when they ask you to do something do it make their life easy please thank you thank you and turn your cell phones off so they don't have to come in the middle of the service to help you figure out how to turn off your cell phone you need to have these Guardians here's what they're really called in spiritual formation they're called spiritual disciplines prayer is a century like it's a guardian for you the study of the word of God is another Guardian against fear silence and reflection listening to the voice of the spirit is another Guardian true accountability not pretend accountability true accountability real community you see just showing up in church on a Sunday morning can very quickly turn into religion instead of community you've got to take the next step to go to community that's a guardian for you gathering together for worship that was disrupted during the pandemic and people are still trying to figure out how to get back together fasting worship praying in tongues listen if you've been given a spiritual language then don't neglect praying in tongues God's given it to you so use it there's other spiritual disciplines that probably 20 years ago I wouldn't have called a spiritual discipline but now in a modern world I'm like yeah these are definitely spiritual disciplines things like showing up that's a spiritual discipline like showing up every time not just once but there's 10 things you're supposed to show up for one doesn't mean you showed up okay showing up all the time or going to bed on time going to bed at a reasonable hour so that you can get a proper night's sleep that is a spiritual discipline like how did that become a spiritual discipline ever since Netflix or Waking Up like listen just waking up it's a spiritual discipline like if you're on to like hour 13 of sleep you got some issues all right take care of it turning off your phone from time to time like every day or putting it aside or not making it sleep with you whatever it is okay these disciplines all of them have a way of being able to save your life like little Guardians soldiers and centuries watching your back because those Guardians Sound the Alarm like my Lane assist do they guard the alarm they say on the alarm say hey hey you're off track you're off track you're venturing into fear territory right now you've got some fear going on you need to take care of it right now before it becomes a big fear well it's just a little fear and this is what happens Isaiah 59 says this when you do all these things when the enemies shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him so the enemy's right there fears attacking you and like a flood God's going to come in and wipe it out the message says this for the spirit the holy spirit will arrive like a river in flood stage whipped to a torrent by the wind of God so you got to have these things in place to take care of these challenges that we Face these spiritual battles with this understanding and these disciplines you can speak with authority to the situations in your life and as we weave these disciplines these Guardians into our lives they begin to replace fear you see as they begin to replace fear you get some of your time back that fear had stolen you get some of your effort and energy back that fear had stolen from you when your mind is focused and thinking of spiritual things it begins to replace those fearful thoughts so you fill your mind with the spiritual in order to remove the fearful when your life is being filled with the voice of the spirit the voices of fear have to back down they have to let go now we have a cultural challenge to this I don't know if this is a cultural challenge everywhere but I assume it is particularly here on the North Shore we have an ever increasing presence and almost celebration of self-medication this is what I would call the use of alcohol and marijuana to try to get rid of the feelings the feelings that's the devil friends and it's not going to play around with it it's the devil and some of you smoked it right before you came in and you need to not smoke it on the way out all right it is a form of self-medication that is designed to help and trap you with a snare of fear for the rest of your life it actually makes things worse over the Long Haul instead we're instructed by scripture on how to address these fears these feelings these uncomfortable things that are going on in our life we are instructed on how to do it okay so I want to challenge you today begin to challenge your thinking challenge your thinking if you think a thought that doesn't necessarily mean it's a right thought to think you're allowed to say to your thought you're incorrect get yourself in line if you got a rabid coyote in your backyard you're thinking I don't how are you going to get a rabid coyote in your backyard listen if you live in Lynn I don't know what they got going on down the Revere but in Lynn there's things that come out of the woods in my backyard we've had deer and bunnies and every kind of bird and raccoons I would say rabbits we had we had dogs we had turkeys and we had a coyote in our backyard what rabbit coyote now you got a choice when you have a coyote in your backyard you are going to decide are you going to leave that coyote right there and hide in your house for the rest of your life or if you're going to get rid of the coyote somebody like I'm not getting rid of that coyote he can stay out there as long as he wants I'm just going to stay in my side and be safe listen but you will never have your backyard you'll never be able to leave your house if you're like but I don't know how to get rid of a coyote Pastor you just call somebody that does know how to get rid of a coyote that's all you have to do you get rid of the coyote and so friends sometimes you've got to call somebody that knows how to deal with it better than you that's why we have power in the name of Jesus we can confront every situation in the name of Jesus because of sin we all have wrong messed up thinking patterns and paradigms and we get ourselves into all kinds of crazy foolishness and stupidness but in the name of Jesus all of that has to relent those thoughts of fear that have consumed your life you need to begin to challenge that thought process head on because fear is a bully an intimidating bully that has convinced a multitude of people to cower before it so changing fearful thinking paradigms is not easy but in Christ Jesus it is possible so nobody's saying any of this is easy nobody's saying hey you've got to take care of this in the next 36 seconds all right it's going to take a minute to figure this out resist the enemy those thoughts that he snares you with those fears and he will flee from you resist the enemy in the name of Jesus and he will flee from you so don't just challenge your thinking but take a stand I'm going to say something very direct to you it is not God's will that you are captive to fear it is not God's will that you are captive to fear so take a stand against those feelings you know feelings are not always facts feelings are informers but they're not always facts sometimes your feelings are wrong how is it what Disney does not think this is true follow your heart friends follow your heart your feelings are not always true they're not always correct they will lead you in the wrong path often times that's also another sermon sorry the uh so with your feelings and fear particularly with fear do not give fear a bedroom in your house that guest bedroom is not for fear that couch out there not for fear do not give fear a seat at your dinner table when fear knocks on your door don't don't cower behind the door but instead call on Jesus and together crush the fear and take no prisoners take there are some fears that you are going to overcome in your life in the name of Jesus that will never again make an appearance in your life you will overcome it once and for all for good and forever there are some of those fears that that happens with but there are also other fears there are some other fears that you have to face over and over again because we live in a broken and fallen and confusing world and you have to face them over and over again but over time you get the tools necessary spiritually to fight back and to break the bondage that it has in your life and when we make a choice to immediately stand against those things they lose their strength they lose their strength so we don't need to fear instead we feed ourselves on the word of God and we begin to starve the fear that is coming after us as the worship team comes up we'll close with this there is a place reserved for followers of Christ when the storms come at you when fear is Raging and the winds howl and the Giants rage when fear is all about we must learn to still our thoughts to meditate and pray on the word of God and to internalize the world the word and allow fear to be broken in our life Psalm 91 says this is what you need to do he who dwells in the shelter of the most high will rest in the shadow of the almighty and I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in whom I trust you run to the Tower of Refuge of God you run to his Strong Tower when you are afraid you run to Jesus when you are afraid or fearful you go to Jesus he is your Refuge he is your Fortress he is your strong tower and when you are there you do not need to be afraid foreign facing the fear that you've been facing recently you could name it in your mind just name it and as I read this next passage of scripture I want you to do something with that fear I want you to take that fear in your mind and I want you to rub it up against the cheese grater you know what a cheese grater does it takes a big old thing and just you know you got all this other stuff but I want you to cheese grate that fear in your life I don't want to have any power in your life anymore so you take it and you force it you take the fear and you force it against the word of God against the truth of who Jesus is and do that as I read this scripture right now so take it take that Romans 8 if God is for us who can be against us just rub it against that cheese grater he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things so God's going to provide for me that's not a fear I need to have who will bring any charge against Those whom God has chosen it is God who justifies who is he that condemns Christ Jesus who died more than that who was raised to life is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us so God is on our side Jesus is fighting for us I'm not alone in this who shall separate us from the love of Christ nobody shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword no keep on keep on great and Friends as it is written for your sake we Face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us for I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels or demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our lord now listen if you did that exercise with me you got no fear left okay you just keep rubbing because that was the whole thing right there so you just gotta keep on doing that you got to keep on doing it without every single fear that comes into your life keep on doing it over and over and over again until it's just habit it's a century it's a guardian you don't have to go find it it's got you already why don't you stand with me as we close [Music] so a couple questions for you to ask yourself as we close is there a discipline that you need to set up as a guardian in your life maybe as I was going through that list you're like I have no Guardians right now you need some Guardians you need some sentries around your life go ahead and put those in install those into your life if right now you are going through it the storm the tsunami the Hurricanes of Life are raging with you right now it is time to run to the Fortress of Peace today and that is Jesus Christ run as fast as you can to Jesus and don't let go and don't let go Maybe today some of you have come in here and you have a have come to realize that perhaps you have a slightly warped sense of God maybe you've seen God your whole life through a lens of fear like the wrong kind of fear and it's warped your sense of God and you've just been waiting for God to squash you you've been performing for God trying to be good for God because you think he won't like you if you're not and your sense of God has become warped and maybe today you need to re-understand that God is revealed to us in Jesus Christ look at Jesus if you want to look at God and let that love flow onto you today the worship team will close us with this as they do respond however you like the altars are open today foreign", "what's going on East Coast International Church good okay y'all brought the energy this morning I love it I love it it is good to be with you guys today my name is Pastor Jesse I'm the youth and media Pastor here at East Coast International Church and and first and foremost I just want

weird city names man I know I'm telling you New Jersey kind of beats a couple of them Hackensack hospital and I remember growing up in the five long years of my life uh and this apartment complex this huge apartment complex with a bunch of Apartments not like the nice phones we see across the street they were like small apartments and you know maybe there might be a roach here and there but there were awesome Apartments nonetheless uh but I was little that's what the first five years of my life in New Jersey and obviously I don't remember too much because I left when I was five but for some weird reason maybe you could relate like I have these these weird glimpses these Vivid memories of of my time there um like I remember living in this awesome building and I remember hanging out with all of like the we don't call them neighborhood kids because it was literally just a building with a bunch of kids so I don't know what to call them but they were our neighbors uh but none of them were my friends they were my my my brother's friends my sister's friends and I was that like annoying sibling that my mom made me like go with them just so I can hang out with them and I just remember hanging out with them all the time I remember the times when like the the building would have like an electric outage far too often like there was always a blackout like every couple months and so what we would do is all the kids would gather together and we'd go to the basement where like they had the laundry room and stuff and it was Pitch Black and we would play Manhunt like you ever heard of Manhunt it's like pretty much hide and go seek but scary and sketchy uh but I also have a memory and I think a lot of us might have this memory but I remember being outside and playing in hot weather and getting thirsty and and on the side of a building was this water hose and there was a spigot right there and I remember that when we were thirsty we would go to this water hose to drink from me you guys ever drank from a water hose when you were young like that was the thing that y'all did right like it was a childhood Norm Ally and for some weird reason we never thought too much about like the potential problems of drinking from a water hose that's been left outside for all four seasons many of us here are like what's wrong with that right until you hear about like the things you might find inside of a hose left in unsanitary conditions like the bacteria that could probably be growing inside the hose getting into the water or or the other bugs and insects that decided to make their home into these holes I saw a couple of y'all raise your hands you probably swallowed a spider without even realizing so there's that we were probably drinking like this bad nasty water and didn't even know but we were kids right we were thirsty we weren't thinking about these things we were just trying to quench this thirst that we had when I was living in Malden playing basketball every summer with my friends and and I forgot to bring my water bottle in those 90 degree days I remember after a couple games getting thirsty I was hot and I looked in my bag and I'm like ah I forgot my water and I would go to a friend and and I would say bro like let me get some of your water and he would tell me let me drink the first half I'll give you the last bit of it I said okay so what did I do I would watch him drink the first half and then when the bottom half was all that was left I would take it from him and drink that's what I did I didn't think about how all the way in the bottom was probably where all of my friends saliva and spit and backwasher sat at and how like the last bit that he gave me was probably like 25 all saliva I was drinking bad saliva water but I wasn't thinking about the saliva water I was just thirsty simply trying to just quench my thirst a number of times in my life where out of a pursuit to quench my thirst I found myself drinking from places that were bad let's just let's just go ahead and admit it oh those were nasty places maybe you can relate to the times when you were thirsty and you were just looking for the next thing to drink and instead of deciding maybe I should get an ice cold water you just walked into a 7-Eleven and got a big golf right the largest bottle of coke you can find or maybe you went straight to dunks and got a large iced regular well extra extra I know some of y'all be liking that sugar or maybe you drink a little bit of that sugar water called Gatorade from CVS right and you were drinking these things drinking there trying to quench this thirst that in the moment may have quenched it but realizing that those were not the best options but in those moments you were not thinking about what the drinks contained you were not thinking about the idea of what is it that I'm grabbing you were just trying to quench a thirst that you had you see I I believe in our lives we carry more than just this natural thirst in our bodies but we also carry a spiritual thirst in us too maybe for you it's a thirst for happiness or peace or Freedom a thirst for purpose or or maybe it's a thirst for for belonging maybe you guys are thirsty you don't even know what you're thirsty about all right I had a student of mine last week read me this poem that he made like on the spot I was driving him home and he was talking about how like uh like the I want more in this area of a life I want more in this area and in the end he would capture this one sentence where he was like I want more but I don't even know what that more even is I feel like a lot of us can relate to that right like we're just thirsty for more but we don't even know what that more is and out of our pursuit to quench our thirst we oftentimes find ourselves going to whatever place we think contains the very thing we need to quench it but instead we actually find that those places only contain bad water like the water holes or my friend saliva nasty stuff right places like addiction places like sin places like opportunities places like relationships places that may have treated your thirst all before a moment still leaving you thirsty with the need for more maybe there are some of us here in this room today who have consumed so much bad water from all sorts of places in our attempts to quench our thirst that you're coming in here today finding yourselves with nothing but that thirst and all this bad water that you now carry from those places and maybe you're wondering man will this quench that I have ever be fulfilled maybe there's some of us here who you're walking in you know exactly how that water you carry looks and you're wondering maybe this is the best I'll ever get maybe there is nothing more for me and in John chapter 4 we find Jesus on one of his epic Ministry Journeys and on this journey he got tired and decided to stop at this village where he has this unique encounter we read it here in John 4 beginning on verse 3 and this is what the Bible says then Jesus went from the country of Judea to the country of Galilee he had to go through Samaria on the way eventually he came to the Samaritan Village of sakar near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph Jacob's Well was there and Jesus tired from The Long Walk sat weirdly beside the well about noon time soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water and Jesus said to her please give me a drink he was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food the woman was surprised for Jews refused to have anything to do with Samaritans she said to Jesus you're a Jew and I'm a Samaritan woman why are you asking me for a drink we see here that Jesus sends his disciple out to go get a four for four I Wendy's right because all hungry and stuff and he decides that on his way he he wants to stop at the Samaritan Village because he's tired from this long walk that he was on if you want to know the Long Walk that Jesus was tired from we have two stairs in this building and once you reached the top of those steps man you like out of breath can't even get a sentence out of your mouth just go up downstairs and you will know the tire that Jesus is talking about I swear every time I go up downstairs it just reminds me of how unfit I am it's terrible but anyways in this Village Jesus finds this well and he goes to sit beside this wall and he looks across from him and he sees that he's not alone he encounters that there's also a woman there drawing from the very water at the well he's sitting at and the first thing Jesus Does is he goes out of his way directly to her and he asks for some of her water and it says that the woman was surprised that he was asking for her water that she was drawing you see our first glance we don't see much going on here it's just water right why is she so surprised but I believe the reason for the woman's response is because this was not the only place she found herself drinking from this was not the only place she possessed water from or or in this case this was not the only well she Drew water from track with me here we learned that this woman is a Samaritan Samaritans were people who were half Jewish and have Gentile and just not to not get into into it but when the people of Assyria capture the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 721 BC some were taken into captivity and others were left behind the people of Israel that were left behind intermarried with the Assyrians and because of that they were half and half right and in this this process there was an intermingling of ideas of cultures and there was even an intermingling of idol worship that was happening and at the time of Jesus the Jews and the Samaritans did not deal with one another because of these things this is why it's weird that Jesus is even talking to her the Samaritans were not liked culturally speaking Jesus should have just gone out of his way he just kept going about his day he was not supposed to talk to Samaritan people because whoever carried that label were considered unclean outcasts who should not be around the clean ones because if they are around the clean ones then the clean people become unclean and so it's just a whole mess and so the Samaritans were just they avoided them and because of this we see that this woman was drawing from this well called rejection cultural and historical traditions of that time tells us that women typically Drew water in groups it happened in the morning while the water in the well was cool and the sun wasn't beaming on it and and it was at these Wells that these social occasions would rise about with these women that's where the all the women would go draw water talk about the Tea of the neighborhood this is going on with my husband your husband doing that you know all this stuff right like right there in those Wells this is where these conversations would take place but in a culture where this was the societal Norm we find this woman in particular all alone not amongst the crowd drawing water at noon which was the heat of day meaning that the sun has been beaming on this water for hours now so the water wasn't even good to drink like y'all ever been hot and thirsty and drank lukewarm water it's like the nastiest thing ever and so imagine this woman journeying from her house to the well in the he of day arriving at the well sweating carrying this load with her only to drink from water that wasn't even good and she had to walk back in the same conditions and that's what she settles for not because she wanted to but because even in a community of Samaritans who were social outcasts amongst the rest of the groups she was an outcast among them she was an outcast of the outcasts and we find that here because she was all alone not around with anybody she was also drawing from this well called isolation and that's not even it we also discover as Jesus points out later in the story that she's been in five marriages each ending the same way and before some of us in here start thinking like man this girl got some commitment issues right that's not what was happening during these times women were not seeing the way that we see them now they did not possess the rights they have now they were not as respected as they are now they they were sometimes even seen more in the realm of property than than a person like these women weren't going about seeing who they wanted to date they weren't having any hot girls Summers or anything like that like like these women they they needed that security because men did not see them as equals so what the five marriages actually tells me is not that she had commitment issues it tells me that she was promised to security and love and provision and the unity that a marriage brings us somewhere along the way it did not work out like she had hoped and she probably thought in her second attempt Maybe This Time Around things will be different only to have the same thing happen to her not twice but five times this was probably the reason she was outcasted from her community too like if they didn't want her why would we want her this is this is probably why she avoided the groups because she was probably the topic of conversations time and time again being judged and scorned and all of those things through all this you got to wonder if she still had hope that there was even any value in her up to this point if there was anyone that would love her or at the very least anyone that would even see her we see here that she was probably drawing from The Well of hopelessness and to cap it all off she was living with the man who was not even married to her another thing people probably mentioned in their gossip and in her judgment and because of this every time she'd come home she knew that she was drawing from The Well of sin and she was also drawn from the well a shame that would come from this sin but she still chose to live in it day after day not because this was the best decision for her but because it was the only source of security that she was able to have and after knowing all of this I imagine that her water didn't really look clear but that the water that Jesus was asking for was kind of like this maybe a little algae fill a little bacteria nasty stuff maybe they got some Critters in a little spider right water that did not look presentable that did not look safe for anyone to drink and every time she walked to and from this well In the Heat of day she was constantly reminded of the wells that she was forced to draw from that led to these results the wells that she chose to draw from that led to these results and so when all of a sudden a man like Jesus who wasn't he was supposed to be talking to her approaches her to ask for some of this water I understand why she's so surprised I imagine her questions are like you're asking for some of my water like don't you know the town where you're at don't you know what they say about my people don't you know what my people say about me do you know how warm and and lukewarm the water is right now it's not even the right time to be drinking this do you even know how unclean my hands are the the hands I even Drew this water aren't you the clean one if you drank what I have do you not know the things that it could happen to you do you not know that you would become unclean I imagine a woman just saying why would you ever want some of my water in church the answer to this question is because that's exactly what Jesus came here to do second Corinthians 5 21 says God made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of God and one of the most vulnerable moments we see in the life of Jesus here on Earth we read this prayer moments before his arrest where he says father if you are willing please take this cup of suffering away from me yet I want your will to be done not mine so often we hear that through the death and the resurrection of Jesus we have forgiveness of our sins that we have right relationship with God and this is all true and amazing this is the good news but we have to remember to not Overlook the fact that he didn't just die for your sins he became it the ACT which is explained as Jesus drinking from the cup of suffering you know what made this cup so hard to drink it wasn't that it was filled with some bitter black coffee with no cream or sugar or anything like that what made this cup hard to drink is that it contained the world's dirty muddy water that we've all drawn from the wells of sin and shame and rebellion and hopelessness and the list goes on this is the picture of the Cross Church that while our water was contaminated with the bacteria of sin Jesus came to drink our muddy dirty water and suffer the consequences of it so that we would not have to and many of us have believed in this lie that the water we possess the substance in our lives needs to look Crystal Clear before God wants anything to do with us that it needs to look Crystal Clear before God wants to have any encounter with us that it needs to look Crystal Clear before we have anything to offer up to God but Jesus shows us here in John 4 that he wants whatever you have so much that rather than waiting for you and waiting for what you think is the right time to come to him he's come to you the Samaritan woman went at the time that she did to avoid people to avoid interactions to avoid the crowds but Jesus still came it didn't matter what her situation looked like it didn't matter what her status looked like or her current lifestyle looked like or the decisions that she was making Jesus wanted to meet her and all that she came with it didn't matter what her water looked like and I don't know what wells you've been drawing from to quench your thirst but what I do know today church is that Jesus has journeyed exactly to where you're at to meet you and let you know that he wants your water that you've been drawing he wants you and all that you come with it doesn't matter what your water looks like Jesus wants it it doesn't matter if you've been drawn from the wells of sin Jesus wants it it doesn't matter if you've been drawn from the walls of addiction Jesus wants it it doesn't matter if you've been drawn from the wells of bad decisions of mistakes of insecurities of fear depression anxiety whatever you've been drawing from Jesus wants your water there is no well that draws water that's too bad for Jesus to take in because he already drank the dirtiest of waters and the beauty of this is that he is not just asking you to give him your water just so that you can be clean still being left to thirst he is asking for our water so that he can offer something better for us the story continues in verse 10 like this Jesus replied if you only knew the gift God has for you and who you are who you are speaking to you would ask me and I would give you living water but sir you don't have a rope or a bucket she said and this well is very deep where would you get this living water and besides do you think you're greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us this well how can you offer better water than he and his sons and his animals enjoyed Jesus replied anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again but those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again it becomes a fresh bubbling spring within them giving them eternal life please sir the woman said give me this water then I'll never be thirsty again and I won't have to come here to get water Jesus told this woman that if she only knew the gift God had for her if she if she knew that who she was speaking to that she would ask Jesus for water instead and that he would give her not just any normal regular water but living water this is the same Living Water that Jesus speaks of later in John 7 when he says that anyone who believes in me may come and drink for the scriptures declare rivers of Living Water will flow from his heart when he said Living Water he was speaking of the spirit who would be given to everyone believing in him but the spirit had not yet given because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory this living water spoken about here is the work of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives it's the work of the holy spirit that fully quenches our innermost thirst it's his work that stirs us to produce his fruits of love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control and the work that satisfies and prospers those the Holy Spirit lives in this is the Living Water that Jesus is offering to us but I love the woman's response she goes you don't even have a rope or a bucket with you like these walls are deep like where are you going to get this water and plus the world that we're sitting at came from our ancestor like everybody drained from this world this is already good water like are you saying your water is better than his you see this woman had this thought that the Living Water Jesus offered could be drawn from the places that she's always gone to she thought that a well named after someone who is well respected but who is dead for a long time a well named after someone who's not even around anymore she thought that this well could possess the Living Water that Jesus was offering but he replies to anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again what Jesus is saying here is that the water that he provides cannot be found in any other well that we find ourselves drawing from as a matter of fact he's making a very clear distinction between the water that's found in the Holy Spirit and the water that's found in the wells of the world if his living water is living that means any other water is dead it's dead water that makes us thirsty again but it's Living Water that truly quenches our thirst it's dead water that hydrates our bodies just for a moment but it's Living Water that hydrates our souls for eternity if this woman is to want to begin drawing Living Water of God's spirit that she has to abandon the dead wells in her life that she's always been drawing from and as long as she goes back to the same old wells in her life she's going to continue to be unsatisfied to be left disappointed and still thirsty because the only thing she's drinking is just dead water and what we learn here is that you can't draw living water from dead walls all that living water has to offer you cannot be found in any other well other than the well of the Holy Spirit and many times we desire so much the things of the Holy Spirit the attributes that come in the Holy Spirit we desire that living water but we search the dead Wells all around us instead of The Well of the Holy Spirit we desire to draw the true love of the Holy Spirit but are seeking it in the wells of relationships we desire to draw true peace that the Holy Spirit provides but we seek it in the worlds of just circumstances and opportunities we desire to draw true fulfillment that the Holy Spirit offers us but we seek it in the wells of sin and temporary Pleasures the list goes on and what we find is that each time we try to draw living water from all these dead Wells we too just come up disappointed and discouraged finding ourselves thirsty and tired again and again it's because we can't draw living water from dead Wells if it's Living Water that we're after the only way we'll ever be able to draw it out is by abandoning those Wells that we've been going to and begin to seek drawing from the Holy Spirit and so this woman right she asks for The Living Water that Jesus speaks up he convinced it she's like all right where is it and at this point she doesn't really know who Jesus is yet she really just thinks he's just an ordinary Jewish man that just came along and when she asked him for Living Water he responded by asking her to go and get her husband and the woman responded I don't have a husband right she kind of gave this like half truth you know and listened to Jesus response he says you've had five husbands and you aren't even married to the man you're living with now you certainly spoke the truth and when Jesus said this man I want to believe so bad that there was like this tint of sarcasm that like I know I know you think you don't you know what you're doing but I know the whole story but after Jesus I called out her business right or or in a better sense he was calling out some of the dead whales in her life the woman replied by saying like you must be a prophet you know all that stuff about me there's nothing special about you man right and she begins to ask him a question about this true place of worship because the Jews worship God in one location and the Samaritans thought that they they worship God in another location and and Jesus begins to tell her that there will come a time that the geographical location of worship will not matter that true worshipers will worship the father and spirit and in truth and and the woman probably having this slight regard for his answer goes listen I know the Messiah is coming the one who is called the Christ when he comes he will explain everything to us and then Jesus responds to one of the best liners he goes like I am the Messiah like you now you now you know who you're talking to right yeah and here's what happens next though John 4 27. just then his disciples came back they were shocked to find him talking to a woman but none of them had the nerve to ask what do you want with her or why are you talking to her the woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the Village telling everyone come and see a man who told me everything I ever did could he possibly be the Messiah so the people came streaming from the village to see him the disciples returned to Jesus and even they were confused as to why he was associating with this woman but look at at verse 28 it says that the woman left her water jar beside the well when she finally realized who it was that she was talking to and what he was offering for her life she no longer needed her water jar because the thirst of her soul was finally quenched in that very moment you see leaving her jar by the well shows that she had made the decision to abandon the dead Wells of her life the wells that made her feel rejected isolated hopeless the wells that covered her with sin and shame so that she can begin to draw the Living Water that Jesus was offering in this very moment worship team you can come on up the woman at the well the one who was known for literally all the wrong things who drew from even the dirtiest of Wells understood that Jesus went out of his way to meet with her so that he can tell her that he wanted her murky water but not only that he wanted to offer her something better Living Water we see here that she began to abandon the dead wells in her life for The Living Water he was offering and what we find here is that she ran back to the very same Village that had outcasted her so that she can tell everybody about the Messiah the savior of the world she went into town and was probably like you know hey you guys won't believe who I just met with I think I found the Messiah and they probably were like all right go on you know they just want to see what she say maybe it's something they can use to keep making fun of her or talking about her and so she replies listen this man told me everything I did like everything you guys know about and he didn't run away and he didn't judge me and and he he didn't say anything about him he actually offered me something this thing that he calls Living Water you gotta see who I'm talking about and when the people heard this they were like there's no way somebody went to this woman didn't run so they were like I gotta see who this weirdo is for myself right like that's that's probably what their reaction was but look what the scripture says many Samaritans from the village believed in Jesus because of what the woman had said because a woman said he told me everything I ever did when they came out to see him They begged him to stay in their Village so he stayed for two days long enough for many more to hear his message and believe then they said to the woman now we believe not just because of what you told us but because we have heard him ourselves now we know that he is indeed the savior of the world this woman allowed Jesus to work in her in the nastiest parts of her and as a response because she allowed God to work in her God was able to work through her you see Jesus said two things about living water that those who drink from it will never grow thirsty again but he also says that it becomes a fresh bubbling spring within us a bubbling spring isn't just still water that just flows in the direction that it wants it's not something that can just be contained within itself it needs to birth it needs somewhere to go it needs to to go out The Living Water she received within her couldn't just stay contained within her it had to begin to flow through her and she went to her Village to testify about what Jesus had done as that Living Water began to flow through her and many in the village believed because of what the woman had said she pretty much becomes like the very first evangelist at this point the woman who drew from the wells of rejection isolation hopelessness and sin and shame God now made her a well but a well of Hope and a well of healing for the people around her and just like this woman when you allow Jesus to do the work in you when you when you give him that water of yours when you take the Living Water he has to offer when you allow him to work in you you open up the opportunity for him to begin to work through you when we receive this living water it's not just something that's supposed to stay in his church it's a bubbling spring that has to flow through us it needs to change the way you talk it needs to change the way you walk it needs to change the way you act like this it needs to be a thing that you walk into a room and they're like something's off with you that's what happened with this woman because just like this woman when you allow God to take your water when you accept the Living Water that he's offering in and you allow the water to flow through you you now have a story to tell just like this woman you have a work to do just like this woman you can't just let the work of Jesus stay in you you have to go back to your villages to tell people what Jesus has done for you because when you have the Living Water you now become a well a well of Hope for a world that has a deep longing and a deep thirst that only the Holy Spirit can quench Let's Dance so what wells do you find yourself drawing from this morning when you look at the water that you're carrying what's its condition is it monkey is it yucky is it gross no matter what your answer looks like today I want you to know that Jesus wants your water he wants all of you all that you have to offer even if it's just messiness this is what he came here on Earth to do to cleanse us of our sin you don't have to wait till you have it all figured out you don't have to wait till you look to clean as you can be Jesus wants to meet with you right here right now right with where you're at and he wants whatever it is that you have to offer he you watch your living water so that he can give you something better or you want your regular water so you can give you something better his living water that comes from the holy spirit that water that never runs out the only water that can truly quench The Thirst of our souls but in order for you to draw from that in order for you to let that flow through you you have to leave those dead wells in your life behind just because they're present doesn't mean you have to draw from them but get ready because this living water can't stay contained within your church God is calling you to a life bigger than just yourself he's not only looking to work in us but he's also looking to work through us and he is asking us to be a well of Hope for a thirsty world so as we sing this last song there's a couple of people I want to invite up here to the altar if you're in this room and you're still carrying that muddy water Jesus is asking you for it know that he's prepared a way for you to have relationship with him he's prepared a way for you to make that Exchange if that is you I just invite you to come up to these altars to give Jesus your water and make the decision to accept them into your life and to follow him if you're in this room and you've been searching all of the wrong Wells for God's living water and wants to make the decision today to abandon the dead walls of your life or the living water that can only come from the Holy Spirit come up to these altars and make that decision too as a sign of leaving your bucket by those dead well saying I'm done with that Holy Spirit I want what you have for me and if you're in this room and you've been trying to keep that living water in your life contained know that God wants to use you he wants you to become a well for the world around me so you too come to the altar today and seek from God if you've been keeping that water contained because he's not just trying to do a work in you he's trying to do a work through you so as we sing this last song you can just come on foreign [Music]", "[Music] thank you Jesus happy Sunday everybody Sunday so glad and privileged to bring God's message for you today but before we do I just want to say it's so good to see everybody how you guys doing today all right we're going to jump into uh the word of God very quickly here but I just hope that you all had a great Fourth of July and uh I want to invite you to do something with me today as we get into the message just allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you allow God to uh speak to your heart to your mind uh and I believe that today's word will be an encouragement for you today so we're in the middle of a message series titled the Finger of God tell your neighbor the Finger of God the Finger of God okay so uh the series highlights moments throughout scripture where the Finger of God Appears and we've already identified a pattern that whenever the Finger of God shows up it displays the power and authority of God that uh lesser spiritual powers of Darkness are confronted and ultimately it leads to captives being set free you see the Finger of God captives are being set free and uh a few years ago I was visiting my family in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and there's a mountain that called a Grandfather Mountain a tourist attraction with a mile high bridge and a small zoo near the top and the animals are local Wildlife Bears Bobcats got your Eagles your otter those those kinds of animals and so we go to the zoo and what we happened to arrive right as one of the zookeepers was about to do a presentation on black bears now the Bears happen to be uh in a pit surrounded by a large fence on the side of the mountain and as we waited for the presentation that we look down at the Bears and it's exactly what you would expect just a family of bears hanging out one of the Bears is sleeping in the cave one of them is rolling around scratching himself another one is sniffing around aimlessly and another one is making weird noises and it's kind of hard to know what what's going on what they're up to and um to me you know they just look like lazy uh dumb brutes uh that could also kill me right and uh uh but then the presentation began and at this point you know the Zookeeper who was evidently uh born to be a zookeeper and been waiting for this moment all of his life jumps out and uh he goes into this 15minute presentations on the ways of the bear he wants you to know everything there is about bears he tells us what the bears' names were and what these Bears individual personalities were he talks about bear hierarchies and their day-to-day interactions and mate selection process talks about their favorite foods and how you could how they could detect scents from over a mile away and how you could avoid bear attacks when you are camping and how fast they can run how fast they can climb and on and on and on about bears and towards the the end the guy started making loud bear noises calling the Bears to lunch apparently he spoke bear who knew right and uh but my point is uh I thought these were just dumb Bears scratching themselves but there was an entire substructure of bare communication and hyperintelligence I was completely unaware of and when the Zookeeper arrived he helped us us in the crowd to understand what what was before just unintelligible he helped us understand and much like the bare Kingdom right sometimes the kingdom of God is hard to understand how many can say Amen to that right sometimes it's hard uh because sometimes the way God works is a bit weird to our natural senses and because the ways of God are not always clear uh we require some help uh somebody say help to bring insight to what God is doing amen so today today we're looking at the life of Daniel and how he played a pivotal role in helping his generation understand what God was up to what he was doing and how can we uh aim to be people who help others understand the ways of God also so uh Daniel chapter 5 many years later King NE King Bazar uh gave a great feast for a thousand of his Nobles and he drank wine with them while Bazar was drinking the wine he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups that his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem he wanted to drink from them with his Nobles his wives and his concubines so they brought these gold cups taken from the temple the house of God in Jerusalem and the King and his Nobles his wives and his concubines drank from them while they drank from them they praised their Idols made of gold silver bronze iron wood and Stone suddenly Watch What Happens they saw the fingers of a human hand writing on the plaster wall of the king's Palace near the lampstand the king himself saw the hand as it wrote and his face turned pale with fright his knees knocked together in fear and his legs gave way beneath him now this is not a scene from The Adams Family happening right here you know this is not Stevie Wonder You know very superstitious writings on the wall this is none of that this is the Finger of God this is the hand of God and as the story continues King Bazar is unable to understand this writing on the wall which is where that that saying comes from it actually comes from the Bible if you didn't know that uh finally after his top magicians enchanters astrologers and fortune tellers fail to decipher it Daniel is called in by the king and it's important to remember for the story that Daniel had been living in Babylon for about 50 years he had been brought captive uh he was brought captive to Babylon as a young man to work in the Royal Palace and from a young age he had grown up maintaining his faithfulness to the one true God in a foreign land with foreign gods and a foreign way of life this means Daniel had to keep himself clean in a culture that was entirely Godless have you noticed lately that we live in a Godless culture can I get an amen and have you noticed how hard it is to not fall into captivity in a Godless culture it's very hard and so Galatians 51 actually encourages us it says so Christ has truly set us free now make sure that you stay free so getting free is only part of the equation but making sure that we stay free is another thing which can be challenging for we the people of Faith now today very quickly I just want to highlight three things three things from the life of Daniel that we can learn as we stay free in a Godless culture and so we're going to jump right in this is the first one staying free in a Godless culture how do you do that how do you stay free in a Godless culture well the first thing I want to highlight for you in this story is the importance of staying away from places of Darkness this seems like it should be obvious but it's not you know stay staying away from places of Darkness or places of C captivity the Bible calls it uh being wise which means you know that there are places where you should stay away from right you you should stay away now notice in the the opening party scene there's a party going on and the Bible is really trying to keep things PG for us but this is really an orgy what's happening here there's all kinds of debauchery and um but notice who isn't at the party Daniel is not at the party and we know this because he's later uh summoned to come and by the king himself to interpret the mysterious writing now this is significant for many reasons not least because Daniel was the type of influential figure in Babylonian life who could have had access to the king if he really wanted like if he really wanted to be at that party he he he knew the right people to call right to make that phone call but we also see that in earlier chapters under another uh previous King we know that when Daniel was young he and his friends had refused to eat from the king's table because you know food was very uh connected to spiritual uh and sexual debauchery just like uh just like at this party but when he was young Daniel and his friends refused to eat from the king's table even though they were in a place of privilege because they did not not want to defile themselves and so Daniel teaches us that in order to live in Freedom and in order to be light we have to live our lives counter culturally all the time whatever the culture is doing we we have to swim the other way Upstream right sometimes that can be hard and that's why we need one another but it's it's difficult to be light in the darkness when we ourselves are living in darkness when we ourselves are caught up in darkness it's hard to influence people a lot of of times people want to influence other people but they themselves are still in darkness so that that doesn't work and watch uh the the the Bible actually gives us wisdom for this in Proverbs 1:17 it says if a bird sees a trap being set it knows to stay away amen sometimes you just got to stay away right but these people set an ambush for themselves they are trying to get themselves killed such is the fate of all who are greedy for money it robs them of life wow so the truth is that there are places and people somebody say places and people right that will never lead us to a place of freedom and God calls us to be wise like birds and stay away from the devil's traps staying free in a Godless culture also requires us to intentionally pursue a life of sober mindedness somebody say Sober Sober I like that word sober now I want to tell you an interesting story it says this uh earlier um this is something that happened to me earlier this year there was a week when uh I had a mild fever and you know my nose was runny and I kept sneezing and just felt awful for several days and uh when Sunday morning came around and I was feeling better but not completely recovered uh I took some medication right before coming to the church uh unfortunately I had not read the label correctly right uh instead of taking The non-d Drowsy medication I took the The Drowsy medication and that was one of the worst Sundays of my life and I I was so sleepy the entire morning and it took me a while to figure out why and uh all I could think about was uh being back in bed I'm sure some of you can relate right um but and I'm sorry if you approached me in deep conversation that morning because I don't remember anything uh I felt that I was you know in a dream like when you're fighting but you feel like you're underwater uh I I don't remember how I made it through those services but I I went straight home and took a long nap but here's my point it it's hard to do what you want to do when external forces are fighting against you which is why pursuing sober mindedness is so important in fact first Peter 5'8 says this be sober minded Be watchful your adversary the devil prows around like a roaring lion lion seeking someone to devour so now watch this watch Bazar so instead of being sober minded King Bazar does the opposite by numbing his senses to reality he wants to numb his senses to reality and he is drunk on Pleasure power and pride and this leads him to the defy the one true God by using the sacred cups of God's house to drink and praise His false gods this is not good and so this is interesting because history tells us that that very night that very moment the party was happening his enemies the mes and the Persians were outside standing uh surrounding the city ready to attack and we know the exact date it's 539 BC this is actual a historic moment uh that that that took place that was real and that was the beginning of the the mes and the Persians Empire but Bel Bazar is in trouble his kingdom was crumbling and rather than being the leader his people needed he led them into debauchery right so in contrast Daniel stands as an example for us of what it means to be a Godly influence in the midst of a Godless culture so that's the first thing let's second thing is this the value here we see the value of remembering your assignment tell your neighbor remember your assignment ass as mentioned before it's been several decades since Daniel arrived to the land of babyon and uh early on he had become a powerful figure in the nation's spiritual and political life and as a Young Man Daniel and a group of his friends had stood for righteousness even under the threat of death but now after several administrations he was an old man and you could say that his Glory Days were behind him but nothing could be further from the truth you see when Daniel is summoned by the king to read the mysterious writing on the wall it is amazing to see that Daniel is still Faithfully following the ways of God Amen we see this in Daniel in the chapter verse 16 it says the king speaking to Daniel I am told that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems if you can read these words and tell me their meaning you will be clothed in purple Robes of Royal honor and you will have a gold chain placed around your neck you will become the third highest ruler in the Kingdom now watch what Daniel responds Daniel answered the king keep your gifts or give them to someone else but I will tell you what the writing means Hallelujah so we see that Daniel remembers what his assignment is and he's still faithful it's still the same Daniel many years later full of Faith set apart following the ways of God and standing up for righteousness still sober minded not allowing himself to get wrapped up in the glitz and the glamour of the palace or The Lure of power can I just make a a parenthesis here and speak for a moment to the older uh Believers in the room maybe some watching us online if you have been following Jesus for a long long time like decades or if you have been following Jesus most of your life your spiritual walk matters more than you know your spiritual walk matters because there is something powerful about a person who has been walking with Jesus for a long long time and I've had the privilege in my lifetime of meeting many older Believers people of God many of of whom are in this room and it is absolutely lifegiving to find older saints of God that inspire you to love Jesus more than you did before that that's something rare to find and with all my heart I believe that we need more examples of longevity and godliness in our lives we would all be better for it and perhaps you are listening today and you have been underestimating your role in God's kingdom but watch what the Apostle Paul tells uh a younger Minister Titus and he's he's telling them how he ought to live and teach and how he he should teach the older Believers in his faith community uh to live and this is what it says in Titus 2:6 in the same way encourage the young men to live wisely and you yourselves must be an example to them by doing good works of every kind let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching so here the Apostle Paul highlights one of the essential roles of older wiser mature Believers within the faith community of God they are to encourage the younger Believers and they are to be an example to the younger Believers this is why it is so important that we uh that as we follow Jesus we continue to aim towards greater maturity that we continue to grow that we continue to learn because there are others that are following behind us now many years later we find that Daniel is still being faithful to his assignment he's still holding the standard he's still being the man of God and it's just awesome to see that it's awesome to see that when Daniel finally gets a chance to interpret the writing on the wall this is what he tells the king in verse 23 he's very bold and very cautious he says you have proudly defied the Lord of Heaven and have had these cups from his Temple brought before you you and your Nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver gold bronze iron wood and stone gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all but you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny so God has sent this hand to write this message this is the message that was written many many Teel and Parson this is what the words mean man means numbered God has numbered the days of your Reign and has brought it to an end Teel means weighed you have been weighed on the balances and have not measured up and Parson which means divided your kingdom has been divided and given to the mes and the Persians then at baltazar's command Daniel was dressed in purple robes a gold chain was hung around his neck and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the Kingdom which is like kind of being handed the best seat on the Titanic right cuz it's going under like it means nothing right but verse 30 that very night Bazar the Babylonian King was killed so here we see the Judgment of God which is a common theme when the Finger of God Appears this was a a message that was written as a sign of judgment against the King and we we've seen now how when the Finger of God shows up in scripture God is taking upon himself the right to judge the people in powers that are perpetuating Injustice what God wrote on the wall was something like this belzar you have been measured on God's scales and you've come up short God has judged you and you are unfit to be king your kingdom is done and by the way can I just uh tell you this if you are Bel chazar in this moment this is the point of the story where you get on your knees and you cry out to God where you get on your knees and you cry out to God I I am it baffles me how when people are in trouble I mean I mean their lives are falling apart they refuse to cry out to God and I'm thinking to myself this is the moment this is the moment where you cry out for God's mercy because God wants to extend his Mercy but not Bazar there is no repentance No Remorse on his on his behalf and he's actually more concerned about his reputation and and saving face in the middle of this spiritual spanking that he's getting right uh I want to ask you a question today if God was uh to weigh your life today on his scales and he is but imagine if you could see that what would he find if God were to weigh your life on his scale the truth is that we would all fall short because Psalm 130 says this Lord if you kept the record of our sins who oh Lord could ever survive but you offer forgiveness that we might learn to fear you so there's the Judgment of God when the Finger of God Appears but then there's also mercy and as harsh as the message of impending doom was for King Bazar to hear and as harsh as the Judgment of God may seem to us as the readers the Finger of God was also simultaneously extending Mercy that might be hard for us to understand because we cannot imagine those two things being compatible with one another like we often think of justice as being completely void of Mercy which is not real Justice and we often think of Mercy as as forgoing judgment which is not real Mercy but it it seems from the scriptures that God is a able to do both and you might ask yourself well Pastor Dave how can you tell that God is extending Mercy to Bel chazar and for that it requires a basic understanding of the ways of God look at uh 2 Peter 3:9 where it says this about God's heart and God's character it says the Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness instead he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repent repentance amen so God does not want anyone to perish that is the heart of God he's patient with us he wants us to turn to him and so God has a track record of this in scripture you will recall uh the nation of the nvite The ninevites Who repent at the you know the kind of forced preaching of Jonah he doesn't want to preach to them but he finally obeys and and and they all repent immediately and God stops the dest ruction that was coming their way or how about King Hezekiah who who was sick he he he he fell sick with a a deadly sickness but he cried out to God he cried out to God in that moment and and God heard his prayer and he gave him 15 more years to live or how about Nebuchadnezzar the the predecessor of of King uh Bazar he was driven into madness to act like an animal he was ridiculed he was humbled by God but then when he cried out to God and he recognized that there is only one true God he was restored to his kingdom and so this was a moment for belzar to repent to turn back to God but he rejects the opportunity to repent lastly the last thing that we're going to look at today is that God desires for his ways to be known now something that we've been doing lately uh we're really excited excited about kicking back uh the van Ministry some of you will remember that uh before the pandemic we had a solid Transportation Ministry and then you know the world happened and then uh We've now bought a new a new van and so uh I've been kind of trying to sort out the paperwork registration and and by the way if you want to be part of the van Ministry you can sign up on the church Center app you can do that um but anyways I've been trying to sort out this paperwork and there's a question that I need to answered it's a very specific question and without this thing I cannot move forward it's very small but I want to talk to a human right and so I call the RMV right so you know where I'm going with this I call the RMV and uh you know after hours of waiting on the phone it Dawns on me what should have been obvious the entire time and that's that the RMV the obstacles right that are in the way are intentional they don't want you talking to a human they want you talking to their robot right they want you talking to the machine and so it's very frustrating because I'm trying to figure out what to do and it's impossible thankfully God is not like that God desires for his ways to be known as we look back on this story something that might not be obvious at first is that the Finger of God doesn't just provide the message the Finger of God also provides the man of God to translate the message so that those people in captivity can understand that there is re real Freedom available for them so you see it's not given that people will simply know God like Jonah at first Daniel could have run away and refuse to translate the writing right he's got judgment coming to him might as well let him have it right but he translates it and you know in the book of Isaiah we find another moment when God has become frustrated at with the stubbornness of his people he predicts a time of of captivity ahead and where there will be they will be conquered the people of God will be conquered by Foreign Nations and the sign of his judgment is that they will be uh spoken to in an unknown Language by these foreigners look at Isaiah 2811 it says so now God will have to speak to his people because they're so rebellious through foreign oppressors who will speak a strange language God has told his people here is a place of rest let the weary rest here this is a this is a a place of quiet rest but they would not listen so as a rule of thumb generally in the Bible when someone speaks in an unknown language without interpretation that's not a good thing that is not a good thing and so you will remember the story of the Tower of Babel where God confuses the languages of the the people so they can't understand one another and this instance here where Bazar sees this writing but he can't understand what it is as the worship team comes up it seems that there is a shift H that takes place after the life of Jesus you see in the book of Acts the story of the early church the spirit of God causes 120 people gathered for prayer to speak in languages that they had never learned before these are country people they've never traveled that far and so they start speaking in languages they had never learned before and that was on the day of Pentecost this was a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit as a result the gathered nations of the world at the time they were gathered in Jerusalem had the opportunity to hear from these Believers The Works of God in a language that they could understand later when Peter explains to the stunned onlookers what is happening he quotes the prophet Joel saying that this was a promise God had made long ago back in um in Joel he's quoting here in Acts 2 it says in the last days God says I will pour out my spirit upon all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams in those days I will will pour out my spirit even on my servants men and women alike and they will prophesy Joel prophesied of a time when men and women The Young and the old the free and the slaves would be able to understand clearly the ways of God the death and resurrection of Jesus and his Ascension to Heaven had marked the beginning of a new era and God had poured out his holy spirit upon on the church and on that day the day of Pentecost Peter preached and 3,000 people were added to the church and friends that promise is still available for us today when we surrender Our Lives to the kingship of Jesus it is clear from the Finger of God and the writing on the wall that God wants us to be people who help others understand the ways of God would you please stand with me [Music] today you just bow your head with me in a moment of [Music] reflection today we've heard of call to become people who show others the goodness of God 1 Peter 2:9 says but you are not like that meaning people of Disobedience it says for you are a chosen people you are royal priests a holy nation God's very own possession as a result you can show others the goodness of God for he called you out of Darkness into his wonderful light again let us be people who show others the goodness of God and I just want to end today with two questions to help us reflect In This Moment the first question is this are you someone who understands the ways of God I'm not talking about are you religious you know how many years have you been to church no I'm talking about your understanding of who God is on a personal level do you know the ways of God do you know the heart of God do you know God's purpose for your life if not God wants to make his ways known to you he really does and the second question is this are you someone who is helping others understand the ways of God you might ask yourself things like am I living in the light am I making myself available to help others understand the will of God and so today we're going to open up the altars and we'd love to pray for you the worship team will lead us in this last song and as they do I would encourage you to cry out to God to lift your hearts up to God and to say God I want to know your ways today thank you", "all right happy Jesus day everyone why to you look at your neighbor give him a high five or something like you made it you made it to Easter it's like a whole month early or something it's great great we're just going to I have a feeling that it might be a little bit Rowdy in here today um the first service was less Rowdy let's say um yeah yeah some of you shifted Services that's why the okay so we're going to jump right in one of the reasons that we have the Bible is to understand how God relates and connects to humanity and throughout the Bible we see one story after another of God making a way where there wasn't a way to be made of previously impossible situations now becoming entirely possible so just we're going to wrap rapid fire through a couple of them there's these three guys Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these are three Hebrew young men that were in a really tricky situation and the King wanted them to Bow Down and Worship Him and they refused to Bow Down and Worship the king so the king orders them in the on on the spot to be executed by being thrown into a fiery furnace but pre-incarnate Jesus shows up in the fire with the three Hebrew Hebrew children or three Hebrew young men and he protects them and the King then orders them out of the fire and on the spot he hires them to help him run the country and the King wants to now worship their God and it's just a really good reminder that when you're going through the fiery furnace moments of Life hang in there don't give up call out to God there's another lady named Ruth Ruth was a a Biblical hero that lost her husband in a famine she lost everything she had no home no hope but she remained faithful to God she worked hard she did not lower her standards and God in return gave her a brand new future am there's the notorious story of Jonah Jonah who was a prophet that was running from the call of God on his life and he ends up making like this big b spir big spiritual loser moment in his life and he ends up in the belly of a giant fish or a whale for a few days and that's an unfortunate moment and he had no hope death was the only certainty and after everything else had fallen apart Jonah calls out to God in the darkest moment and God rescues him and allows a whole other Nation to be rescued as a result today I want you to think carefully about the death burial and resurrection of of Jesus Christ and all of the implications of it for us today one of them is the clear sense that the death and resurrection of Jesus means it's not over when it always seems over amen you might be down today life might have kicked you into teeth two or three or 20 times but it's still not over if you're breathing God still has a plan for you yes there was a 75-year-old man named Abraham or Abram eventually becomes Abraham and God uh Abraham was given a promise by God in Genesis chapter 15 it says then the Lord took Abram outside and said to him look up into the sky and count the Stars if you can that's how many descendant you will have Abram I'm going to make you a father of many nations and so years go by and Abraham still believes even though he started at 75 and he's getting older he even once tried to figure it out on his own and he got off track and there were some ultimately devastating consequences and it's a good reminder that when God gives you a promise don't rush the promise of God don't take it into your own hands sometimes God's timing is different than our timing and yet in spite of some misunderstandings and some bad choices Abraham's faith in the promise of God kept him kept pulling him back it kept pulling him back so years go by many years go by and now he's 99 years old it was at that point I'm not trying to scare anybody over retirement age here but okay so it was at it was at that point when everybody else said there was no chance it was absolutely done deal over no natural means was available that Abraham and Sarah could have kids and then God said Now's the Time when all the other options were off the table God says Now's the Time in Genesis chapter 21 it says Sarah became pregnant and she gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age this happened at just the time somebody say just the time the time say just the time God had said it would just the time God said it would and Abraham named their son Isaac in this moment we see that when there is no earthly way and everybody else around has given up God can still show up when the whole world says there is no hope God says I am hope and hope is on the way when the situation of your life is dead and buried God says hey that's a great time to get started resurrections happen to be a specialty with God that's what Easter is all about Resurrection hope that Jesus conquered death and the grave and in then then stands and invites us into his kingdom Hallelujah in Romans chapter 4 it says even when there was no reason for Hope Abraham kept hoping believing that he would become the father of many nations for God had said to him that's how many descendants you will have and Abraham's Faith did not weaken even though at about a hundred years of age he figured his body was as good as dead and so was Sarah's womb Abraham never wavered in believing God's promise in fact his Faith grew stronger and in this he brought glory to God he was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises now Abraham just like us have we have to choose we have to choose are we only going to look at our circumstances are we only going to look at our situations are we only going to look at the things that are obviously right in front of us or will we like Abraham instead make sure to always look at who God is and God's faithfulness in our life and God's faithfulness in these situations it's that's a that's a tension that we live in the things we see and the things we know about God for Abraham his son Isaac was born at a 100 years of age what does that mean it means it's not over when it looks over and maybe today your promise that you're expecting from God hasn't quite shown up yet maybe your Isaac isn't here yet maybe it seems like all hope is lost maybe it's clear that there is no way out but with God's response to Abraham we see that it's not over even when it's too late even when it's not when it's clearly over it's not over with God hallu when there is no way out God can still carve a way out for you another thing I think of when I think of Easter and all that it symbolizes is that God isn't done with you yet no matter what you think perhaps you've come in here today and you are convinced that your life is over you've wasted all your chances you squandered too many opportunities you've gotten so far off track you can never make it back come on too many years have passed by I can't do anything now it's just not possible some time back I did some kind of morbid calculation about our church and I started calculating how much total time have people served in jail in our church on now and so I put the people that I know the I'm sure there's some I don't there's people that I know I'm like okay how many years they did how many years they did I got to over a thousand years when I gave up so I'm like yikes that's a lot of years then I was like let me take it a step further how many years have people in our church previously been an active addiction and I started calculating it I started getting discouraged after a thousand years I said I'm going to stop that's good enough for me to know I don't need to know anything else sometimes you sit down and you start to tell me your story and I say I don't need to know I don't need to know you and Jesus need to know I don't need to know thousands of years just people in our congregation have been locked up in jail or alcoholism or drug addiction or porn addiction or every other kind of addiction and then other people have wasted Decades of their life chasing after worthless trinkets that will make no difference in anyone's life which is just as much a waste it's easy to think to yourself I've blown it I've wasted too much time I give up God must be done with me but I want you to know that he is reminding us today that that's not true God is not done with you in fact God placed this Outpost of Hope East Coast International Church right here in downtown Lynn to let you know on Easter Sunday 2024 that the only fool in the house today is the devil and we're serving the devil eviction papers [Applause] today I want you to get this deep in your soul God has been chasing after you every second of your life yeah every second of your life because God is never going to be done with you God is not against you God doesn't hate you God is in fact for you and remember that's good news because God is the god of the impossible yes he is so when you are sick and tired of it all when the road has been too long and too lonely and you want to give up don't give up on God because he will never give up on you amen in the book of Philippians it says I am certain that God who began the good work within you will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns now listen I know some of you God's been working on a long time and I know he's got a lot of work left to do right but the promise is he's not going to stop working he's not going to stop working God has begun a good work in many of you and maybe you've gotten distracted maybe even made some poor choices but God's not done and God wants to finish what he started and he's reminding us all today he hasn't given up on any of you there's another man in the Bible named Joseph was a young man and he had a dream one evening and he was the youngest of he was he was he was a young man and he had these older brothers and he decides to tell his brothers the dream that someday he had a dream that he would do great things in his life and when he told his brothers his brothers turned out to be dream killers and they got really jealous and angry at him and so his brothers do something really traumatic they sell him into slavery yes I want you to see how his brothers made a choice that impacted Joseph's life like and it's true that even today the choices of other people can impact our life amen and not always in a good way and you might relate to Joseph on that level he was sold to Piper and God was good to Joseph and Joseph becomes in charge of Piper's house it looks like he's about to have a way out God's carving a way out for him and boom he's falsely accused of something and he's sent to prison but Joseph still doesn't give up on God and he's in prison and he doesn't give up on God and he's holding on to God and and in time God does something amazing and in one moment in one day God changes everything and moves Joseph from the prison to the Palace in just one day right now in one day his life literally goes from worst to first he was down and he was done for but in an instant God plucks him out of prison puts him into the palace in order to save the lives of millions and millions of people later on after like he's on the on the good side of this his brothers meet him again right and they realized it was their brother when he realized it was they were scared right they're scared and this is what Joseph responded while while they were terrified he says in Genesis 50:20 you meant to hurt me but God turned your evil into good to save the lives of many people which is being done hallelujah God turned your evil into good what now here here's the challenge for us when we refuse to give God the pains and injustices of our life of our past those pains and injustices can actually destroy us but when you take the Pains of your past and your present and you give them to God you hand them over to God he can use them to bring good into your life he can force those previously evil things to stand up and bless you instead that's it's a really difficult thing to get your head around that's what the story of Joseph is about he can literally turn the evil evv iil around so that you can live L IV all right [Applause] now another reflection on this Easter Sunday is that sometimes things have to die before there can be a resurrection the day Jesus was unjustly executed was on a Friday and we call it good Good Friday that is the day that Jesus gave up his own life so that we might be able to live before Jesus could be resurrected there first had to be a death and sometimes things in our life have to die before God can resurrect you there are things in your life that you must lay down and let go of before God can lift you up let go God so the question is what do you need to let go of today what do you need to lay down Romans chapter 5 says but God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still Sinners and since we have been made right in God's sight by the blood of Christ he will certainly save us from God's condemnation for since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his son while we were still his enemies we will certainly be saved through the life of his son so now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends with God hallelujah this is why Jesus had to die so that we might become friends with God in John chapter 19 it records the the final words of Jesus and Jesus says it is finished it's right before he dies it means that what he's saying is the debt has been paid like I took care of it a a a penalty you see a spiritual surcharge was attached to all of our Lives because of sin and Jesus Paid it for us because the cost was more than we could actually afford to pay amen see God made us he created us he had a plan for us but all of us have gone astr we've gone our own way God had a plan but so often we just choose our own plan instead and did our own thing there's this old expression you know do the crime do the time all right but these are crimes that we can't possibly pay the time for yes the cost is too great God knows it so Jesus steps in to do the time for us he takes our place the same Jesus tells a story tells a story about a son that decided he didn't want to follow his daddy's rules anymore never known that to ever happen before so so he left his family and he took his share of the family fortune he did what so many people do he simply did his own thing he squandered his wealth and his youth on wild living until the day came when the money ran out and the opportunities to bounce back weren't there I'm sure he thought to himself hey it's no big deal when the money runs out I'll just make some more when the ladies leave I'll just get some more when it stops being fun I will just make some more fun all right but the money ran out and no more could be made and when the ladies all left and no more were around and when the fun was over so was the game and in Luke 15:1 17 Jesus is telling the story he says the young man finally came to his senses these are really powerful words right here amen and I really think that God brings everybody to this moment where you have a chance to come to your senses or not amen amen yes he realized in this moment when he came to his senses that he had betrayed his family and wasted all the good things that he had been given so he went back he went home to his father father to beg for mercy but he didn't have to beg for mercy because his father was already waiting for him his father saw him in the distance and ran to meet him and welcomed him back not as a servant not as a blacklisted child but as a child who was fully restored back into the Family the son watch this the son had to die to himself so he could be raised back up as something greater all right now the worship team can come on up now to this very day Jesus Christ stands waiting With Arms Wide Open for each and every one of us amen he still stands inviting us With Arms Wide Open so the questions are our questions like this what will you do about that will you walk away from that or will you accept his invitation will you lay it all down and run to Jesus will you receive his forgiveness will you receive his leadership that's the questions that we wrestle with today would you stand with me as we close in just a moment the worship team will lead us but let me ask you this question the core of it today is this is it time is it time for you to come back to Jesus yes it is it time for you to die to yourself like the sun had to is it time for you to lay it down to give it up to let go and let God is it time I would say that it's always the time time but specifically it's very clearly your time right now Easter 2024 as the worship team leads us if if you'd like to say to God God it is my time to come back to you it's my time to to lay it down it's my time to die to myself it's my time to receive your forgiveness and your leadership it's my time to turn it all over to you then before you leave this place today you invite Jesus you accept the invitation of Jesus invite him to forgive you of your sins invite him to lead your life for those of you that would like to this altar or this stage up here that we call an altar it's a place for you to come and kneel and pray and just say to God the things that you need to say things that only you and God can talk about Hallelujah so let's take some time now to respond to reflect and just connect with God is it your time", "[Applause] Beth sheepa that's awesome awesome jumping right in today uh we're in our let's go Series going through the book of Acts uh continuing the mission of Jesus today we're traveling over to the city of Corinth in the ancient Greco Roman world it was a significant city the city of Corinth it was a center of global Commerce and trade it was not as Elite as Rome and it wasn't as intellectual as Athens where was last week I was uh in fact what's happening in Corinth is Corinth is loaded with Sailors and Merchants and Traders and people from all over the world that are trying to make a dollar the geography of this region is what made it such a popular city because it was this this ismith if that's how you say it it's a very narrow strip of land and what would happen was that ships would choose to go into Corinth and either have their ship pulled along the the uh they had a like a track and they could pull their ships over to the other body of water or they could unload their ships and have a ship on the other side they did this because going around the the land was very very dangerous particularly at that time and so it they were avoiding shipwrecks and very costly mistakes and it could save them time as well so this is what would happen as a result you had all these sailors and all these merchants on the land in Corinth it was also a center of worship it was a center of worship to ancient pagan gods and goddesses there was lots of Temple prostitution that's what they called it in in the books but we would really more accurately today in pop culture call it human trafficking or exploitation specifically occurring at the Temple of Aphrodite there's a picture of this temple in Corinth the Ancient Temple on your screen this was the commonly accepted practice somebody say commonly accepted AC I want you think about those two words the commonly accepted the it was the commonly accepted practice 2,000 years ago uh but that does not just because something's commonly accepted does not mean that everybody likes it and it is especially not liked or valued by the poor this was entire irely exploitive this Temple prostitution and the people in charge were the powerful and the rich at the same time that this was happening in Corinth there was the serious persecution of the Jews in in Rome and if you know your history at all you will know that from from the very beginning with Jews the enemy has been trying to destroy all Jews and it's been throughout history and so in the city of Rome the Jews were expelled and deported and Jews uh fled the country of Italy they fled Rome to go to safer places so there was this couple this Jewish couple named Priscilla and Aquilla who were Jews that fled Rome and set up a tent making business in Corinth that's important because people needed tents and this was their trade and so this is how they made their income now just to set the scene correctly Priscilla and Aquilla were also Jews that had been with Jesus in person let's say 20 years before they had experienced the life and teaching and Ministry of Jesus the that they mourned the death of Jesus they celebrated his resurrection from the dead they understood Jesus to be the Messiah The Chosen One Emanuel God With Us Aquilla Aquilla is also understood to have been one of the 72 people that Jesus sent out on short-term missions when Jesus was walking with them and so they would go off declaring the good news and Healing The Sick and casting out demons and inviting the anybody who desired to come and meet Jesus because Jesus was unlike anyone they had ever known they had become fully convinced that Jesus was in fact this long- awaited Messiah and that Jesus presence signaled the inauguration of the greatest Rescue Mission in history so here they are Priscilla and Aquilla lots of stuff has changed since that time it's 20 years later in Corinth and Paul shows up so who's Paul Paul is the same guy that we talked about last week in Athens uh this is the same Paul that once sought out and persecuted and murdered the followers of Jesus but after that time Paul had become convinced fully convinced that Jesus was exactly who he said he was and he is now on a mission to do the mission of Jesus wherever he can go in Acts 18:1 it says this then Paul left Athens and went to Corinth there he became acquainted with a Jew named Aquilla born in pontis which is Northern turkey who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla they had left Italy when Claudius Caesar deported all the Jews from Rome Paul lived and worked with them for they were tent makers just as he was so here they are they just met and now they're like a family unit they're working together they're living together now that doesn't always happen here in the United States right right so today we're going to talk a little bit about something called Supernatural Community why don't you tell your neighbor Supernatural community so that sounds creepy maybe to some of you but to others you might understand what I'm talking about there is a theme that emerges throughout the Bible about coming together about being in unity about finding community and doing life together Ecclesiastes chapter 4 gives us some wisdom and says a person standing alone can be attacked and defeated but two can stand back to back and Conquer they are even three are even better for a triple braided cord is not easily broken 1 2 3 you get the idea we're we're we're joining forces we even have a song here in America that uh has been redone by dozens and dozens of artists it is a pop uh popular song that uh has a theme around this and so see if you can tell what this song is but don't Shout It Out Loud okay just go ahead and play this go ahead and play this [Music] [Applause] don't say it out loud don't say it out loud don't say it out loud I'll ask you in a second this is how I would play it if I were [Music] playing all right come hold on now don't say it out loud don't say it out loud I'm going to ask this is just me for for fun okay how many of you in the room have no idea what song that is raise your hand oh man wow wow wow no no keep it up keep up the hands we got to all the old-timers look around please okay look around okay it's not everybody kept their hand up that time yeah okay okay that's a that's a demographic thing right there okay so everybody over 30 on the count of three say the name of the song out loud 1 2 3 come together okay The Beatles originally did that song Come Together that was Gary Gary Clark's uh remake of that song you know it may be one of the most popular songs in history but that's okay for those of you that didn't know it that's okay but this song it was just kind of a fun song back when the hippies were all around right so you know this come together idea now chances are you've heard or maybe don't realize you heard some version of that song those two words come together are some of the most powerful words that could produce impact in our world today the words come together you see when all the forces in our society are trying to separate us and divide us you have to pause and ask yourself why why are we constantly being divided on purpose you see when when people come together those two powerful words and when people actually do it it produces impact around the world people are trying or entities are trying to divide us for their own profit or their own gain there is cash to be made in dividing people lots of it to me this has an echo a historic Echo it has an echo of Ancient Temple prostitution creating division though is the new game because it exploits the poor and it and most people don't particularly like the system but it seems to be the only system there is so people just go along with it that's why when people start coming together it can create fear in the hearts of exploiters that's your there's your little conspiracy theory idea for the morning right there okay the no but when we come together it's powerful and people are are afraid so in the acts 18 passage Paul shows up and he's embraced he's embraced by them and he's invited into their lives verse three says Paul lived and worked with them for they were tent makers just as he was like we talked about already this is not a normal experience for most of humanity just to meet somebody and say hey let's partner together for life let's go this is a unique and Powerful expression of Christian Hospitality to become fully embraced by another because you are on the same team now although they did not have a previous relationship they were family because they shared a common savior they shared a common hope they were interconnected in the deepest of spiritual ways they were in fact spiritual family and if you don't understand the idea of spiritual family you won't understand how in the world did Paul just like move in Romans 8:17 says this and since we are his meaning God's since we are God's children we are his heirs what that means is that everyone that chooses Jesus becomes part of the family of God and that means that we all that choose Jesus become brothers and sisters of one another now you're like really that's my sister that's my brother can I get a different family please listen this little country church that I grew up in took this seriously we referred to everybody as brother and sister it was a comforting reality to recognize that brother price the 75-year-old coal miner with three fingers missing from three separate coal mining accidents with a deep and sincere and faithful commitment to Christ was not only my Elder he was also my brother he taught me how to mix cement and lay bricks and Hammer nails and he taught me how to praise God during the good time times and during the bad times he taught it all he taught me that no matter how successful one gets the only treasure worth saving was the treasure stored up in heaven he had personally experienced great forgiveness and offered it freely as well I was 15 he was 60 years older than me but he was my older brother and took that responsibility seriously to authentic followers of Jesus there can be a deep and abiding sense of family Paul found this with Priscilla and Aquilla they had a common Savior and they were brothers and sisters they also and this is important they also shared a common Mission a common Savior and a common mission for the next 3 years approximately Paul worked alongside of Priscilla and Aquilla not just making tents not just making money but they are together subversively tearing down the Demonic strongholds in Corinth they continued with the mission of Jesus they preached good news to the poor healed the sick freed the captives contended for justice for the oppressed and then during after the season was over and the church in Corinth is established after three years they Paul then leaves and he moves on to the next place but in verse 18 it says this then he meaning Paul set for Syria taking Priscilla and Aquilla with him now don't miss this it wasn't just that Priscilla and Aquilla were hospitable he wasn't like just taking the chefs along for the ride they were on the same exact mission that Paul was on Amen they were missionally connected in fact they're on the same exact mission that the entire book of Acts is about which is this is how you continue the mission of Jesus in the middle of this this couple Hears A Man Named Apollos not Paul but Apollos preaching and they they recognize that he he's good he's he's on the same team he's one of them but he's missing a couple of important facts and details verse 26 when Priscilla and aquil Aquilla heard him preaching boldly in the synagogue they took him aside and explain the way of God even more accurately so although Apollo's had most of the idea he was missing a few pieces and so this couple comes alongside and they Mentor Apollos they get him up to speed here's what they don't do they don't like uh blast him on Instagram they don't make a YouTube video about him and they don't start a cancel campaign about Apollo missing the de missing the story not getting it quite right what they did did was they saw God's hand on his life and then came alongside of him privately and gave him further instruction and the rest of the story that he didn't have he was coming at it from a place of ignorance not a place of Scandal the Apostle Paul the the Apostle Paul's of History are always going to get the accolades listen carefully to this some of you might be a Paul and some of you are priscillas and aquilas whatever it is that you are remember this the Pauls will always get the credit they'll always get the accolades but in reality the priscillas and aquilas are the ones that allow the paws of the faith to lead they are doing their part Paul is doing his part they're all doing what God has gifted them to do but one without the other fails so when when we all get to heaven and the crowns and the the the jewels and the crowns are are handed out or however that's going to work Priscilla and agilla are going to have a lot just like Paul so Paul who was frequently described in lots of list of historic list as either the first or second most influential person in history he can only be Paul because of Priscilla and Aquilla inside of that idea is this idea of common Mission and on the idea of Comm mission is the idea of being on the same team of not doing it alone initially it's their Hospitality that made them Heroes but here we have a couple of a couple that does not appear they don't appear by any understanding to be great public speakers or dynamic and charismatic leaders but they were Heroes of hospitality and had a pure and deep knowledge of Jesus and his transformative power in the lives of those who submit themselves to his purposes they brought truth and wisdom and love to other people without them it doesn't happen the same way the book of Acts doesn't quite play out Corinthians doesn't get written the story desperately changes you know we can see this throughout Christian history in the 1700s here in the United States there was a great Revival was called in history they call it a Great Awakening and the main leader of it was a guy named John Wesley John Wesley went through uh America it it it it changed the course of America for for many many people it was a fascinating time but and today the wesleyian movement the Methodist movement uh uh the am movement all of all all of these even the movement that we're part of have a line goes back to these wesleyian Traditions or these things that took place in the 1700s it's a big deal but the guy you don't hear about is a is a that really is the one responsible for making that all happen is a guy named Francis Asbury Francis Asbury if you're from the region you might have heard of something called Asbury Grove it's named after Francis Asbury Francis Asbury is like the number two guy in the great Awakenings he's the guy that John Wesley would go out and make a big mess of stuff and it was awesome like an awesome beautiful mess and Francis Asbury would come along and organize it and get it all set up Francis Asbury actually lived in Lynn for a long time um and uh it is a fascinating idea that the significant movement of God in the 1700s in the United States actually doesn't happen the same way without a guy that almost nobody knows about Francis Asbury he's like that Priscilla Aquilla he he he just he had a different gift set and he used that gift set to accomplish God's purposes now we're going to shift gears here a little bit I want you to think about in your life um what happens when things don't turn out the way you had hoped see Priscilla and Aquilla thrived in their life with love and purpose generosity and Mission and if you only know pieces of their story you might miss the fact that these are Overcomers that these were people that were living had experienced and were living through the middle of a great Injustice in their life their life had been disrupted as all the Jews were kicked out of Rome they were displaced in the most unjust type of way and I will tell you this is not what they thought was going to happen with their life when they're in Rome setting up their business and doing life and and loving life and loving each other other they weren't thinking hey we want a summer Cottage in Corinth this is not part of their plan this is not what they had planned for their life it's not where they were heading it's very different this story is really an example of a couple that's going full steam ahead and suddenly life takes a quick left-hand turn that they were not planning on taking they never wanted it they never planned for it it's not what was supposed to happen but when that happens to to us and it happens to us how how is it that you thrive in those unexpected moments or those unexpected left-hand turns especially when those things are unjust in the first book in the Bible Genesis we have an account of a ma of a man named Joseph who was sold into slavery by his brothers there was some family dysfunction there it's a tough story to read it really is his older brothers who are supposed to protect him and care for him sell him into slavery but eventually Joseph is elevated in this place of slavery he is elevated to a position of leadership in Egypt and his elevated position allows him to save millions and millions of lives Joseph's brother Joseph's brothers eventually have to come to Egypt to try to buy some food during the Great Famine and now here they are face to face with the brother they sold into slavery all right if this were a Hollywood movie those guys are dead in about 3 seconds right it's just all over for those guys they fear for their lives as they meet their brother who they had no idea what had happened to since that time and now he's a powerful man but Joseph calms them down and he says this and this is an important spiritual principle don't you see you planned evil against me but God used those same plans for my good am don't you see you plan evil against me but God used those same plans for my good that is a powerful and important principle for us as Christ followers whatever the world has planned whatever the enemy has planned whatever those left-hand turns are whatever that Injustice is whatever those unexpected moments are they are certainly intended for evil against you but God has a powerful way of taking those things and spinning them around he's a powerful way of then making a way where there seems to be no way here we have a couple Priscilla and Aquilla that instead of giving up they immediately put to use their gifts and talents in an unfamiliar place place where they didn't want to be but they allow God to use them they allow God to use them to be a source of strength and encouragement and support to Paul and to the establishment of the early church across the Greco Roman World in spite of the persecution that they had faced in spite of the injustices that had occurred to them in spite of the financial losses they had suffered they were on a more important Mission they obviously understood that this Earth in deep inside of them they understood this this Earth was not really their home they're just passing through they must have lived with a complete confidence that the God of all gods the king of all Kings would one day exert Justice and that God would indeed fight their battles on their behalf when you live with that kind of inner confidence inner recognition of that God is for you not against you that he authentically is going to do things with you it changes how you handle stuff so as the uh worship team comes up I want to challenge you with this I want to challenge you today if you're a Priscilla or an Aquilla don't just do life alone if you're a Paul don't do life alone Ecclesiastes 4 says two people are better off than one for they can help each other succeed if one person Falls the other can reach out and help but someone who falls alone is in real trouble likewise two people lying close together can keep each other warm but how can one be warm alone I want you to do this and this is going to be tricky this going to be tricky for you I want you to examine your Western Independence I'm not saying you're not allowed to be independent I'm saying examine it because Independence does not have to mean unhospitable it doesn't have to mean isolating we live in a desperately isolated world the millennial generation and generations following have been described as quote the loneliest generation in history for the excers in the room you might be like what how is that possible they're always communicating with each other it's because they're actually authentically isolated I want you to look at your your your bumpers and your boundaries and your margins in life the the the Sacred Space that you have or don't have in your life like is your life just packed out all the way 168 hours a week you got 168 hours of of stuff that is not peaceful in 2019 many of you that like have meetings as part of your your job in 2019 you would you would have a meeting and then there would be a break and then you would go to go have a meeting somewhere else and you break you might have a few meetings a day the pandemic happened you had Zoom was introduced into your life you have 47 meetings every single day now and they're back to back to back to back to back you have no margin you can't breathe you can't think it's just non-stop you need margin in your life other people would do this thing where they have margin in their life and they'll fill it up with stuff because they're actually trying to avoid Community they just need something to do to get out of stuff because they have social anxiety or something other people will sign up for everything because they're trying to build community but maybe they're not really good at doing it I here's something you can do I want you to do what I'm going to call a Netflix check Netflix check don't I'm not talking about looking for your profile and seeing what your kids are watching I don't mean that if you're like man I am too busy I can't do that I don't know how to do that I or I don't want to do that I'm just too busy I can't but if you look at your your Netflix or your doom scrolling you got six hours a day of that you got time for community and the fact that you're avoiding it should be a red flag to say hey I'm in trouble emotionally I've got some depression going on I'm isolating myself I'm I'm overwhelmed I'm what this says is you're not in community like you're wrestling with that and it you need to reach out for help on that for others of you you're it's a skill set issue you don't you don't know how to reach out to people and so it's awkward it's uncomfortable for you um and so you reach out or you pretend to reach out or you do things where you're reaching out is really your just so you saved face but you haven't really invited yourself into anyone's life can I just tell you here in New England you got to invite yourself in it it's not you can't it can't come to you can't come it doesn't come to you you got to invite yourself in I I used to coach girls softball young young girls all right and I'm telling you that ball was hit like it would go half a mile an hour it just rolls scoll the ball is rolling you know it's just it's so slow and the the girls are 47 ft away from the ball and they just letting the ball come to them Ball's never get to you you got to go get the ball when it comes to building Community you can't field it you have to go into it am if you're going to do it you have to do it that way last year we did did this survey last year we did this survey on the church and this is what you told us for real you guys told make us talk to each other for real and I'm thinking people don't know how to talk to each other like it looks like people know how to talk to each other I see people everybody talks to the same people all the time so what you told us was we need help in how to communicate and have a relationship with other people we actually don't have that skill set and so we don't know how to do it that's tough that's tough so you have to invite yourself in and then you got to start now if you're like hey hey let me put this in my calendar I got space in September of 2027 to start this got it I got it listen that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about doing it right now that means you're going to be uncomfortable able it's going to be awkward and it can't just be on your terms it can't just be on your terms if there's a way that it's really comfortable for you to do it sometimes you're going to have to get out of that you're going to have to get out of it so Priscilla and Aquilla here are major Heroes they're leaders in the church they're leaders through Hospitality they're leaders through example all because they were committed to the mission of Jesus in everything they did even through it all would you stand with me as we close [Music] today all [Music] right however you would like to respond to this today if if there's some things that you need to talk to Jesus about today please do that the alter are open this might be the one of those sermons where you go home and you just have an honest evaluation with yourself where you're like hm I hadn't really thought about that way before or maybe there's some things I need to do here but this kind of heavy Community happens because of a common Savior and a common Mission our common savior is Jesus our common mission is continuing the mission of Jesus here in our region so we do that together that's why the series is K let's go as the worship team leads us s this song and spend some time around the altars or worshiping together", "everyone i'm christina and i'm pastor emily and i'm on staff at east coast international church and this is our holy week podcast this week we're going to be taking a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it [Music] so christina would you read the passage from matthew yes matthew 21 verses 1 to 11. as jesus and the disciples approached jerusalem they came to the town of bethphage on the mount of olives jesus sent two of them on ahead go into the village over there he said as soon as you enter it you will see a donkey tied there with its cult beside it untie them and bring them to me if anyone asks you what you are doing just say the lord needs them and he will immediately let you take them this took place to fulfill the prophecy that said tell the people of jerusalem look your king is coming to you he is humble riding on a donkey riding on a donkey's colt the two disciples did as jesus commanded they brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt as he and he sat on it most of the crowds spread their garments on the road ahead of him and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road jesus was in the center of the procession and the people all around him were shouting praise god for the son of david blessings on the one who comes in the name of the lord praise god in highest heaven the entire city of jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered who is this they asked and the crowd replied it's jesus the prophet from nazareth in galilee okay so emily i know you've been in this era you've been to israel so can you kind of describe what it looks like to us i'm sure it's changed a bit in the 2000 years right from when i visited to when this was happening but um uh i can just picture the on the mount of olives it's like this beautiful sloping hill and these beautiful olive trees which are kind of like they're um big wide but they're kind of like stout trees anyways they're these gorgeous beautiful trees and so it's like this olive tree grove on a hill and you look down and there's a valley between the mount of olives and it rises to the city wall for the city of jerusalem so my understanding is that the setting of this story would have been jesus was with his disciples in a city bethphage that was only two miles away from jerusalem and would have had to cross through the mount of olives to get to the city of jerusalem and so you kind of have this really cool view where the valley is there and then you see it rising to the city wall and right on the other side of that wall is the temple so it wasn't like you're entering at the front entrance of the city and you have to walk aways to get to the temple it just was like the entrance immediately into the temple if you can kind of picture that so yeah when i read about how close bethany and bethphage is from jerusalem it really struck me so sometimes you think about jesus writing on the donkey and it you don't necessarily get how intentional that was but when you know about the setting you realize jesus didn't need help he didn't need like a ride on a donkey because it was such a long distance right he could have just walked in absolutely absolutely so he he stood there just two miles from the city sent his disciples to go grab the donkey come back so he could ride it in and intentionally waited for that and so you already see this jesus that we love beginning the week with obedience and him knowing all of these prophecies that were that were foretelling what the messiah would do and kind of signs that you would know him by and as he's approaching jerusalem and ultimately approaching the cross on good friday he is beginning this process of weighty obedience to this incredible task at hand um so that just really struck me when looking at the triumphal entry and kind of the setting of the whole thing but i know there's a passage there that gets a little bit more into the donkey um from the old testament perspective so i'd love to hear about that right yeah going going along perfectly with that intentionality uh jesus was fulfilling a prophecy and the reference is zechariah 9 9 so we're going to take a look at that um one interesting thing is that john matthew and john are the ones who quote this passage and john says do not be afraid uh that's not actually in the zechariah passage but it's interesting because it speaks to what the zechariah passage is trying to say and so what the what the passage actually says is uh verse nine and eight uh sorry verse nine and ten in zechariah nine it says rejoice greatly daughter zion shout daughter jerusalem see your king comes to you righteous and victorious lowly and riding on a donkey on a colt the foal of a donkey i will take away the chariots from ephraim and the war horses from jerusalem and the battle bull will be broken he will proclaim peace to the nations his rule will extend from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth and so uh the the literal translation of the description of this man riding in on donkey is that he is just endowed with salvation and humble and so why is jesus riding in on a donkey what is the difference um if you see in verse 10 it talks about war horses so a lot of times when kings were riding into war they would be riding on horses but riding in on a donkey was a symbolism a symbolism of peace jesus was coming to bring peace and i think it's really interesting to look back at this passage in zechariah because it's talking about how he's going to defeat the enemies of jerusalem in a sense he's going to take away their weapons and proclaim peace from from sea to thief like over the entire world yeah i love that take away their weapons yeah and we think about the power of sin and the power of death and how jesus has overcome those and taken away those weapons yeah and we have this incredible promise and yet it's not the kind of war that you would imagine if you're a human looking at things from human perspectives right um there's one of the things that i've loved is this um as we're preparing for this holy week is i get to read all the passages from all four gospels and see the distinct perspectives that they highlight and this talk of like jesus as this prince of peace coming in on a donkey kind of this humility and just upside down kingdom that he's presenting really struck a chord with me when i read this passage in luke luke highlights this really unique moment where jesus is weeping over jerusalem he comes over it kind of depicts him coming over the crest of the hill of the mount of olives and looking at the city as he approaches and just busting out in tears and um he says right in chapter 19 verse 42 of luke how i wish today that you of all people would understand the way to peace but now it is too late and peace is hidden from your eyes and then he goes on to talk about some of the um horrors that that city was going to see in terms of uh coming war and destruction and things like that as we know the temple that he was approaching has been destroyed and was destroyed after his time and so it's like here he is this prince of peace god of the universe coming to his rightful uh place to his rightful home and what is to be his throne room and um and it's this incredible moment and yet there's this somber kind of sadness about it for jesus because he knows that not everybody understands what's happening not everybody gets the gravity of this moment right so yeah let's talk about the reactions as jesus was riding in on the donkey um what talk a little bit about that yeah so the different gospels talk about different reactions i don't want to take too much time reading all of the different verses but i thought it was really kind of cool to hear the disciples were like the first ones to react and it says that when he was in the mount of olives before he even got to the city that they just started bursting out in praise which is kind of cool if you think about it these people were with him right all the time they were asking him questions like they ate with jesus they you know they camped with jesus i mean they probably at some point you know heard jesus burp or something like that you know like they were very familiar with this guy but but they understood and they saw the moment and so his disciples the ones closest to him were the first ones to just kind of like recognize that and they were like well praise god they were crying out and then the pharisees happened to be nearby the good old pharisees always there to you know be party poopers and some of the pharisees said jesus get your disciples under control yeah but it cracks me i'm so sassy like get him under control jesus this is ridiculous jesus at that moment says if they don't if they don't worship me the very rocks will cry out which i love that because this is jesus is being very planned and meticulous with riding in on a donkey and kind of coming in in this time frame and everything but then here are these spontaneous reactions and jesus is kind of saying no like all of creation like is like vibrating at the power of this moment and my disciples are the ones that get to worship me you want me to shut them up if i shut them up the rocks are going to cry out so i love that part yeah um but so you've you've got kind of all of these different pieces and then there's also the crowd that praises jesus as he's entering the city and so it's called palm sunday because they were putting palms or reeds and coats and things on the floor for him kind of making like an ancient israel kind of red carpet deal for him to walk in on yeah and um that crowd was full of people who had heard about jesus's recent miracle with lazarus how he raised lazarus from the dead and so those are the people that are like you know saying hosanna and like crying out and this passage we just read from matthew that talks about how like there was an uproar as he was entering the city this is the triumphal entry kind of moment you see people bursting out in the streets of jerusalem as he's walking in yeah yeah i'd love to hear a little bit more about the words that they're using because i know that they are they're calling out to him and worshipping him using old testament language and so i'd love to hear a little bit more about the meaning behind those yeah so they're they're um referencing him as the son of david or um yeah hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord and so this specifically is from referencing or using words from psalm 118 25 and 26 but i want to touch on that um the son of david like what is that all about and so going back to 2nd samuel 7 16 there's this passage where god is talking to david um david he's he's um possibly on his deathbed he's on his way out and solomon is about to take over the kingdom but god makes this amazing promise to him and he says your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me your throne will be established forever and so so god is making this very lofty promise to david that someone from david's line will always be on the throne um and then again in luke 1 31-33 the angel gabriel when he's talking to mary about jesus he says you will conceive and give birth to a son and you are to call him jesus he will be great and will be called the son of the most high the lord god will give him the throne of his father david and he will reign over jacob's descendants forever his kingdom will never end and so there's this prophecy that david's line would never end and then jesus is the fulfillment of that because jesus he's eternal he's going to live forever he's coming to take the throne of david that will be everlasting and there are lots of um prophecies like this we could we couldn't cover them all in this passage but but jesus is basically he's being very intentional about showing that he is the one coming to reign forever on the throne of david as was spoken about in the old testament yeah i love that because a lot of times people question who jesus is and when you really look at what he did and he was making choices to to help people identify him as the messiah yeah and you know for those who pay attention it becomes so clear right yeah um also matthew references um in verse 11 he says the crowds replied it's jesus the prophet from nazareth and galilee there were also things um that talked about jesus that talked about the galilee something interesting in isaiah 9 that i was looking at says but in the future he will honor galilee of the nations by the way of the sea beyond the jordan the people walking in the darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned and then verses six and seven say and a lot of you have probably heard this in the christmas season for to us a child is born to us the sun is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end he will reign on david's throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from the time on and forever the zeal of the lord almighty will accomplish this and i just think during this time when jesus is coming in during this procession as he's riding on on a donkey many of the people saying hosanna probably know this passage well yeah and they're thinking to this time when their their king come to reign on the throne of david will bring peace and will reign over their enemies and will bring righteousness and justice and and this passage and passages like these are all throughout the old testament and now here jesus is very intentionally showing i i'm this man that you've been waiting for yeah that's awesome yeah i think like jerusalem must have been a really interesting city to be in because it's this capital of israel right but israel is under roman occupation and so there's um all of this religious stuff associated with judaism there but there's also all of these people who are not jews in the city who are regular but um we know that this week was a festival week and so a lot of people would do a pilgrimage to the city of jerusalem right to be able to celebrate that so the city of jerusalem was actually full of god-fearing jewish people at this time more full than it normally was like it was kind of like i mean almost like you know if you imagine like the world cup happening or something like that and a bunch of people who are like real soccer fans like come and show up and and the city's kind of like swollen with masses of of people that's kind of what was going on in this moment and a lot of those people were hearing these rumors about jesus hearing these testimonies and these stories you know the raising of lazarus and uh and and his teaching and miracles and casting out demons all the stuff he had done and they were recognizing him as this promised messiah but not everybody in the city did it definitely was a mixed bag and matthew kind of highlights the idea that you know there was a crowd worshiping jesus but then on the outskirts of that the rest of the city was kind of like shaken up and kind of like what's going on who is this guy like what's the big deal right um and i like the way the message puts it the message translation um says people were unnerved and confused when they heard the uproar of the triumphal procession so you really have this interesting moment with all these different characters playing their part and jesus is stepping into not just the city of jerusalem but the temple and it's this really really powerful thing and it's powerful not really necessarily because of what happened that day like the moan itself is packed with far more significance than it seems anyone understood except perhaps jesus himself but we get the privilege to look back and reflect on what it was that was really happening in light of what we know what we know happened during the rest of that week that jesus proved himself and and died and was was risen again and um so yeah but this was a huge foreshadowing moment right this was a moment where jesus was kind of saying like i have arrived you know and i'm taking my rightful place here i am i'm like i'm the king come like and um there are so many passages in the old testament that talk about this idea of the messiah coming and all the things that the messiah is going to do and we know that many of those things still haven't happened yet because we're still waiting for jesus to come back we're still waiting for jesus to fully establish his reign on the earth and not just like we know that jesus is the king of all and we know that he's sitting on the throne in glory in heaven but he's not on the earth right now and so in this moment he was foreshadowing that right this was all basically uh symbol symbolism in the sense that jesus wasn't coming right now right then to like uh be like okay romans i'm coming after you and like my reign of peace is like starting this moment and i'm gonna take over the world and a lot of people might have wanted him to do that or might have been expecting him to do that but really this um this coming in on a donkey and and fulfilling all these old testament prophecies was symbolism for something to come in the future that that we ourselves are still looking towards and i remember you even talking about a passage in mark about how he did this whole big thing and then he just went home right yeah yeah mark just says yes so he like stepped into the temple he took it all in and then he turned around and went home because it was late like it's just so funny to imagine like all of this like kind of like hullabaloo you know like all of this like uproar about his entry to the city and then he just turns right right back around and goes back to like yeah you know like his airbnb wasn't an airbnb but like he's like staying with friends over in you know a town two two miles over and yeah um yeah so it was it was very real his coming yeah but it was also very symbolic of everything that is to come right and that's something that i'm really looking forward to exploring on a deeper level throughout this week as we continue to look at what jesus was doing on each of the days and just talk about not only how he fulfilled what has been prophesied but the hope that we have for all that he's going to do and just the gratitude for me like just thinking about jesus coming to that into that city in the triumphal entry like i'm so glad he did it the way he did because he showed up he let humanity know you're not abandoned my plan of salvation is in full swing like you're not just hanging on for dear life hoping one day god will make things right like no i've already begun the work i've already done as a matter of fact it is finished right like he said on the cross and yet he's leaving space so that his grace can take effect on the earth and we're still waiting for the completion of all that he has but like peter talks about we know that he's he's not slow he's patient he's not being slow to fulfill his promises he's being patient because he doesn't want anyone to miss out right and so that's this jesus that we worship and that we're celebrating this holy week yeah i'd love to close in prayer would you mind leading us in prayer for today yeah of course all right dear jesus we thank you for uh the privilege of being able to study your word and being able to look back at this amazing story that has spanned thousands of years god and i thank you that i'm a part of that god that i'm a part of this story and that you welcome you welcome us into learning more about what you've done god and it's just so amazing lord it's so amazing to see it all and fold and i pray that you would help us to continue to search your scriptures to uncover these magnificent mysteries of how you love us and how big your grace is and how big your plan is and just how intentional you were and god it's it's so amazing i thank you for that jesus and i pray that you would be with us as we continue this podcast lord that it would be in your hands and that you would use it to open our eyes to the the message of of grace that is there for us god i thank you for what you did jesus in your name i pray amen amen all right thank you guys for joining us today we hope you listen to our next podcast yeah have a good day [Music] that you died [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] you", "all right good morning everyone oh man man encourage your brothers and sisters good morning everybody all right great to see you hey I don't know if you noticed who was praying for over you this morning here uh Kyla there you know she wasn't even born when we started the church so you know some of you just got really old right there I know some of you got really old right there but I just want you to know that some of some of you your children are going to lead lead the church in prayer someday and someday your children are going to take over the church okay so it's really really important we need to go in obediently follow God in the same direction for a really long time okay we're making making lots of progress in fact uh over the last couple of weeks we've continued to add several Chairs into this room between the two Services um just so that you don't feel like you're all crowded on top of each other because the church continues to grow and uh people come back uh for the fall so it's an exciting season of growth here um we're going to continue our series here tearing down strongholds when my grandparents retired they they moved near my hometown uh to be near my family and it was really a gift to my life although they were not wealthy people in fact they didn't have much money at all so they grew their own food and they made many of the things that they needed with their own hands uh they had what they called a garden but it was really a small farm and it was amazing to watch this patch of land every year be transformed into a fruitful and abundant Harvest that provided more than enough food for them for my family for their friends enough food to trade and barter with as well yes I remember around the house in their house they had these guides the these guide books that would tell them when they needed to plan certain vegetables and when they needed to harvest those vegetables and you know what the right vegetables to plant near each other you they had all this this was like a very special set of guide books that they would follow in order to know what to do with their garden now imagine with me okay I'll pay attention to this or you won't understand the rest of the sermon now imagine with me if our lives were a garden imagine if our lives were a garden that needed to be grown and imagine if we have a book that tells us how that Garden is supposed to be grown what and when we are supposed to be planting in our lives I want you to think about that idea today The Garden of Your Life in Genesis chter 1 vers 11 going all the way to the beginning of the Bible it says then God said let the H let the land Sprout with vegetation every swort of seed bearing plant and trees that grow seed bearing fruit these seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came and that is what happened from the very beginning the Mandate of God has been for living things to reproduce to expand or to grow that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to grow some of you like to grow more than others I know right but we're supposed to grow you'll notice in in life and in nature trees grow and forests expand animals grow and their packs expand even the Universe we know is expanding because God never told it to stop am we're supposed to keep on growing God wants us to keep on growing as well wants the garden of our life to grow and as we wrap up this tearing down stronghold Series where we've learned a lot of stuff about repenting and renouncing and breaking curses and removing yourself and forgiving others and fighting like you mean it because you're in the war of a lifetime amen today we're going to take this turn and talk about how you must intentionally grow The Garden of your life last week Pastor Emily got us started on this theme of growing and thank you Pastor Emily she did a great job last week um it got it started on this theme of growing spiritually and even talked about a few misconceptions and and I'm jumping off that theme a little bit further today so we're going to I'm going to let you know what we're talking about we're going to talk about four myths about spiritual growth and we're going to talk about four facts spiritual growth four myths four facts so myth number one it's going to be pretty easy to track where I'm at in the sermon today myth number one is growth is automatic all right spiritual growth is not automatic it's a myth second Peter chapter 1 says this verse 5 in view of all this make every effort somebody say make every effort make every effort to respond to God's promises supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence and moral Excellence with knowledge skipping to verse 8 the more you grow like this the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ the three ver three words I want you to zo zoom in on is make every effort the idea here is that if you're going to grow spiritually if you're going to grow in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and be more productive you have to make every effort it's not automatic in other words growth does not happen automatically you can't sit back and wait and expect it to happen it takes planning it takes commitment it takes work none of this happens by accident you don't accidentally grow spiritually amen maturing takes an intentionality it doesn't happen on the fly it doesn't happen by wishful thinking it doesn't happen by even positive thinking and positive confession come on now if you're standing there looking at the mirror every morning saying to yourself I will grow I will grow I will grow strong and tall I will be spiritually strong today I will be a beautiful garden my soul smells like a delightful and delicate Rose you can stand in front of the mirror all day like that it will not help you you might hope but it's not going to help deciding to go to the next level requires effort amen but do you know what happens to the Garden of your life if you don't put any effort in it's like any Garden it ends up filled with weeds because every Garden that is unattended to is filled with Weeds last week we learned that growth is possible this week we learned that growth requires us to make every effort yes learning to apply God's word in your life is an effort that requires cultivating one of the most important words to develop in growing your garden is the word how someone say how how Okay is the word how a lot of people when they read the Bible and are trying to to move forward in their spiritual life they lead with the wrong word they lead with the word why God tells them to do something the immediate instinct is to say why come on it's the wrong it's the wrong first word the first word should be how amen once you've done the how you'll know the why yes see the reason that we want to know the why first is because we still want to be in charge we still want to be God in our own life so the reason we want to know why is so that we can decide if we really want to do it or not because we still want to be in charge a lot of people want to ask why which is understandable because we all have the same Fallen nature but honestly it should be the second question not the first most of the time we can figure out the why once we've done the how so if you and God are growing this great Garden in your life and you've got some awesome Tomatoes going on and some cucumbers and some peppers and some a pumpkin patch and a few rows of corn and some onions and some garlic and some potatoes and all of a sudden in the garden guide instructions it says this season start growing a pomegranate tree of forgiving your enemies the question is not why it is how or if the guide says next season along the rear fence begin growing a raspberry patch of sexual Purity amen it's not why it's how you're like that guide is rough if if the guide says next season after hammer your swords into plowshares and their Spears into pruning hooks so that Nation will no longer fight against Nation nor train for war anymore I'm on now how not why how you see this is the nature of spiritual growth we get instructions from the scripture we apply it we tend to the Garden we make every effort and it's the how that matters how do you do these things these things are not easy these are difficult things to do and it takes every effort to spiritually grow yeah myth number two and be careful with this one listen very carefully so you don't think I'm a heretic myth number two is this growth comes in the presence of God that's a myth growth comes in the presence of God it's a myth it might surprise you that it's a myth because it sounds like it should be true it seems like it should be true and it seems like it should be true because it's almost true almost you see you can attend church regularly be around around the presence of God go to conferences read good books but that doesn't guarantee growth am I want you to think about the Israelites for a second escaping Egyptian slavery after multiple miraculous interventions including walking through a sea and a pillar of fire and a cloud leading them and persistent miraculous presence of God the grace and mercy of God had been revealed to them over and over and over and over again and yet when the critical moment of decision comes whether or not to go into the promised land the people are finally getting ready to go in to the land that God promises them he tells them to go in they send in 12 Scouts and two of them come back with a good and confident report and say we can go in and the other 10 come back with a fearful report and the Israelites listen to the fearful negative report amen these are people that have been in the presence of God in unbelievable ways even Mariah KY sang a song about it come on now I mean unbelievable and still numbers 14 then the whole Community began weeping aloud they cried all night their voices Rose in a great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron the leaders if only we had died in Egypt and even here in the wilderness they complain these are people that had experienced the presence of God continuously why is the Lord taking us to this country only to have us die in battle our wives and our little ones will be carried off as plunder wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt then they plotted among themselves let's choose a new leader and go back to Egypt these are people that have been in the presence of God it clearly did not end in spiritual growth although they had experienced countless moments in the presence of God and the personal knowledge of God and his ways this is what had happened you see observing the presence of God is not the same thing as participating with the presence of God Amen to very I'm going to say it again observing the presence of God is not the same thing as participating with the presence of God watching other people praise God is not the same thing as personally praising God hallelujah you see the Israelites walked through the Red Sea amen they walked through the sea love it how in the world how in the world did they not become spiritually mature some of you are thinking to yourself if I walk through the sea and I saw the the sea up on the right and the left or however it was done and I'm walking through I would never doubt God again not a single second for the rest of my life amen these people doubted Non-Stop they walked through the Red Sea how is it that somebody can have experienced the things that they experienced and still not be spiritually mature it's because of this it was somebody else that obeyed God it was somebody else that stepped out in faith they just happened to be in the neighborhood they were nearby they're like this crowd's going in the right direction I'll head over here all right they got the benefit of being in the presence of God yes they got to the other side this is a critical thing if if if you happen to I'm going to talk to some of you for those of you that grew up in a church environment like I I grew up in church I've been in church almost every single Sunday of my life and many many other days as well um for those of you that grew up very very very very familiar with the things of God one of the terrifying things is that you can become so familiar with the things of God and the presence of God that uh you forget to personally engage with the presence of God and you have to you have to engage yourself and say oh this is for me this isn't for them this is for me I'm no better than anybody else I need the presence of God just as much as anybody you see watching a person get set free is not the same thing as getting set free yourself going to the pool is not the same thing as swimming in the pool so when you're in the presence of God make sure you're participating with the presence of God yes this is a very important thing the Israelites are just one of many many examples of how you can be near the presence of God and it not result in spiritual growth you got to participate myth number number three growth comes with age or growth comes with time there this is a huge difference between uh there's a huge difference between growing old and growing up amen two very different things there's plenty of fully grown boys today out in the world Amen you know they're not fully grown men they're fully grown boys it's like some people spiritually somehow manage to turn off their spiritual growth like in spiritual middle School their body keeps growing but their spiritual life does not amen that's why First Corinthians tells us uh it says put aside childish things yes you know it's time to grow up right you're you're growing you're you're maturing you got to put aside childish things to to move on to adult things to mature things amen spiritual growth it's more difficult it's more complicated myth number four growth comes from information or growth comes from knowledge listen if that was true if that were true every fantasy football player in America would be awesome at playing football I mean you can know everything about the game you can know about the stats you can read the articles you can watch all the games and still be entirely clueless on how to play the game of football all right now I don't know if you know this but Jesus had a brother named James and the brother of Jesus um wrote one of the books in the Bible called James and in one of the Bibles most snarky moments um he addresses this issue and uh very directly he says in James chapter 2 you say you have faith for you believe that there is one God good for [Music] you even the demons believe this and they tremble in Terror you see it's the good for you part all right you might not have caught that when you read it but that's what it means okay that's how he's writing it okay it it's very clear that that it it's not it's it doesn't matter without the next step to the knowledge and belief is not enough it's the application of it that matters it's the application of it that leads to growth both yes you can know all the right things and still be entirely wrong amen you can study the garden you can have a picture of the garden you can hang a little emblem of the garden around your neck you can understand the origins of gardening but until you start planting the seeds in the garden you won't get a garden amen growth does not come simply from information all right those are some fun myths here's a few facts four facts about growth uh fact number one is growth takes time yes it do takes time I don't know if you've noticed this but most children are not born fully grown now I'm not a mother uh and I don't expect at this moment in life that I ever will be but I think it's safe to say that every mother is glad that children aren't born fully grown and this because children need time to grow they need to learn to walk they need to learn to talk to recognize shapes and colors to be polite to acquire social skills as they grow uh they learn to study to play sports to play musical instruments perhaps then they need to learn how to drive a car how to survive on their own to find a job to do a job they need to learn to build relationships maybe to uh uh raise a child to Mentor people to give to love and the truth is as humans we're never supposed to stop growing on and even as Christians those that want to follow Jesus there's never a point in our spiritual journey that we can say we have arrived on no matter what your Google Maps app says you have not arrived you have not arrived Hebrews CH 12 says this for our Earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years doing the best they knew how but God's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we will share in his Holiness no discipline is enjoyable while it is happening it is painful but afterward there will be a quiet Harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way yes just idea of growth you know I want to give you an idea there's there's oak trees oak trees some oak trees can take hundreds and hundreds of years to grow in fact one particular oak tree can take up to 2,000 years to completely grow by comparison a squash only takes a couple months to grow so if you want to be an oak tree it takes longer if you want to be a squash it doesn't take as long there are no shortcuts you will in fact need to be in it for the long haul there are no Tick Tock life hacks to hack the system so listen knowing that it's going to take some time first be kind to yourself amen it's going to take some time and be patient yes second fact is growth takes work somebody say work growth takes work after the church planner Paul uh left Ephesus there was a young Pastor named Timothy who took his place he became the pastor of the church and Paul would periodically write Timothy letters to Mentor him and he in one of his letters he talked about the work that it would take for him to grow Amen in first Timothy chapter 4 this is one of the letters he says until I get there focus on reading the scriptures to the church encouraging the Believers and teaching them do not neglect the spiritual gift you receiv received through the prophecies spoken to you when the Elders of the church laid their hands on you give your complete attention to these matters throw yourself into your task so that everyone will see your progress keep a close watch on yourself and on your teaching stay true to what is right and God will save you and those who hear you yes the mentor is instructing Timothy to diligently get to work so you need to work because it it takes real work to grow real work you got to throw yourself into it you're you're you're going for it not five minutes but a significant amount of work now many of you have seen this uh this foot this uh poem called Footprints in the Sand you know this poem out there and you see it on plaques or inspirational posters or cups or laminated cards or you know they're all over the place and like if you have if you have seven of these you get like extra points in heaven or something like Footprints in the Sand uh uh uh poems that you own and and basically if you don't know the poem it basically is this idea of God carrying you through the difficult times in life all right and and it's it's great great awesome poem but maybe you have not heard about the sister poem to Footprints in the Sand that um I think perhaps many of you have not heard this and it's not as well known and I'd like to read it to you today with permission [Music] amen I apologize in advance one night I had a wondrous dream one set of footprints there was seen the footprints of my precious Lord but mine were not along the shore but then some stranger Prince appeared and I asked the Lord what have we here these prints are large and round and neat but Lord they are too big for feet my child he said in somber tones for Miles I carried you alone I challenged you to walk in faith but you refused and made me wait you disobeyed you would not grow the Walk of Faith you would not know so I got tired I got fed up there I dropped you on your [Music] butt because in life there comes a time when one must fight and one must climb when one must rise and take a stand or leave their butt prints in the sand so so I apologize in advance okay so in other words growth takes work you got to get to work you got get to work fact number three growth takes change growth takes change growth requires change now change is uh one of the worst things that people could be asked to do people hate change I mean for real most people avoid it if at all possible we just would prefer things to stick the old way and our old traditions the way we know how to do it even if it's the worst way am we just don't want to change if you don't believe me just watch Facebook for the first two weeks after Facebook changes anything on its platform and you'll see anybody over the age of 50 is freaking out for like two weeks complaining they think there's like government conspiracies getting into their brain or something you know it's crazy it's crazy people just do not like change people do not like they just want to stick with what they know why do we find change so hard because it involves leaving a lot of times leaving something that we know or familiar with sometimes it means leaving behind people or places or positions or Comforts or relationships things stuff sometimes change involves a sense of loss amen loss of things that we perhaps don't want to give up change frequently involves uh obedience obedience to God change may involve Faith beyond what is comfortable to you us if if you are here today and if you do a serious evaluation of your faith and you think to yourself I am authentically comfortable with where I'm at in my faith right now you're doing it wrong right now right we're supposed to change forward we're supposed to move into the uncomfortable like a hint of uncomfortable like continuously in in the Old Testament Abraham had to make major changes in his life in order to obey God and to continue on his faith Journey watch Watch What Happens Genesis 12 then the Lord told Abram leave your country your relatives and your father's house that's a lot of change and go to the land I will show you I will cause you to become the father of a great nation I will bless you make you famous I will make you a blessing to others I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you all the families of the earth will be blessed through you so Abram departed as the Lord had instructed him and lot went with him Abram was 75 years old when he left heran it's a very interesting passage in order for Abraham to experience the blessing of God he had to do a major change yeah it was significant change now changing does not automatically necessarily equal growth but growth always equals change amen so you can just change things up that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to grow but in order to grow you will have to change something there can be no growth without change and for you today changing May simply be the act of saying yes to Jesus maybe Jesus is trying maybe Jesus has been after you to say yes to something and you haven't said yes and so it's time to say yes am or maybe it's coming clean about something maybe you have like something you're hiding or secret sin or something and in in order to find Freedom and break the curse of that stronghold you just need to come clean about it hallelujah or or learning to live a life that does not involve any pretending no pretending no lies just being vulnerable before God and other people it's scary amen that involves a lot of change no pretending these are all scary moments really scary and they lead to real growth and they lead to real transformative change but so often that's exactly what it requires that level of change and it's scary and terrifying but that's what we're being invited into yes whenever you experience in your life moments of spiritual stagnation uh it that needs to be met with an allout internal look and willingness to wreak havoc on your current place so that you could move forward and grow higher than ever before amen here's what happens most of the time in America most of the time in America when people feel this sense of spiritual stagnation they look externally instead of internally amen it must be somebody else's fault that I'm being spiritually stagnant and so you start to move yourself from one spiritual environment to a different spiritual environment to a different spiritual environment and what's going to end up happening is you'll experience a moment of refreshing and newness only to find out that you're still spiritually stagnant later on because it's really the internal work that has to be done yes number four growth takes growth takes help or growth requires help for from other people yes Ephesians 4:16 says under his Direction the whole body is fitted together perfectly as each part does its own special work it helps other parts grow so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love in other words we need each other we need to minister to each other and care for each other and as we do we will help each other to grow we need to be accountable to each other and we need to support and encourage each other I learned a long time ago that some of the people that you need in your life to help you grow the most are some of the people that you would probably not identify as the people that could help you grow oh no help us you see God has little surprises for you from some of the most unlikely sources this is the nature of being part of a family this is the nature of being part of the kingdom of God we can all grow and we all have different gifts and we can all learn from each other yes and it's extremely important as you're considering those things we're going to go back to the the idea of the Israelites being right on the edge of the promised land listening to the reports and I want you to think in your own life today whose report you will believe in Numbers chapter 13: 27 here was the report that came in from the two spies they said we entered the land you sent us to explore it is indeed a Beau a bountiful country a land flowing with milk and honey here is the kind of fruit it produces but the people living there are powerful and their towns are large and fortified we even saw giants there the descendants of ano the amalik amalekites live in the ngev the Hittites jebusites amorites live in the Hill Country the Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Jordan Valley right so he he tells the whole truth it's good and bad but Caleb one of the good spies tried to quiet the people and stood before Moses and said let's go at once to take the land he said we can certainly conquer it so he saw what was true and was entirely convinced that because God told them to go it was entirely capable of them to conquer it the other report caused people to be scared and impotent it led to fear and trembling because their report Was Fear filled instead of Faith filled and this happen so much in our life where we are brought to a moment of decision in our life and we have to decide whose report we will believe amen are we going to listen to the the word and instruction of God or are we going to listen to the torment and fears of the enemy whose words will you believe as the worship team comes up there are going to be those around you or or or or these the these voices that you hear that say things like this to you they're going to say to you that you can't grow that you can't grow anymore that you can't be spiritually mature that sure it's good on the other side of where you're at but that's not really for you because you can't possibly get there that there is a Next Level there is a next level but next levels are for other people and it's not going to happen for you sure there's elevation that you can gain but it's all in your imagination you're not the one that's going to get there am you know what we call these people we call these people haters and in life there's always going to be haters because haters be hating that's what haters do and do you know what you do with haters you make haters your escalators right you make haters your escalators listen don't listen don't hate the haters make them your escalators for real let them Elevate you Amen Let Them Elevate you get let them be your fuel all right Deuteronomy chapter 28 if you listen to those commands of the lord your God that I am giving you today if you carefully obey them that's the work and effort the Lord will make you head and not the tail and you will always be on top and never at the bottom I this is one of my like I I have this is my favorite verse in the whole Bible I say that for about a thousand verses in the Bible I know but this is like my other favorite verse in the whole Bible the Lord will make you the head and not the tail yeah and you will always be on top and never the bottom amen I don't think you understand the Lord will make you the head and not the tail and you will always be on the top and never at the [Music] bottom if you feel like a tail today if you feel like you're at the bottom for real if that's where you're at right now you have some work to go right you have of growth to make am I am declaring over each of you today this promise you are the head and not the tail you will be on the top and never again at the bottom now Satan would like to report to you something different Satan would like to report to you to somebody here today that Jesus is dead in your life that there is no hope for you that you've gone too far with your sin he wants you to believe in evil report he wants you to believe that abundance is for somebody else and not for you he wants you to believe the garden that Jesus wants to grow within you can't happen because the soil of your life is not valuable enough the soil of your life is too hard the soil of your life is too broken the soil of your life is too polluted the soil of your life has been too used abused and thrown out come on help us and listen to you the soil of your life when you look in the mirror it might look like a deserted Wilderness it might in fact look like an impossible and Barren Wasteland but there is no soil too hard for God Amen there is no desert too dry for God there is no Wilderness too dist for God to get to that's why in Isaiah 35 it says this even the Wilderness and desert will be glad in those days the Wasteland will rejoice and Blossom with spring crocuses yes there will be an abundance of flowers and singing and joy the deserts will become as green as the mountains of Lebanon as lovely as Mount Carmel or the plain of Sharon there the Lord will display his glory the Splendor of our God in other words God will grow your garden God will grow your garden hear this God wants to grow your garden so keep on planting keep on growing and Keep On Believing amen and Friends listen don't give up don't give up on God because he most certainly will never give up on you am so no matter what the world says no matter what the report of the world is believe the report of the Lord you can grow yes and the garden he is growing in you is going to grow and bear great fruit yes it is why don't you stand with me as we [Music] close listen today you might need to bring the soil of your life to God today you might need to say yes you I maybe you need to stop pretending maybe you need to stop holding something in secret you just need to bring it out to God I want to encourage you to do that today maybe you've been listening to the wrong report maybe you've been being way too comfortable and it's time to shake it up and move forward so want you to know this is how we tear down strongholds and and is how we keep them torn down so we grow this garden and we keep it growing and watch it bear fruit the altars are open right now as the worship team leads us let's spend some time praying [Music]", "[Applause] all right good morning everyone morning the uh so as you can tell from the video we're going to talk about love uh today and so you're thinking perhaps oh it's great love I need a little encouragement today uh we're going to probably go in a little different direction than that so uh hang with me some of you are going to start off real strong here and then at the end you're going to be really questioning whether or not Jesus is who you want to follow okay so that's where we're that's where we're going today but before we do oh on Friday this Friday over at The Loft at 31 Stetson Street on the second floor we have a young adults Gathering ages 18 to 30 unplugged at The Loft 700 p.m. uh please join us if you're 18 to 30 if you're like 39 or 49 and you feel young adult don't come don't come don't come like you might be like well Pastor Kurt I'm young at heart we're not talking about your heart we're talking about your actual age okay so uh like but I play I'm I'm I play video games in a basement can I come no no 18 to30 18 to30 unplugg at to Loft please join us 7:00 p.m. um it's Tuesday uh we have something that we call light the night and uh if you're new around here I just want to explain what's going on light the night is a is a community outreach that we do each year and have done for 22 years it is uh not us celebrating Halloween I know it's complicated sometimes for people to parse the difference but and the reason would be because Halloween definitely has some problematic connections to it if you hadn't noticed like cult kind of things or witchcraft or tarot cards or seances or fortune telling or astrology or horoscopes or paganism and I could keep going but you get the idea there's lots of unfortunate connections to Halloween and here's why that's a problem those things are spiritual in nature and a lot of times people just think it's fake uh that would be incorrect it's false it's not fake meaning it's real but it's not of God and the problem is for potential long-term see these things are all spiritual in nature and it can create a spiritual long-term demonic attachment to unsuspecting people for the rest of their life and they have no idea what's going on because they just thought they were fooling around with something that they really didn't understand had real deep spiritual significance so why is it that every Halloween we do something called light the night it is our way to recognize that most people are just out looking for candy and um and I recognize we recognize that the whole Community is just outside in this weird thing one time a year like if if you were an alien coming from outer space and landed like here in October 30th like wonder what you would think was going on uh in America but the whole Community is outside one time a year and we just want to bring some light into people's lives and sometimes what is a dark season so we're going to have some uh little kids kids light kids games we're going to have some safe places for families to pause and have conversations it's literally an attempt to create Community connect and reconnect with people and remind people that God hasn't forgotten them so if you want to be part of that uh we're asking for volunteers so sign up on the church Center app today and we'll give you some information by email after that all right now go back in history quite some time before there were movies before there was Spotify uh before there was just really easy access to to music and things if people were going to talk about love a lot of times they wrote a poem like a poem about love it's they write the poem and it would get shared around and people would like think about it and dream about oh this poem about love it's so wonderful then with music you know you have the songs about love and in fact if you're a modern uh artist today you're going to try to talk about love a few times and your albums and your and your your playlists are going to be filled with songs about love or then there's movies you know movies there's always a movie out about Love Somehow or some perception of Love um the ones that really get me the movies that really get me that kind of hit me in the heart are the ones about love between families and the the particularly the ones about dads and and their kids like that that gets me and so love is an important part of who we are and what we do one time Jesus was talking about love normally one of Jesus's most popular topics this is a moment when people huddle around and in the middle of this discussion Jesus says and you can find it in John 15 this discussion about love Jesus says this there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends now I think that most people hear that and like that makes sense Jesus that's a good one I aspire to being willing to lay my life down for a friend or a family member someone that I love and I think that in the course of human history there have been many people that have laid down their life for the life of another person and we honor them we have heard of parents laying down their life for their children and we've heard of thousands of Heroes in times of war that have sacrificed their lives for the lives of other people this summer my wife and I went to the beaches and cliffs of Normandy where on one day 4,414 young men willingly sacrificed their life in just one day to help bring an end to the Nazi occupation in France and the world and to stop the Holocaust Jen's grandfather was a Medal of Honor recipient and he came into France on those very beaches with his tank Division and many laid down their lives that day so that other people could live and so we honor that day and we honor the heroes of of That World War II in setting uh people free and so the idea it makes sense to us culturally we we have these uh standards of what it means to be a hero and so when Jesus says that to our ears it makes sense it's not unfamiliar language but whenever Jesus does this kind of stuff where he says something that it's really easy to agree with get ready okay get ready for something more difficult at another time Jesus does something and he's in the middle of preaching he's preaching what is called the greatest sermon in history or The Sermon on the Mount and there's thousands of people on this on this Hillside and Jesus's teaching and so far in the sermon he's talked about about several great things he's he's taught about God's blessings and his God's promises and he's given great encouragement to the people and and he encourages righteous living and then he really encourages people to double down and Excel at the basics and then he says don't kill people even in your heart don't kill people in your heart and then he says adultery is forbidden and that means also no adultery in your heart uh Jesus what happened to the blessings and promises that you were just talking about you know like he he starts here he starts with the stuff that's really easy to get your head around and then he he's going taking you deeper he's taking you deeper he's helping you to understand that the kingdom is different his kingdom is very different than all the other kingdoms of the world he says to the people to honor your marriage and don't get divorced seriously no divorce that's what Jesus said unless there is unfaithfulness and then you have to decide what you will do in other words you can't have a bad day or a week or a month or a year and just decide hey I'm done Jesus said it be careful with your words he says and honor your word so Jesus's starting to get into your business at this point he says things like don't pursue Revenge you can see that Jesus keeps ramping it up he's ramping up his teaching and imagine at this point people are like I don't know about this guy anymore things are getting more and more and more difficult because I started off as kind of a woooo Jesus go you're the best kind of like it and those people suddenly calming down a little bit and ends up clearly being the most radically different teaching in history that anyone had ever heard and we're not even to the difficult stuff yet then Jesus says this Matthew 5:43 he's talking about love you have heard the law that says love your neighbor and hate your enemy somebody in the crowd's like mm right you got it Jesus hate my enemy but I say love your enemies pray for those who persecute you in that way you will be acting as true true children of your father in Heaven for he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good and he sends Reign on the just and the unjust alike if you love only those who love you what reward is there for that even corrupt Tax Collectors do that much if you are kind only to your friends how are you different from anyone else even pagans do that but you are to be perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect so just a really difficult thing that Jesus says maybe the most difficult thing Jesus says in the Bible so at this point even early on in the mission of Jesus you get the sense you get the sense that the kingdom of God is different in the Kingdom of Jesus things will operate differently you will respond differently you will think differently you will not accept the premises that the world has you will operate by kingdom rules and Kingdom standards a kingdom where you lay down your life for your friends and a kingdom where your actions matter but so to the tone of your heart a kingdom where somehow you love your enemy even when everyone says hating is Justified Jesus is authentically resetting the conversation about who our enemies are and how we should treat other humans clearly Jesus is setting the tone no human is ever the enemy our true enemies are Satan and his minions even if that human that we would call an enemy even if that human is being used as a tool of Satan they are still not the enemy they are in fact captives to Satan that are in need of rescue the kingdom of Jesus is very different very different it's entirely different Jesus brings clarity that even when it's Justified to hate an enemy in the kingdom of God it is forbidden to do so in the Kingdom of Jesus you will be expected if you are a citizen of the Kingdom you are expected to love that enemy you might be thinking well hold on a second I thought we were allowed to kill our enemies if it was justified because I think the Old Testament kind of alludes to that I'm not sure how you love your enemy and you kill them at the same time I guarantee you there are people that are trying to figure that out I can give you a shortcut you can't figure that out in fact Jesus is so serious about this he takes it a step further while we were his enemies captive and unable to free ourselves from Satan's power and Dominion Jesus sacrificed his life for his enemies amen he was crucified executed for us so we could be in right relationship with him literally he didn't just not hate us he loved us to the point of giving his life he laid down his life not for his friends but for his future friends what we would call his enemies so if you've been going through life flailing around beating at the wind and not understanding really why everything is so jacked up it's because we are born and raised in a broken and jacked up war zone of a universe and in need of rescue and entry into the kingdom of God that's why it feels so weird because we're supposed to be part of a different Kingdom this is in part the kingdom of God is in part A Spiritual Kingdom but it expresses itself in this world through the citizens of that Kingdom so we advance the kingdom of God amidst us and amongst us and expanded so here's the progression of scripture don't murder people's bodies don't murder people's spirits in fact whatever you think about murder or killing whenever you're thinking about it or just really angry with somebody if you have an enemy instead of murdering their body or their Spirit instead love them you must be kidding right and you're thinking okay you got 12 minutes left Pastor to get me out of this right how do I how do I how do we get out of this one you're not getting out of this one why why do we have to love them why do we get to love them we love them so they may be rescued from the control of our true enemy Satan literally they are our mission that they may be pointed firmly to Jesus Christ because if you hadn't figured it out from Jesus yet life matters life matters to God God in all of its forms life should matter to us friends and foes life matters to God from the womb to the tomb life matters to God wherever we see death and destruction we see the thumbprints of Satan amen that's not from God wherever we see life and proponents of Shalom or biblical peace we see the What's called the imagio day or the image of God we see even if people don't understand it there's a spark of of of God uh within them like calling for life so elderly lives matter and unborn lives matter and black lives matter and poor lives matter and immigrant lives and foreign lives and Jewish lives and Muslim lives and LGBT lives and Democrat lives and Republican lives and death row inmate lives if you hadn't figured it out life matters to God all life matters to [Applause] God now if you take out like one or two of those things inside of what I said people can get really excited about it but you take one or two of those and talk about it in front of some places they're like oh that life doesn't matter it matters and we need to be consistent from the womb to the tomb when there is death and destruction something's wrong life matters and so that's a big ask of Jesus Jesus is asking a lot of us huh so that's nice Jesus walks away from The Sermon on the Mount people are like hoping he never brings it up again you know kind of one of those things maybe if he just says it once we don't have to do it but we're actually in a series on the book of Acts and that's where we're at right now we haven't even read it yet but I'm setting up what's happening the book of Acts is giving us how the early church how the early Christians lived the mission of Jesus how is it that as Christians how is it that those that are interested in becoming Christians how is it that we would follow Jesus in today's world so Jesus has ascended to heaven the Christians are out doing their thing it's one thing we've learned already to lay down your life for a friend or a loved one but what about laying down your life for your enemies how did the early church handle that all your life subtly or overtly you've been told to hate your enemies destroy your enemies alienate your enemies isolate your enemies run away from your enemies ignore your enemies so whenever you get angry with someone whenever you get mad or frustrated with someone what comes out of you is what you have been trained to do your whole life which is to destroy your enemies murder them in your heart however Jesus taught us and showed us that we are to lay down our life for our friends and our future friends know as enemies there was this man named Stephen that was full of grace and power Pastor Jesse talked talked about him a couple weeks ago and whenever he went out and he performed signs and miracles amongst the people throughout Jerusalem a large number of Jews became Believers in Jesus Christ and religious leaders became angry and had him brought and he was talking to them and then verse 54 of Acts 7 it says the Jewish leaders were infuriated by Steven's accusation and they shook their fist at him in Rage verse 57 then they put their hands over their ears and began shouting they rushed out him and dragged him out of the city began to Stone him his accusers took off their coats and laid them at the feet of a young man named Saul don't forget that name as they stoned him Steven prayed Lord Jesus receive my spirit he fell to his knees shouting Lord don't charge them with this sin and with that he died so here we have Stephen so the whole point of the book of Acts the major point of the book of Acts is how are we supposed to do the mission of Jesus you read it then you know what to do Stephen is doing the mission of Jesus by dying for the name of Jesus and notice that as he's dying his thoughts are not thoughts of bitterness towards his attackers but they are thoughts asking God on their behalf to forgive them it's really quite profound in black and white it's just kind of like words on a on a page but when you think and Ponder like this is powerful Stephen knew that these were people in trouble and he was dying well in front of those very people his enemies so that his enemies might have the opportunity to know real love and he's doing it because he's doing exactly what Jesus said to do to love your enemies to lay down your life for your enemies here we see that the very people that were killing him were the very ones that stevenh loved and he was trying to set them free from spiritual blindness and bondage he loved them enough that he was willing to sacrifice his own life his own physical life so that they might be free one of the witnesses and individuals that gave permission and encourag the stoning of Stephen was a man named Saul in verse one of chapter 8 it says Saul was one of the witnesses and he agreed completely with the killing of Stephen Saul would eventually become known as Paul as in St Paul as in the Apostle Paul he would follow in the footsteps of Stephen and follow Jesus Christ eventually the Apostle Paul would change the world he would write most of the New Testament in the Bible and on nearly every single list of the most influential people in human history the Apostle Paul is at the very top Saul was only able to become Paul because Stephen literally laid his life down for Saul who at that time was his enemy executing him there are billions of people throughout history that can trace their faith back to what Paul has helped us to understand about Jesus but if it were not for stepen none of that happens Paul only happens because Stephen loved his enemies and laid his life down for his enemies it's one of the most pivotal pivotable pivotal signature moments in Christian history now there's a couple verses we didn't read earlier in verse 55 just as Steven was being stoned it says but stepen full of the Holy Spirit gazed steadily into heaven and saw the glory of God and he saw Jesus standing in the place of honor at God's right hand and he told them look I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing in the place of honor at God's right hand I want you to get this twice let us know that when stevenh sees Jesus he's standing he's standing at the right hand of the father not sitting everywhere else in the Bible when we see this example Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the father not standing Jesus is doing something different here why is he standing here now there may be a lot of reasons but come with me for a minute I think that at this moment Stephen is looking at Jesus and Jesus is looking at Steph I Think Jesus is standing because Jesus is an active participant in this with Stephen Stephen isn't in this alone it it might look to everyone around that Steph is losing but Jesus knows that Steph is actually winning yeah now this is way way beyond our normal day-to-day life and thinking but if you go back Jesus did this by Jesus dying he was winning and so were we everybody thought he was losing he was winning by Steven dying he was winning and so were his enemies Hallelujah the kingdom is different than everything you've ever been taught about how the world should run the kingdom of God is not the same as the kingdoms of this Earth and virtually none of us would even know of Jesus unless this moment happens because of its connection to Paul Jesus is standing I think because he is rescuing Stephen years earlier we have an example of Jesus showing up to rescue three Jewish young men young men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and in that moment Jesus shows up and he actually protects their Earthly lives in the fiery flames in that moment Jesus shows up to rescue and in this moment with Stephen Jesus once again shows up to rescue but rescue looks different this time this time the rescue will happen as Steven willingly sacrifices his life following the example of Jesus Jesus is standing because he has rescued him from Eternal death already and is now ready to welcome Stephen home it's an interesting picture Jesus I mean Stephen in essence is getting from Jesus a standing ovation Hallelujah he's cheering Stephen on like Stephen you got it you're doing it your sacrifice is going to change the whole world we will talk about it for thousands of years I think about this sometimes is Jesus standing and applauding me is he posting on his Instagram page for the angels and clouds of witnesses to see what I've been up to or is he sitting in his office cringing like no no no no no that's that's not right no that's not what's supposed to happen Kur this time though Stephen he gets it right and Jesus stands up Bravo Stephen Bravo Stephen Bravo Stephen right that's a big deal getting a standing o from Jesus I want a standing ovation from Jesus lay down your life for your enemies oh I can smile doesn't make it go away um today in the United States it may not be required that you actually physically die for your faith but it may require you to be socially or politically or financially assassinated for the sake of and for the love of our enemies who are in fact not our enemies but captives of the one true enemy and they are in need of rescue from Satan as the worship team comes up why don't you stand with me as we close today so how how do you do this how do you walk out the mission of Jesus according to the book of Acts here's here it is one lay down your life for your friends two love your enemies three lay down your life for your enemies I mean that's the standing o from Jesus that's the goal live my life so I'm laying it down for my enemies it probably won't mean your physical life anytime soon but it certainly means the rest of your life why don't you close your eyes and bow your heads just for a moment as we respond and reflect and pray H today if you if you don't know much about Jesus or you're just still exploring who Jesus is and if you want to follow him this Cuts straight to it I mean this this is this is what the kingdom of God is really supposed to be like this is what following Jesus is really supposed to be like it's different it's entirely different and you can't really get your head around it one of the things Jesus does is he laid down his life for us while we were still his enemies so that we might be forgiven of our sins and might ex have his leadership in our life and today if you have never asked Jesus to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life he would love to do that that he would love to forgive you of your sins he would love to lead your life and you can simply ask him today in your own words the worship team will lead us in this last song and as they do why don't you consider is there somebody in your life that you are not loving maybe for you it's I just got to learn how to love my friends right now like loving my enemies is a whole different plane that I'm no nowhere near but for others of you you know exactly what this means you know exactly what it looks like in your life there are people that you need to pray for there are people that you need to forgive there are people that you need to release there are people that you need to live in love at a whole different level and for some of you that might even mean yourself you've been your own enemy for a long time you can love yourself too the altars are open and I just want to encourage you today come spend some time in prayer let's talk to Jesus about this", "this is the gospel of mark chapter one john the baptist prepares the way this is the good news about jesus the messiah the son of god it began just as the prophet isaiah had written look i am sending my messenger ahead of you and he will prepare your way he is a voice shouting in the wilderness prepare the way for the lord's coming clear the road for him this messenger was john the baptist he was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to god to be forgiven all of judea including all the people of jerusalem went out to see and hear john and when they confessed their sins he baptized them in the jordan river his clothes were woven from coarse camel hair and he wore leather belt around his waist for food he ate locusts and wild honey john announced someone is coming soon who is greater than i am so much greater that i'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals i baptize you with water but he will baptize you with the holy spirit the baptism and temptation of jesus one day jesus came from nazareth in galilee and john baptized him in the jordan river as jesus came up out of the water he saw the heavens splitting apart and the holy spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice from heaven said you are my dearly loved son and you bring me great joy the spirit then compelled jesus to go into the wilderness where he was tempted by satan for forty days he was out among the wild animals and angels took care of him later on after john was arrested jesus went into galilee where he preached god's good news the time promised by god has come at last he announced the kingdom of god is near repent of your sins and believe the good news the first disciples one day as jesus was walking along the shore of the sea of galilee he saw simon and his brother andrew throwing a net into the water for they fished for a living jesus called out to them come follow me and i will show you how to fish for people and they left their nets at once and followed him a little farther up the shore jesus saw zebedee's sons james and john in a boat repairing their nets he called them at once and they also followed him leaving their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men jesus casts out an evil spirit jesus and his companions went to the town of capernaum when the sabbath day came he went into the synagogue and began to teach the people were amazed at his teaching for he taught with real authority quite unlike the teachers of religious law suddenly a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit began shouting why are you interfering with us jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you are the holy one of god jesus cut him short be quiet come out of the man he ordered at that the evil spirit screamed threw the man into a convulsion and then came out of him amazement gripped the audience and they began to discuss what had happened what sort of new teaching is this they asked excitedly it has such authority even evil spirits obey his orders the news about jesus spread quickly throughout the entire region of galilee jesus heals many people after jesus left the synagogue with james and john they went to simon and andrew's home now simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever they told jesus about her right away so he went to her bedside took her by the hand and helped her sit up then the fever left her and she prepared a meal for them that evening after sunset many sick and demon-possessed people were brought to jesus the whole town gathered at the door to watch so jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases and he cast out many demons but because the demons knew who he was he did not allow them to speak jesus preaches in galilee before daybreak the next morning jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray later simon and the others went out to find him when they found him they said everyone is looking for you but jesus replied we must go on to other towns as well and i will preach to them too that is why i came so he traveled throughout the region of galilee preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons jesus heals a man with leprosy a man with leprosy came and knelt in front of jesus begging to be healed if you are willing you can heal me and make me clean he said moved with compassion jesus reached out and touched him i am willing he said be healed instantly the leprosy disappeared and the man was healed then jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning don't tell anyone about this instead go to the priest and let him examine you take along the offering required in the law of moses for those who have been healed of leprosy this will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed but the man went and spread the word proclaiming to everyone what had happened as a result large crowds soon surrounded jesus and he couldn't publicly enter a town anywhere he had to stay out in the secluded places but people from everywhere kept coming to him chapter 2 jesus heals a paralyzed man when jesus returned to capernaum several days later the news spread quickly that he was back home soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room even outside the door while he was preaching god's word to them four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat they couldn't bring him to jesus because of the crowd so they dug a hole through the roof above his head then they lowered the man on his mat right down in front of jesus seeing their faith jesus said to the paralyzed man my child your sins are forgiven but some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves what is he saying this is blasphemy only god can forgive sins jesus knew immediately what they were thinking so he asked them why do you question this in your hearts is it easier to say to the paralyzed man your sins are forgiven or stand up pick up your mat and walk so i will prove to you that the son of man has the authority on earth to forgive sins then jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said stand up pick up your mat and go home and the man jumped up grabbed his mat and walked out through the stunned onlookers they were all amazed and praised god exclaiming we've never seen anything like this before jesus calls levi or matthew then jesus went out to the lake shore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him as he walked along he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at his tax collector's booth follow me and be my disciple jesus said to him so levi got up and followed him later levi invited jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners there were many people of this kind among jesus followers but when the teachers of religious law who were pharisees saw him eating with the tax collectors and other sinners they asked his disciples why does he eat with such scum when jesus heard this he told them healthy people don't need a doctor sick people do i have come to call not those who think they are righteous but those who know they are sinners a discussion about fasting once when john's disciples and the pharisees were fasting some people came to jesus and asked why don't your disciples fast like john's disciples and the pharisees do jesus replied do wedding guests fast while celebrating with a groom of course not they can't fast while the groom is with them but someday the groom will be taken away from them and then they will fast besides who would patch old clothing with new cloth the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth leaving an even bigger tear than before and no one puts new wine into old wineskins for the wine would burst the wineskins and the wine and the skins would both be lost new wine calls for new wine skins a discussion about the sabbath one sabbath day as jesus was walking through some grain fields his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat but the pharisees said to jesus look why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the sabbath jesus said to them haven't you ever read in the scriptures what david did when he and his companions were hungry he went into the house of god during the days when abiathar was high priest and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat he also gave some to his companions and jesus said to them the sabbath was made to meet the needs of people and not people to meet the requirements of the sabbath so the son of man is lord even over the sabbath chapter 3 jesus heals on the sabbath jesus went into the synagogue again and noticed a man with a deformed hand since it was the sabbath jesus enemies watched him closely if he healed the man's hand they planned to accuse him of working on the sabbath jesus said to the man with the deformed hand come and stand in front of everyone then he turned to his critics and asked does the law permit good dates on the sabbath or is it a day for doing evil is this a day to save life or to destroy it but they wouldn't answer him he looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts then he said to the man hold out your hand so the man held out his hand and it was restored at once the pharisees went away and met with the supporters of herod to plot how to kill jesus crowds follow jesus jesus went out to the lake with his disciples and a large crowd followed him they came from all over galilee judea jerusalem edemaya from east of the jordan river and even from as far north as tyre and sidon the news about his miracles had spread far and wide and vast numbers of people came to see him jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him he had healed many people that day so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him and whenever those possessed by evil spirits caught sight of him the spirit would throw them to the ground in front of him shrieking you are the son of god but jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was jesus chooses the 12 apostles afterward jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him and they came to him then he appointed 12 of them and called them his apostles they were to accompany him and he would send them out to preach giving them authority to cast out demons these are the twelve he chose simon whom he named peter james and john the sons of zebedee but jesus nicknamed them sons of thunder andrew philip bartholomew matthew thomas james son of alphaeus thaddeus simon the zealot judas iscariot who later betrayed him jesus and the prince of demons one time jesus entered a house and the crowds began to gather again soon he and his disciples couldn't even find time to eat when his family heard what was happening they tried to take him away he's out of his mind they said but the teachers of religious law who had arrived from jerusalem said he's possessed by satan the prince of demons that's where he gets the power to cast out demons jesus called them over and responded with an illustration how can satan cast out satan he asked a kingdom divided by civil war will collapse similarly a family splintered by feuding will fall apart and if satan is divided and fights against himself how can he stand he would never survive let me illustrate this further who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man like satan and plunder his goods only someone even stronger someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house i tell you the truth all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven but anyone who blasphemes the holy spirit will never be forgiven this is a sin with eternal consequences he told them this because they were saying he's possessed by an evil spirit the true family of jesus then jesus mother and brothers came to see him they stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them there was a crowd sitting around jesus and someone said your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you jesus replied who is my mother who are my brothers then he looked at those around him and said look these are my mother and brothers anyone who does god's will is my brother and sister and mother chapter 4 parable of the farmer scattering sea once again jesus began teaching by the lakeshore a very large crowd soon gathered around him so he got into a boat then he sat in the boat with all the people that remained on the shore he taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables such as this one listen a farmer went out to plant some seed as he scattered it across his field some of the seed fell on a footpath and the birds came and ate it other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock the seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow but the plant soon wilted under the sun and since it didn't have deep roots it died other seed fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain still other seed fell on fertile soil and they sprouted grew and produced a crop that was 30 60 and even a hundred times as much as had been planted then he said anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand later when jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around they asked him what the parables meant he replied you are permitted to understand the secret of the kingdom of god but i use parables for everything i say to outsiders so that the scriptures might be fulfilled when they see what i do they will learn nothing when they hear what i say they will not understand otherwise they will turn to me and be forgiven then jesus said to them if you can't understand the meaning of this parable how will you understand all the other parables the farmer plants seeds by taking god's word to others the seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message only to have satan comment once and take it away the seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy but since they don't have deep roots they don't last long they fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing god's word the sea that fell among the thorns represents others who hear god's word but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life the lure of wealth and the desire for other things so no fruit is produced and the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept god's word and produce a harvest of 30 60 or even 100 times as much as had been planted parable of the lamp then jesus asked them would anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed of course not a lamp is placed on a stand where its light will shine for everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open and every secret will be brought to light anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand then he added pay close attention to what you hear the closer you listen the more understanding you will be given and you will receive even more to those who listen to my teaching more understanding will be given but for those who are not listening even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them parable of growing seed jesus also said the kingdom of god is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground night and day while he's asleep or awake the seed sprouts and grows but he does not understand how it happens the earth produces the crops on its own first a leaf blade pushes through then the heads of wheat are formed and finally the grain ripens and as soon as the grain is ready the farmer comes and harvests it with a sickle for the harvest time has come the parable of the mustard seed jesus said how can i describe the kingdom of god what story should i use to illustrate it it is like a mustard seed planted in the ground it is the smallest of all seeds but it becomes the largest of all garden plants it grows long branches and birds can make their nests in its shade jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand in fact in his public ministry he never taught without using parables but afterward when he was alone with his disciples he explained everything to them jesus calms the storm as evening came jesus said to his disciples let's cross to the other side of the lake so they took jesus in the boat and started out leaving the crowds behind although other boats followed but soon a fierce storm came up high waves were breaking into the boat and it began to fill with water jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion the disciples woke him up shouting teacher don't you care that we're going to drown when jesus woke up he rebuked the wind and said to the waves silence be still suddenly the wind stopped and there was a great calm then he asked them why are you afraid do you still have no faith the disciples were absolutely terrified who is this man they asked each other even the wind and waves obey him chapter 5 jesus heals a demon-possessed man so they arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the gerasenes when jesus climbed out of the boat a man possessed by an evil spirit came out from a cemetery to meet him this man lived among the burial caves and could no longer be restrained even with a chain whenever he was put into chains and shackles as he often was he snapped the chains from his wrists and smashed the shackles no one was strong enough to subdue him day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills howling and cutting himself with sharp stones when jesus was still some distance away the man saw him ran to meet him and bowed low before him with a shriek he screamed why are you interfering with me jesus son of the most high god in the name of god i beg you don't torture me for jesus had already said to the spirit come out of the man you evil spirit then jesus demanded what is your name and he replied my name is legion because there are many of us inside this man then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place there happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby send us into those pigs the spirit begged let us enter them so jesus gave them permission the evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs and the entire herd of about 2 000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water the herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside spreading the news as they ran people rushed out to see what had happened a crowd soon gathered around jesus and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons he was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane and they were all afraid then those who had seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs and the crowd began pleading with jesus to go away and leave them alone as jesus was getting into the boat the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him but jesus said no go home to your family and tell them everything the lord has done for you and how merciful he has been so the man started off to visit the 10 towns of that region and he began to proclaim the great things jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed at why he told them jesus heals in response to faith jesus got into the boat again and went back to the other side of the lake where a large crowd gathered around him on the shore then a leader of the local synagogue whose name was jairus arrived when he saw jesus he fell at his feet pleading fervently with him my little daughter is dying he said please come and lay your hands on her heal her so she can live jesus went with him and all the people followed crowding around him a woman in the crowd had suffered for 12 years with constant bleeding she had suffered a great deal for many doctors and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them she had gotten no better in fact she had gotten worse she heard about jesus so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe for she thought to herself if i can just touch his robe i will be healed immediately the bleeding stopped and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him so he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my robe his disciples said to him look at this crowd pressing around you how can you ask who touched me but he kept on looking around to see who had done it and then the frightened woman trembling at the realization of what had happened to her came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace your suffering is over while he was still speaking to her messengers arrived from the home of jairus the leader of the synagogue they told him your daughter is dead there's no use troubling the teacher now but jesus overheard them and said to jairus don't be afraid just have faith then jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn't let anyone go with him except peter james and john the brother of james when they came to the home of the synagogue leader jesus saw much commotion and weeping and wailing he went inside and asked why all this commotion and weeping child isn't dead she's only asleep the crowd laughed at him but he made them all leave and he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying holding her hand he said to her talitha com which means little girl get up and the girl who was 12 years old immediately stood up and walked around they were overwhelmed and totally amazed jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened and then he told them to give her something to eat chapter 6 jesus rejected and nazareth jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to nazareth his hometown the next sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue and many who heard him were amazed they asked where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles then they scoffed he's just a carpenter the son of mary and brother of james joseph judas and simon and his sisters live right here among us they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him then jesus told them a prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and among his relatives and his own family because of their unbelief he couldn't do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them and he was amazed at their unbelief jesus sends out the twelve disciples then jesus went from village to village teaching the people and he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two giving them authority to cast out evil spirits he told them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick no food no traveler's bag no money he allowed them to wear sandals but not to take a change of clothes wherever you go he said stay in the same house until you leave town but if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate so the disciples went out telling everyone they meant to repent of their sins and turn to god and they cast out many demons and healed many sick people anointing them with olive oil the death of john the baptist herod antipas the king soon heard about jesus because everyone was talking about him some were saying this must be john the baptist raised from the dead that is why he could do such miracles others said he's the prophet elijah still some others said he's a prophet like the other great prophets of the past when herod heard about jesus he said john the man i beheaded has come back from the dead for herod had sent soldiers to arrest and imprisoned jon as a favor to herodias she had been his brother philip's wife but herod had married her john had been telling herod it is against god's law for you to marry your brother's wife so herodias bore a grudge against john and wanted to kill him but without herod's approval she was powerless for herod respected john and knowing that he was a good and holy man he protected him herod was greatly disturbed whenever he talked with john but even so he liked to listen to him herodius's chance finally came on herod's birthday he gave a party for his high government officials army officers and the leading citizens of galilee then his daughter also named herodius came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased herod and his guests ask me for anything you like the king said to the girl and i will give it to you he even vowed i will give you whatever you ask up to half my kingdom she went out and asked her mother what should i ask for her mother told her ask for the head of john the baptist so the girl hurried back to the king and told him i want the head of john the baptist right now on a tray then the king deeply regretted what he had said but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests he couldn't refuse her so he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off john's head and bring it to him the soldier beheaded john in the prison brought his head on a tray and gave it to the girl who took it to her mother when john's disciples heard what had happened they came to get his body and buried it in a tomb jesus feeds five thousand the apostles returned to jesus from their ministry tour and told him all they had done and taught then jesus said let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest a while he said this because there were so many people coming and going that jesus and his apostles didn't even have time to eat so they left by boat for a quiet place where they could be alone but many people recognized them and saw them leaving and the people from many towns ran ahead along the shore and got there ahead of them jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd so he began teaching them many things late in the afternoon his disciples came to him and said this is a remote place and it's already getting late send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat but jesus said you feed them with what they asked we'd have to work for months to earn enough money to buy food for all these people how much bread do you have he asked go and find out they came back and reported we have five loaves of bread and two fish then jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass so they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred jesus took the five loaves and two fish looked up toward heaven and blessed them then breaking the loaves into pieces he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people he also divided the fish for everyone to share they all ate as much as they wanted and afterward the disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover bread and fish a total of 5 000 men and their families were fed jesus walks on water immediately after this jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to bethsaida while he sent the people home after telling everyone goodbye he went up into the hills by himself to pray late that night the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake and jesus was alone on land he saw that they were in serious trouble rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves about three o'clock in the morning jesus came toward them walking on the water he intended to go past them but when they saw him walking on the water they cried out in terror thinking he was a ghost they were all terrified when they saw him but jesus spoke to them at once don't be afraid he said take courage i am here then he climbed into the boat and the wind stopped they were totally amazed for they still didn't understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves their hearts were too hard to take it in after they'd crossed the lake they landed at ganesaret they brought the boat to shore and climbed down the people recognized jesus at once and they ran throughout the whole area carrying sick people on mats to when wherever they heard he was wherever he went in villages cities or the countryside they brought the sick out to the marketplaces they begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe and all who touched him were healed chapter 7 jesus teaches about inner purity one day some pharisees and teachers of religious law arrived from jerusalem to see jesus they noticed that some of his disciples failed to follow the jewish ritual of hand washing before eating the jews especially the pharisees do not eat until they have poured water over their cupped hands as required by their ancient traditions similarly they don't eat anything from the market until they immerse their hands in water this is but one of many traditions they have clung to such as their ceremonial washing of cups pitchers and kettles so the pharisees and teachers of religious law asked him why don't your disciples follow our age-old traditions they eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony jesus replied you hypocrites isaiah was right when he prophesied about you for he wrote these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me their worship is a farce for they teach man-made ideas as commands from god for you ignore god's law and substitute your own tradition then he said you skillfully sidestep god's law in order to hold on to your own tradition for instance moses gave you this law from god honor your father and mother and anyone who speaks disrespectfully a father or mother must be put to death but you say it is all right for people to say to their parents sorry i can't help you for i vowed to give to god what i would have given to you in this way you let them disregard their needy parents and so you cancel the word of god in order to hand down your own tradition and this is only one example of many others then jesus called to the crowd to come and hear all of you listen he said and try to understand it's not what goes into your body that defiles you you are defiled by what comes from your heart then jesus went into a house to get away from the crowd and his disciples asked him what he meant by the parable he had just used don't you understand either he asked can't you see that the food you put into your body cannot defile you food doesn't go into your heart but only passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer by saying this he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in god's eyes and then he added it is what comes from inside that defiles you for from within out of a person's heart come evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder adultery greed wickedness deceit lustful desires envy slander pride and foolishness all these vile things come from within they are what defiles you the faith of a gentile woman then jesus left galilee and went north to the region of tyre he didn't want anyone to know which house he was staying in but he couldn't keep it a secret right away a woman who had heard about him came and fell at his feet her little girl was possessed by an evil spirit and she begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter since she was a gentile born in syrian phoenicia jesus told her first i should feed the children my own family the jews it isn't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs she replied that's true lord but even the dogs under the table are allowed to eat the scraps from the children's plates good answer he said now go home for the demon has left your daughter and when she arrived home she found her little girl lying quietly in bed and the demon was gone jesus heals a deaf man jesus left tyre and went up to sidon before going back to the sea of galilee in the region of the ten towns a deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him and people begged jesus to lay his hands on the man to heal him jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone he put his fingers into the man's ears then spitting on his own fingers he touched the man's tongue looking up to heaven he sighed and said ephitha which means be opened instantly the man could hear perfectly and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly jesus told the crowd not to tell anyone but the more he told them not to the more they spread the news they were completely amazed and said again and again everything he does is wonderful he even makes the deaf to hear and give speech to those who cannot speak chapter eight jesus feeds four thousand about this time another large crowd had gathered and the people ran out of food again jesus called his disciples and told them i feel sorry for these people they've been here with me for three days and they have nothing left to eat if i send them home hungry they will faint along the way for some of them have come a long distance his disciples replied how are we supposed to find enough food to feed them out here in the wilderness jesus asked how much bread do you have seven loaves they replied so jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground then he took the seven loaves thanked god for them and broke them into pieces he gave them to his disciples who distributed the bread to the crowd a few small fish were found too so jesus also blessed these and told the disciples to distribute them they ate as much as they wanted afterward the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food there were about four thousand people in the crowd that day and jesus sent them home after they had eaten immediately after this he got into a boat with his disciples and crossed over to the region of delmanutha pharisees demand a miraculous sign when the pharisees heard that jesus had arrived they came and started to argue with him testing him they demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority when he heard this he sighed deeply in his spirit and said why do these people keep demanding a miraculous sign i tell you the truth i will not give this generation any such sign so he got back into the boat and left them and he crossed to the other side of the lake yeast of the pharisees and herod but the disciples had forgotten to bring any food they had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat as they were crossing the lake jesus warned them watch out beware of the yeast of the pharisees and of herod at this they begin to argue with each other because they hadn't brought any bread jesus knew what they were saying so he said why are you arguing about having no bread don't you know or understand even yet are your hearts too hard to take it in you have eyes can't you see you have ears can't you hear don't you remember anything at all when i fed the 5000 with five loaves of bread how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward 12 they said and when i fed the 4 000 with seven loaves how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up seven they said don't you understand yet he asked them jesus heals a blind man when they arrived at bethsaida some people brought a blind man to jesus and they begged him to touch the man and heal him jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village then spitting on the man's eyes he laid his hands on him and said can you see anything now the men looked around yes he said i see people but i can't see them very clearly they look like trees walking around then jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again and his eyes were opened his sight was completely restored and he could see everything clearly jesus sent him away saying don't go back into the village on your way home peter's declaration about jesus jesus and his disciples left galilee and went up to the villages near caesarea philippi as they were walking along he asked them who do people say i am well they replied some say john the baptist some say elijah and others say that you're one of the other prophets then he asked them but who do you say i am peter replied you are the messiah but jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him jesus predicts his death then jesus began to tell them that the son of man must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders the leading priests and the teachers of religious law he would be killed but three days later he would rise from the dead as he talked about this openly with his disciples peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things jesus turned around and looked at his disciples and then reprimanded peter get away from me satan he said you are seeing things merely from a human point of view not from gods then calling the crowd to join his disciples he said if any of you wants to be my follower you must turn from your selfish ways take up your cross and follow me if you try to hang on to your life you will lose it but if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the good news you will save it and what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul is anything worth more than your soul if anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days the son of man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his father with the holy angels chapter 9 jesus went on to say i tell you the truth some standing here right now will not die before they see the kingdom of god arrive in great power the transfiguration six days later jesus took peter james and john and led them up a high mountain to be alone as the men watched jesus appearance was transformed and his clothes became dazzling white far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them then elijah and moses appeared and began talking with jesus peter exclaimed rabbi it's wonderful for us to be here let's make three shelters as memorials one for you one for moses and one for elijah he said this because he didn't really know what else to say for they were all terrified then a cloud overshadowed them and a voice from the cloud said this is my dearly loved son listened to him suddenly when they looked around moses and elijah were gone and they saw only jesus with them as they went back down the mountain he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the son of man had arisen from the dead so they kept it to themselves but they often asked each other what he meant by rising from the dead then they asked him why do the teachers of religious law insist that elijah must return before the messiah comes jesus responded elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready yet why do the scriptures say that the son of man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt but i tell you elijah has already come and they chose to abuse him just as the scriptures predicted jesus heals a", " demon-possessed boy when they returned to the other disciples they saw a large crowd surrounding them and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them when the crowd saw jesus they were overwhelmed with awe and they ran to greet him what is all this arguing about jesus asked one of the men in the crowd spoke up and said teacher i brought my son so you could heal him he's possessed by an evil spirit that won't let him talk and whenever the spirit sees him it throws him violently to the ground then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid so i asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit but they couldn't do it jesus said to them you faithless people how long must i be with you how long must i put up with you bring the boy to me so they brought the boy but when the evil spirit saw jesus it threw the child into a violent convulsion and he fell to the ground writhing and foaming at the mouth how long has this been happening jesus asked the boy's father he replied since he was a little boy the spirit often throws him into the fire into water trying to kill him have mercy on us and help us if you can what do you mean if i can jesus asked anything is possible if a person believes the father instantly cried out i do believe but help me overcome my unbelief when jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing he rebuked the evil spirit listen you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak he said i command you to come out of this child and never enter him again and the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him the boy appeared to be dead a murmur ran through the crowd as people said he's dead but jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet and he stood up afterward when jesus was alone in the house with his disciples they asked him why couldn't we cast out that evil spirit jesus replied this kind can be cast out only by prayer jesus again predicts his death leaving that region they traveled through galilee jesus didn't want anyone to know he was there for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them he said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies he will be killed but three days later he will rise from the dead they didn't understand what he was saying however and they were afraid to ask him what he meant the greatest in the kingdom after they arrived at capernaum and settled in a house jesus asked his disciples what were you discussing out on the road but they didn't answer because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest he sat down called the twelve disciples over to him and he said whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else then he put a little child among them taking the child in his arms he said to them anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf welcomes me and anyone who welcomes me welcomes not only me but also my father who sent me using the name of jesus john said to jesus teacher we saw someone using your name to cast out demons but we told him to stop because he wasn't in our group don't stop him jesus said no one who performs a miracle in my name will soon be able to speak evil of me anyone who is not against us is for us if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the messiah i tell you the truth that person will surely be rewarded but if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck if your hand causes you to sin cut it off it's better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell with two hands if your foot causes you to sin cut it off it is better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet and if your eye causes you to sin gouge it out it's better to enter the kingdom of god with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out for everyone will be tested with fire salt is good for seasoning but if it loses its flavor how do you make it salty again you must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other chapter 10 discussion about divorce and marriage then jesus left capernaum and went down to the region of judea and into the area east of the jordan river once again crowds gathered around him and as usual he was teaching them some pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question should a man be allowed to divorce his wife jesus answered them with a question what did moses say in the law about divorce well he permitted it they replied he said a man can give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away but jesus responded he wrote this commandment only as a concession to your hard hearts but god made them male and female from the beginning of creation this explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife and the two are united into one since they are no longer two but one let no one split apart what god has joined together later when he was alone with his disciples in the house they brought up the subject again he told them whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery against her and if a woman divorces her husband and marries someone else she commits adultery jesus blesses the children one day some parents brought their children to jesus so he could touch and bless them the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him when jesus saw what was happening he was angry with his disciples he said to them let the children come to me don't stop them for the kingdom of god belongs to those who are like these children i tell you the truth anyone who doesn't receive the kingdom of god like a child will never enter it then he took the children and in his arms and placed his hands on their heads and blessed them the rich man as jesus was starting out on his way to jerusalem a man came running up to him knelt down and asked good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life why do you call me good jesus asked only god is truly good but to answer your question you know the commandments you must not murder you must not commit adultery you must not steal you must not testify falsely you must not cheat anyone honor your father and mother teacher the man replied i've obeyed all these commandments since i was young looking at the man jesus felt genuine love for him there is still one thing you haven't done he told him go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me at this the man's face fell and he went away sad for he had many possession jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god this amazed them but jesus said again dear children it is very hard to enter the kingdom of god in fact it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of god the disciples were astounded then who in the world can be saved they asked jesus looked at them intently and said humanly speaking it is impossible but now with god everything is possible with god then peter began to speak up we've given up everything to follow you he said yes jesus replied and i assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property for my sake and for the good news will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses brothers sisters mothers children and property along with persecution and in the world to come that person will have eternal life but many who are the greatest now will be least important then and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then jesus again predicts his death they were now on the way up to jerusalem and jesus was walking ahead of them the disciples were filled with awe and the people following behind were overwhelmed with fear taking the twelve disciples aside jesus once more began to describe everything that was about to happen to him listen he said we're going up to jerusalem where the son of man will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law they will sentence him to die and hand him over to the romans they will mock him spit on him flog him with a whip and kill him but after three days he will rise again jesus teaches about serving others then james and john the sons of zebedee came over and spoke to him teacher they said we want you to do us a favor what is your request he asked they replied when you sit on your glorious throne we want to sit in places of honor next to you one on your right and the other on your left but jesus said to them you don't know what you're asking are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering i'm about to drink are you able to be baptized with a baptism of suffering i must be baptized with oh yes they replied we are able but then jesus told them you will indeed drink from my bitter cup and be baptized with the baptism of suffering but i have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left god has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen then the ten other disciples heard what james and john had asked they were indignant so jesus called them together and said you know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people and officials flaunt their authority over those under them but among you it will be different whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else for even the son of man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many jesus heals blind bartimaeus then they reached jericho and as jesus and his disciples left town a large crowd followed him a blind beggar named bartimaeus son of timaeus was sitting beside the road when bartimaeus heard that jesus of nazareth was nearby he began to shout jesus son of david have mercy on me be quiet many of the people yelled at him but he only shouted louder son of david have mercy on me when jesus heard him he stopped and said tell him to come here so they called the blind man cheer up they said come on he's calling you bartimaeus threw aside his coat jumped up and came to jesus what do you want me to do for you jesus asked my rabbi the blind man said i want to see and jesus said to him go for your faith has healed you instantly the man could see and he followed jesus down the road chapter 11 jesus triumphant entry as jesus and his disciples approached jerusalem they came to the towns of bethphage in bethany on the mount of olives jesus sent two of them on ahead go into that village over there he told them as soon as you enter it you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden untie it and bring it here if anyone asks what are you doing just say the lord needs it and will return it soon the two disciples left and found the cult standing in the street tied outside the front door as they were untying it some bystanders demanded what are you doing untying that cult they said what jesus told them to say and they were permitted to take it then they brought the cult to jesus and threw their garments over it and he sat on it many in the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him and others spread leafy branches they had cut in the fields jesus was in the center of the procession and the people all around him were shouting praise god blessings on the one who comes in the name of the lord blessings on the coming kingdom of our ancestor david praised god in the highest heaven so jesus came to jerusalem and went into the temple after looking around carefully at everything he left because it was late in the afternoon then he returned to bethany with the twelve disciples jesus curses the fig tree the next morning as they were leaving bethany jesus was hungry he noticed a fig tree and full leaf a little way off so he went over to see if he could find any fakes but there were only leaves because it was too early in the season for fruit then jesus said to the tree may no one ever eat your fruit again and the disciples heard him say it jesus clears the temple when they arrived back in jerusalem jesus entered the temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices he knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves and he stopped everyone from using the temple as a marketplace he said to them the scriptures declare my temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations but you have turned it into a den of thieves when the leading priests and teachers of religious law heard what jesus had done they began planning how to kill him they were afraid of him because the people were so amazed at his teaching that evening jesus and the disciples left the city the next morning as they passed by the fig tree he had cursed the disciples noticed it had withered from the roots up peter remembered what jesus had said to the tree on the previous day and exclaimed look rabbi the fig tree you cursed has withered and died and jesus said to the disciples have faith in god i tell you the truth you can say to this mountain may you be lifted up and thrown into the sea and it will happen but you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart i tell you you can pray for anything and if you believe that you've received it it will be yours but when you are praying first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against so that your father in heaven will forgive your sins too the authority of jesus challenged again they entered jerusalem as jesus was walking through the temple area the leading priests the teachers of religious law and the elders came up to him they demanded by what authority are you doing all these things who gave you the right to do them i'll tell you by what authority i do these things if you answer one question jesus replied did john's authority to baptize come from heaven or was it merely human answer me they talked it over among themselves if we say it was from heaven he'll ask why we didn't believe john but do we dare say it was merely human they were afraid of what people would do because everyone believed that john was a prophet so they finally replied we don't know and jesus replied then i won't tell you by what authority i do these things chapter 12 parable of the evil farmers then jesus began teaching them with stories a man planted a vineyard he built a wall around it dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice and built a lookout tower then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country at the time of the grape harvest he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop but the farmers grabbed the servant beat him up and sent him back empty-handed the owner then sent another servant but they insulted him and beat him over the head the next servant he sent was killed others he sent were either beaten or killed until there was only one left his son whom he loved dearly the owner finally sent him thinking surely they will respect my son but the tenant farmers said to one another here comes the heir to this estate let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves so they grabbed him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard what do you suppose the owner of this vineyard will do jesus asked i'll tell you he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others didn't you ever read this in the scriptures the stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone this is the lord's doing and it is wonderful to see the religious leaders wanted to arrest jesus because they realized that he was telling the story against them they were the wicked farmers but they were afraid of the crowd so they left him and went away taxes for caesar later the leader sent some pharisees and supporters of herod to trap jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested teacher they said we know how honest you are you are impartial and don't play favorites you teach the way of god truthfully now tell us is it right to pay taxes to caesar or not should we pay them or shouldn't we jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said why are you trying to trap me show me a roman coin and i'll tell you when they handed it to him he said whose picture and title are stamped on it caesars they replied well then jesus said give to caesar what belongs to caesar and give to god what belongs to god his reply completely amazed them discussion about resurrection then jesus was approached by some sadducees religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead they posed this question teacher moses gave us a law that if a man dies leaving a wife without children his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name well suppose there were seven brothers the oldest one married and then died without children so the second brother married the widow but he also died without children then the third brother married her this continued with all seven men and still there were no children last of all the woman also died so tell us whose wife will she be in the resurrection for all seven were married to her jesus replied your mistake is that you don't know the scriptures and you don't know the power of god for when the dead rise they will neither marry nor be given in marriage in this respect they will be like the angels in heaven but now as to whether the dead will be raised haven't you ever read about this in the writings of moses in the story of the burning bush long after abraham isaac and jacob had died god said to moses i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob so he is the god of the living not the dead you have made a serious error the most important commandment one of the teachers of religious law was standing there listening to the debate he realized that jesus had answered well so he asked of all the commitments which is the most important jesus replied the most important commandment is this listen o israel the lord our god is the one and only lord and you must love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul all your mind and all your strength the second is equally important love your neighbor as yourself no other commandment is greater than these the teacher of religious law replied well said teacher you have spoken the truth by saying that there is only one god and no other and i know it is important to love him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength and to love my neighbor as myself this is more important than to offer all the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law realizing how much the man understood jesus said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god and after that no one dared to ask him any more question whose son is the messiah later as jesus was teaching the people in the temple he asked why do the teachers of religious law claim that the messiah is the son of david for david himself speaking under the inspiration of the holy spirit said the lord said to my lord sit in the place of honor at my right hand until i humble your enemies beneath your feet so david himself called the messiah my lord how can the messiah be his son the large crowd listened to him with great delight jesus also taught beware of these teachers of religious law for they like to parade around in flowing robes and receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces and how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property they pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public because of this they will be more severely punished the widow's offering jesus sat down near the collection box in the temple and watched as the crowds dropped in their money many rich people put in large amounts then a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins jesus called his disciples to him and said i tell you the truth this poor widow has given more than all the others who are making contributions for they gave a tiny part of their surplus but she poor she is has given everything she had to live on chapter 13 jesus foretells the future as jesus was leaving the temple that day one of his disciples said teacher look at these magnificent buildings look at the impressive stones in the walls jesus replied yes look at these great buildings but they will be completely demolished not one stone will be left on top of another later jesus sat on the mount of olives across the valley from the temple peter james john and andrew came to him privately and asked him tell us when will all this happen what sign will show us that these things are about to be fulfilled jesus replied don't let anyone mislead you for many will come in my name claiming i am the messiah they will deceive many and you'll hear of wars and threats of wars but don't panic yes these things must take place but the end won't follow immediately nation will go to war against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in many parts of the world as well as famines but this is only the first of the birth pains with more to come when these things begin to happen watch out you'll be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues you will stand trial before governors and kings because you're my followers but this will be your opportunity to tell them about me for the good news must first be preached to all nations but when you are arrested and stand trial don't worry in advance about what to say just say what god tells you at that time for it is not you who will be speaking but the holy spirit a brother will betray his brother to death a father will betray his own child and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed and everyone will hate you because you are my followers but the one who endures to the end will be saved the day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration standing where he should not be reader pay attention then those in judea must flee to the hills a person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack a person out in the field must not return even to get a coat how terrible it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days and pray that your flight will not be in the winter for there will be greater anguish in those days than at any time since god created the world and it will never be so great again in fact unless the lord shortens that time of calamity not a single person will survive but for the sake of his chosen ones he has already shortened those days then if anyone tells you look here's the messiah or there he is don't believe it for false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive if possible even god's chosen ones watch out i have warned you about this ahead of time at that time after the anguish of these days the sun will be darkened the moon will give no light the stars will fall from the sky and the powers in the heavens will be shaken then everyone will see the son of man coming on the clouds with great power and glory and he will send out his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the world from the farthest ends of the earth in heaven now learn a lesson from the fig tree when its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout you know that summer is near in the same way when you see all these things taking place you can know that his return is very near right at the door i tell you the truth this generation will not pass from the scene before all these things take place heaven and earth will disappear but my words will never disappear however no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen not even the angels in heaven or the son himself only the father knows and since you don't know when that time will come be on guard stay alert the coming of the son of man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip when he left home he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return you too must keep watch if you don't know when the master of the household will return in the evening at midnight before dawn or at daybreak don't let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning i say to you what i say to everyone watch for him chapter 14 jesus anointed at bethany it was now two days before passover and the festival of unleavened bread the leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture jesus secretly and kill him but not during the passover celebration they agreed or the people may riot meanwhile jesus was in bethany at the home of simon a man who had previously had leprosy while he was eating a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard she broke open the jar and poured the perfume over his head some of those at the table were indignant why waste such expensive perfume they asked it could have been sold for years wages and the money given to the poor so they scolded her harshly but jesus replied leave her alone why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me you will always have the poor among you and you can help them whenever you want to but you will not always have me she has done what she could and has anointed my body for burial ahead of time i tell you the truth wherever the good news is preached throughout the world this woman's deed will be remembered and discussed judas agrees to betray jesus then judas iscariot one of the twelve disciples went to the leading priests to arrange to betray jesus to them they were delighted when they heard why he had come and they promised to give him money so he began looking for an opportunity to betray jesus the last supper on the first day of the festival of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is sacrificed jesus disciples asked him where do you want us to go to prepare the passover meal for you so jesus sent two of them into jerusalem with these instructions as you go into the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you follow him at the house he enters say to the owner the teacher asks where is the guest room where i can eat the passover meal with my disciples he will take you upstairs to a large room that's already set up that is where you should prepare our meal so the two disciples went into the city and found everything just as jesus had said and they prepared the passover meal there in the evening jesus arrived with the twelve as they were at the table eating jesus said i tell you the truth one of you eating with me here will betray me greatly distressed each one asked in turn am i the one he replied it is one of you 12 who is eating from this bowl with me for the son of man must die as the scriptures declared long ago but how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him it would be far better for that man if he had never been born as they were eating jesus took some bread and blessed it then he broke it in pieces and gave it to his disciples saying take it for this is my body and he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to god for it he gave it to them and they all drank from it and he said to them this is my blood which confirms the covenant between god and his people it is poured out as a sacrifice for many i tell you the truth i will not drink wine again until the day i drink it new in the kingdom of god then they sang a hymn and went out to the mount of olives jesus predicts peter's denial on the way jesus told them all of you will desert me for the scriptures say god will strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter but after i'm raised from the dead i will go ahead of you to galilee and meet you there peter said to him even if everyone else deserts you i never will jesus replied i tell you the truth peter this very night before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times that you even know me no peter declared emphatically even if i have to die with you i'll never deny you and all the others vowed the same jesus prays in gethsemane they went to the olive grove called gethsemane and jesus said sit here while i go and pray it took peter james and john with him and he became deeply troubled and distressed he told them my soul is crushed with grief to the point of death stay here and keep watch with me he went on a little further and fell to the ground he prayed that if it were possible the awful hour awaiting him might pass him by abba father he cried out everything is possible for you please take this cup of suffering away from me yet i want your will to be done not mine then he returned and found the disciples asleep he said to peter simon are you asleep couldn't you watch with me even one hour keep watching pray so that you will not give in to temptation but the spirit is willing but the body is weak then jesus left them again and prayed the same prayer as before when he returned to them again he found them sleeping so they couldn't keep their eyes open and they didn't know what to say when he returned to them the third time he said go ahead and sleep have your rest but no the time has come the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners up let's be going look my betrayer is here jesus is betrayed and arrested and immediately even as jesus said this judas one of the twelve disciples arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs they'd been sent by the leading priests the teachers of religious law and elders the traitor judas had given them a pre-arranged signal you will know which one to arrest when i greet him with a kiss then you can take him away under guard as soon as they arrived judas walked up to jesus rabbi he exclaimed and gave him the kiss and the others grabbed jesus and arrested him but one of the men with jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's slave slashing off his ear jesus asked them am i some dangerous revolutionary that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me why don't you arrest me in the temple i was there among you teaching every day but these things are happening to fulfill what the scriptures say about me then all his disciples deserted him and ran away one young man following behind was clothed only in a long linen shirt when the mob tried to grab him he slipped out of his shirt and ran away naked jesus before the council they took jesus to the high priest's home where the leading priests the elders and teachers of religious law had gathered meanwhile peter followed him at a distance and went right into the high priest's courtyard there he sat with the guards warming himself by the fire inside the leading priests and the entire council were trying to find evidence against jesus so they could put him to death but they couldn't find any many false witnesses spoke against him but they contradicted each other finally some men stood up and gave this false testimony we heard him say i will destroy this temple made with human hands in three days i will build another made without human hands but even then they didn't get their story straight then the high priest stood up before the others and asked jesus well aren't you going to answer these charges what do you have to say for yourself but jesus was silent and made no reply then the high priest asked him are you the messiah the son of the blessed one jesus said i am and you will see the son of man seated in the place of power at god's right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said why do we need other witnesses you've all heard his testimony what is your verdict guilty they all cried he deserves to die then some of them begin to spit at him and they blindfolded him and beat him with their fists prophesied to us they jeered and the guards slapped him as they took him away peter denies jesus meanwhile peter was in the courtyard below one of the servant girls who worked for the high priest came by and noticed peter warming himself the fire she looked at him closely and said you were one of those with jesus of nazareth but peter denied it i don't know what you're talking about he said and he went out into the entryway just then a rooster crowed when the servant girl saw him standing there she began telling the others this man is definitely one of them but peter denied it again a little later some of the other bystanders confronted peter and said you must be one of them because you're a galilean peter swore a curse on me if i'm lying i don't know this man you're talking about and immediately the rooster crowed the second time suddenly jesus words flash through peter's mind before the rooster crows twice you will deny three times that you even know me and he broke down and wept chapter 15 jesus trial before pilate very early in the morning the leading priests the elders and the teachers of religious law the entire high council met to discuss their next step they bound jesus led him away and took him to pilate the roman governor pilate asked jesus are you the king of the jews jesus replied you have said it then the leading priests kept accusing him of many crimes and pilate asked him are you going to answer them what about all these charges they're bringing against you but jesus said nothing much to pilate's surprise now it was the governor's custom each year during the passover celebration to release one prisoner anyone the people requested one of the prisoners at that time was barabbas a revolutionary who had committed murder in an uprising the crowd went to pilate and asked him to release a prisoner as usual would you like me to release to you this king of the jews pilate asked for he realized by now that the leading priests had arrested jesus out of envy but at this point the leading priest stirred up the crowd to demand the release of barabbas instead of jesus pilate asked them then what should i do with this man you call the king of the jews they shouted back crucify him why pilate demanded what crime is he committed but the mob roared even louder crucify him so to pacify the crowd pilate released barabbas to them he ordered jesus flogged with a lead tipped whip then he turned him over to the roman soldiers to be crucified the soldiers mocked jesus the soldiers took jesus into the courtyard of the governor's headquarters called the praetorium and called out the entire regiment they dressed him in a purple robe and they wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head then they saluted him and taunted hail king of the jews and they struck him on the head with a reed stick spit on him and dropped on their knees to mock worship when they were finally tired of mocking him they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again then they led him away to be crucified the crucifixion a passerby named simon who was from cyrene was coming in from the countryside just then and the soldiers forced him to carry jesus cross simon was the father of alexander and rufus and they brought jesus to a place called golgotha which means place of the skull they offered him wine drugged with myrrh but he refused it then the soldiers nailed him to the cross they divided his clothes and threw dice to decide who would get each piece it was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him a sign announced the charge against him it read the king of the jews two revolutionaries were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left the people passing by shouted abuse shaking their heads in mockery ha look at you now they yelled at him you said you were gonna destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days well then save yourself and come down from the cross the leading priests and teachers of religious law also mocked jesus he saved others they scoffed but he can't save himself let this messiah this king of israel come down from the cross so we can see it and believe him even the men who were crucified with jesus ridiculed him the death of jesus at noon darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock and then at three o'clock jesus called out with a loud voice which means my god my god why have you abandoned me some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet elijah one of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink wait he said let's see whether elijah comes to take him down then jesus uttered another loud cry and breathed his last and the curtain in the sanctuary of the temple was torn into from top to bottom when the roman officer who stood facing him saw how he had died he exclaimed this man truly was the son of god some women were there watching from a distance including mary magdalene mary the mother of james the younger and of joseph and salome they had been followers of jesus and had cared for him while he was in galilee many other women who had come with him to jerusalem were also there the burial of jesus this all happened on friday the day of preparation the day before the sabbath as evening approached joseph of arimathea took a risk and went to pilate and asked for jesus body joseph was an honored member of the high council and he was waiting for the kingdom of god to come pilate couldn't believe that jesus was already dead so he called for the roman officer and asked if he had died yet the officer confirmed that jesus was dead so pilate told joseph he could have the body joseph bought a long sheet of linen cloth then he took jesus body down from the cross wrapped it in the cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock then he rolled a stone in front of the entrance mary magdalene and mary the mother of joseph saw where jesus body was laid chapter 16 the resurrection saturday evening when the sabbath ended mary magdalene mary the mother of james and salome went out and purchased burial spices so they could anoint jesus body very early on sunday morning just at sunrise they went to the tomb on the way they were asking each other who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb but as they arrived they looked up and saw that the stone which was very large had already been rolled aside when they entered the tomb they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side the women were shocked but the angel said don't be alarmed you're looking for jesus of nazareth who was crucified he isn't here he is risen from the dead look this is where they laid his body now go and tell his disciples including peter that jesus is going ahead of you to galilee you will see him there just as he told you before he died the women fled from the tomb trembling and bewildered and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened then they briefly reported all this to peter and his companions afterward jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life amen after jesus rose from the", " dead early on sunday morning the first person who saw him was mary magdalene the woman from whom he had cast out seven demons she went to the disciples who were grieving and weeping and told them what had happened but when she told them that jesus was alive and she had seen him they didn't believe her afterward he appeared in a different form to two of his followers who were walking from jerusalem into the country they rushed back to tell the others but no one believed them still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together he rebuked them for their stubborn unbelief because they refused to believe those who had seen him after he had been raised from the dead and then he told them go into all the world and preach the good news to everyone anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved but anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned these miraculous signs will accompany those who believe they will cast out demons in my name and they will speak in new languages they will be able to handle snakes with safety and if they drink anything poisonous it won't hurt them they will be able to place their hands on the sick and they will be healed when the lord jesus had finished talking with them he was taken up into heaven and sat down in the place of honor at god's right hand and the disciples went everywhere and preached and the lord worked through them confirming what they said by many miraculous signs", "morning everybody just taking a good look we uh yeah everybody's here I just want to uh let you know something that's taking place uh hawana is rejoining us back on staff welcome hawana back to church staff today she's uh coming back on is my admin so uh you could that'll help us all out a lot so I'm thrilled about that today also would you please continue to pray last week I mentioned that we were making a couple of offers on properties here on Monroe Street as a church and we are now officially in negotiations with one of those properties so please continue to pray for God's Direction in that regard we'll tell you more about that if that begins to look more possible I want to say this as well I just want to call this out just today already so far in this service I have in my spirit there's like a disturbance like in a good kind of way in a good kind of way not a bad kind of way in a good way and for some of you today it is clear that there is a hunger or a desperation for God to do a work and if if that's you today if you are if you are like in a unique way calling out reaching out to God lean into that today don't run away from it because there was only one thing when you are hungry for real when you are really hungry God is the only one that can feel that hunger and uh and so let me answer that today Ezekiel chapter 22. hold on I just think everybody smile at me real real quick I just never smile to me guys in about three minutes you might not be smiling at me so uh just just one I just wanted to get that in my head I just want to get that in my head right now okay I you all love me you all love me right now it's a 11 37. everybody still loves Massacre okay Ezekiel 22. says God says this I look for someone who might rebuild the wall of righteousness somebody say righteousness that guards the land I search for someone to stand in the Gap in the wall so I wouldn't have to destroy the land but I found no one I I must have been a pretty rough era okay God found nobody nobody that was righteous and I want you to catch this today God is always looking for a man or woman of God who is righteous he's always looking for a righteous person he's always looking for a young man or a young woman to be set apart he's always searching for a teenager that has decided to choose Faith and Hope and love instead of giving in to the pressures that are all around them he's looking for a person who will intercede on behalf of others to instruct others to set an example and to inspire those that are in danger of the flames he's always looking for someone today we're going to learn about a man that God chose God chose a man named Noah the society that Noah lived in was a society of unbelief it was a wicked and corrupt generation that might sound familiar a wicked and corrupt generation Genesis 6 1 says this then the people began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them the sons of God saw the beautiful women and took any they wanted as their wives in case you're curious sons of God doesn't actually mean humans it's speaking to Fallen Angels then the Lord said my spirit will not put up with humans for such a long time for they are only mortal flesh in the future their normal lifespan will be no more than 120 years in those days and for some time after giant nephilites lived on the earth why giant nephilites Nephilim I mean maybe you have some Nephilim friends but probably not because these are The Offspring of humans and Fallen Angels this is a crazy passage okay for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous Warriors of ancient times the Lord observed the extent of human wickedness on the Earth and he saw that everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil so the Lord was sorry he had ever made them and put them on the earth it broke his heart God called the people on the earth at that time corrupt and full of violence but Noah found favor with the Lord this is the account of Noah and his family Noah was a righteous man somebody said righteous righteous man blameless among the people of his time and he walked Faithfully with God Noah had three sons Shem ham and japheth now the Earth was corrupt in God's sight and full of violence you should always pay attention when the Bible's talking about violence it's one of the big ones it's one of the things that God really really really hates God saw how corrupt the Earth had become for all the people on Earth had corrupted their ways their ways their ways is an interesting thing there what it means is that the people on the Earth had ruined their lives and all the possibilities of the future they corrupted their walk they corrupted their talk they corrupted their habits they corrupted their character everything was a disaster but Noah was righteous in spite of the wickedness that had so fully engulfed the world around him the whole world was in deficit the whole world was corrupted in violence but Noah stood firm man Jesus was once talking with his disciples and so now we're fast forwarding quite a few thousand years but Jesus was once talking with a group of his disciples and his disciples asked him this question what will signal your return like and the end of the world they wanted to know when Jesus was going to come back like Jesus when are you coming back when's the end of the world going to happen because we would really like to know we'd like a little head start a little warning about that if I could be a little prepared and this is what Jesus responded when the son of man meaning Jesus when Jesus returns it will be like it was in Noah's days hmm what were the days of Noah like well we just read it's another way of saying the conditions of the world before the coming of Jesus will be like the conditions of the world before Noah Noah the Ark and the flood and what were those things that we just read we read about sexual corruption demonic activity constant evil in the heart of men widespread corruption and violence that is literally the daily experience of our nation and you if you haven't recently if you haven't recently considered hmm I wonder when Jesus is coming back when I was a kid I thought about that about 25 times a day okay if you haven't recently asked yourself the question I wonder when Jesus is coming back you might want to add that to the list of things you consider on a regular basis and you may want to ask the question as a follow-up am I in a place in my spiritual life right now where it would be okay for me if Jesus came back right now I'll leave the answer to that to you and Jesus because it is exactly right now it sure seems like it's just like the days of Noah right now throughout scripture there are these two themes that that emerge in scripture there's a theme of Zion and a theme of Babylon Zion is like this place the symbol of light and hope and love and righteousness and all things that are good and holy in Babylon however represents corruption and captivity and paganism and hedonism now hold those two thoughts for a long time in American history Christians came to America because they viewed it as a New Zion of sorts but if an alien came to America today like it just kind of floated down theological alien especially theological alien he landed on the earth on a scouting mission and he landed in DC he would find that there is an Empire that is corrupted and far closer to Babylon than it is to Zion not because of whatever the newest trend of political fervor or policy changes are that's not why but because we are a nation like it was in the days of Noah that's why they'd be like I thought this was Zion report backpack this is Babylon send us to the other place because their ways are corrupted their ways are corrupted that's us their ways are corrupted but also their thoughts God also observed the sin that was in men's hearts anyone might see the wickedness of a man was great but God's eyes could see even further verse 5 says he saw that everything they thought everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil not only were they evil in their deeds but every imagination behind everything they thought was evil all the time and that might be why that honestly just might be why Jesus hasn't quite come back yet maybe maybe there's some hope for some of the thoughts and Imagination still maybe there's a little bit of Hope in there I'm going to hold on to that so the Lord was sorry he ever made them and put them on the earth it broke his heart I broke his heart in other words God was saddened to the point of near despair God knew all along that this was a possibility God knew it was possible he knew the future and all the possibilities of the future but a core tenet of God's love for us is God's willingness to take a risk on us love requires risk there is no such thing as love without risk no risk no love no opportunity to choose God then there's no real love but the scripture tells us loud and clear that God has a clear desire for good and not for evil so when evil happens it's outside of what God intends and when Humanity corrupts God's gifts and rejects his love it deeply impacts him God is Not unfeeling in the face of human sin he's not unfeeling in the face of human Rebellion or destruction it deeply impacts him I want you to see in the story that God chose Noah he chose him the Lord said in verse 7 I will wipe this human race I have created from the face of the Earth yes I will destroy every living thing all the people the large animals the small animals that Scurry along the ground and even the birds of the sky I am sorry I ever made them verse 8 but Noah found favor with the Lord now what God had commanded all the Earth to be cleansed of the spiritual pollution he found one man with whom he would begin again here we see the word favor is the same word for Grace Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord no it didn't earn Grace he found Grace because nobody can earn Grace but we can all find it Noah was different and God liked what he saw with Noah and catch this now God is still looking today for somebody to give favor to somebody different somebody willing to stand out from the crowd someone who is obedient even when surrounded by a rebellious generation if you are a young person today listen to this God is looking for a young person who will not be sucked into all the pressure but who will stand as a Beacon of Hope for those that around them that are drowning someone who has faith when surrounded by fear someone who does what God says when society says do whatever your heart says someone who is willing to lay it all down when Society is screaming look out for number one you will look out for everyone else instead what's so special about Noah what's so special about Noah that that God noticed him what did God see in Noah well Noah was a righteous man it says in verse 9 blameless among the people of his time and he walked Faithfully with God Faithfully with God he was righteous this is the first time that the word righteous is used in the Bible in the story Noah's righteousness did not come from his good works but his good works came because he was righteous in other words you can't earn your way to being good good luck with that that's why some of you've been struggling so long trying to earn your way you are righteous and then you do the good things no it was blameless it's if if righteous describes Noah standing before God then blameless describes his conduct before people blameless doesn't mean sinless it means having integrity he was a man of integrity in the world that didn't have any and that sounds just like today if you are a person of Integrity today you will stand out from the crowd because you have integrity in a world that so seldom has any Noah was faithful maybe you've heard maybe you know the rest of the story that we're reading today and maybe you know that Noah built the ark a big boat what you might not know is this that before Noah built an ark he built a Godly character okay that's that's the most important part Genesis 6 13 we'll pick up the rest of the story so God said to know I'm going to put an end to all the people for the Earth that's filled with violence because of them I am surely going to destroy both them and the Earth so make yourself an ark of Cypresswood so Audi goes to the backyard starting to build a big boat I'm going to bring flood waters verse 17. I'm going to bring flood waters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens every creature that has the Breath of Life in it everything on Earth will perish but I will establish my Covenant with you and you will enter the ark you and your sons and your wife and your son's wives with you you are to bring into the ark too of all living creatures male and female to keep them alive with you verse 22 Noah did everything just as God commanded him well hold on a second if you never read this story before or if the only time you ever read the story was in the precious moments Bible you thought this was a good story you thought hey this is a happy story a bunch of animals it's gonna be a big party out there this is a complicated story of God's destruction okay this is a complicated story but God chose this family God is looking for a man and a woman and young people who will do everything he has commanded you see evil causes undeniable pain in our world a flood of pain and families and our relationships it causes Injustice for the Weak and Powerless where children are abused and people are left unprotected and families are attacked that's what happens how is it that in the midst of all of this God that Noah created a Godly character well in verse 22 it clearly says Noah did everything just as God commanded him it's not Magic he just did what God commanded him Noah was obedient he did not waver from his calling the Bible doesn't tell us anything about him questioning it but Noah just went out and obeyed Noah was standing in the gap for mankind everybody should pay attention to this like maybe his wife and kids is like Dad just out building a boat for the weekend but we don't know what boats are so we're not sure what that's all about literally everything else is connected to Noah's obedience had no Ed not built a Godly character and then built that Ark and been obedient we never would have had Abraham if we didn't have Abraham we wouldn't have had Israel and if we wouldn't had Israel we wouldn't have Jesus so it's a good thing Noah went out and built the ark one man's obedience is connected to another man's destiny and think about this in your story in your family Journey you might be Noah out doing something nobody else understands but your obedience will be their destiny your obedience will be their Destiny and they may not ever fully appreciate that or understand that because you may be long gone by then but you are leaving a generational Legacy of Destiny for those that come after Noah also moved in fear and faith Hebrews 11 says it was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood he obeyed God who warned him about things that had never happened before by his faith Noah condemned the rest of the world and he received the righteousness that comes by faith it's an interesting Passage without seeing Noah built this ship in the middle of dry land nothing like this had ever happened before it was kind of crazy but he did it anyhow he had the right kind of fear the fear of God not the fear of people not the fear of caring what other people think or how it might make you or how many Instagram likes you got or Tic Tac views or be real or whatevers I'm not sure yet I keep waiting for be real to go off in church one day and everybody'd be like dude you know so if you don't know what I'm talking about ask a 12 year old okay fear and faith in God keep him moving okay his faith condemned the world it said what does that mean it means that as the worship team comes up it means that Noah's Act of Faith drew a sharp line between the evil of the unbelieving world and the righteousness of the believing world it was a line in the Sands like that side's wrong this side's right this is those that are righteous this is those that are unrighteous because Noah was the line like he made the line Noah's Act of Faith drew that line between right and wrong and hear this clearly today God is still looking today for people that will choose right when all around us is wrong God still chooses men and women who are righteous God still chooses men and women who are obedient God still chooses that one who stands when everybody else sits that one who keeps on praying when everybody else gave up a long time ago that one that holds the line when everybody else has surrendered the line God still chooses regular people who are willing to build an ark in faith long before it starts to rain and friends God I believe desperately is calling us to do exactly that because we are perilously close to living in the days of Noah perilously close would you stand with me as we close today if you missed it God wants to choose you God wants to choose you you are Noah for your generation but listen it's not just one of us here there's a lot of us here so there is still hope there is still hope don't miss that there is still hope God still wants to choose you to live a righteous life a righteous life that can be a rescue for all around us it's like we're building the ark together for an entire planet today there may be some things that are in your life right now that would exempt you from saying that you are righteous hear God calling you today to surrender that to him Just Surrender to him turn away from unrighteousness and hold righteousness if there's a standard that you've been slipping on because it's just complicated out there in a broken and Fallen World pick up the standard draw the line be the line Hold the Line God has something better for you whether it's hey I need to get right with God today or whether it's I need to hold the stand whether it's I am encouraged today because I've been out here fighting and I forgot that this was really important it's really important God chooses men and women and young people still today that are righteous and he wants to shower his favor upon them may that be you may that be me [Music] the worship team is going to lead us as they do everywhere in this room everywhere in this room turn those things over to Jesus give them over to Jesus today in your family in your journey in your struggles the things you're trying to overcome and the things that you are trying to empower just give it over to Jesus today there's an arc for you to build there's an ark for us to build we need to make sure we keep on building keep on building let's be the rescue let's Advance the kingdom of God together and earlier I mentioned this it is clear to me today that some of you are hungry and desperate in a different kind of way foreign God [Music] a move of God the hand of God the Finger of God in your life [Music] Hold the Line Hold the Line run to Jesus today the altars are open let's just spend some time in worship and prayer today", "thank you Pastor Kurt hello everyone happy Mother's Day to you oh thank you just want to take a moment to just acknowledge that Mother's Day is a wonderful time to celebrate moms and mother figures in our lives but it's also a complicated day for many of us in many different ways and we just want to let you know that we see that we see you we care for you and we're praying for you today well I'm grateful to be here preaching the message today for those of you who don't know me my name is Emily I'm married to uh Pastor David that handsome man in the back there we have a one-year-old little girl that brings us a lot of joy I'm an associate pastor here at East Coast International Church and I oversee adult discipleship still learning a lot and today I'm especially grateful for a God that continues to choose to use people who are not perfect or put together and so I'm believing that he's going to use this message to morning to be this morning today to be a blessing to you and I would ask you to pray with me before we jump in can we pray real quick God we thank you for this church we thank you for this time God I pray that you would be here with us we thank you for your presence and we just pray that you would speak to our hearts that you Holy Spirit would help us to hear what we need to hear to be open and receptive and we just ask you to speak in whatever way you want to in Jesus name amen amen lately I've had the privilege to speak with quite a few of you who have been sharing with me about family members that you're praying for that don't know Jesus yet for some it's a spouse for someone's a child a parent all different kinds of family members and I consider it a privilege to talk about this because it takes a lot of hard honesty and bravery to acknowledge that someone that you love doesn't know God just a few weeks ago I sat and I prayed with a few moms who were very seriously praying for their kids and even before we started praying while we were just sitting in a room talking about the prayer requests you could feel the presence of God there very strongly and as we prayed I couldn't help but notice how very close these mothers Hearts were to God's Own Heart today I want to talk to you about God's heart for people and how Disciples of Jesus share God's heart for people today I'm going to ask you to listen with your heart and with your spirit as well as with your mind and your will if you've been coming to bible study on Wednesday nights you've heard me say the main character of the Bible is God the Bible is one big story about God and every story has a big problem or a big conflict right so what is the big problem in God's story well the Bible presents it to us in Genesis that humans God's creation that was most like him got kicked out of his presence and could no longer live forever with him that's God's problem that we can't be close and live forever with him anymore that really bothers him so much so that the whole rest of the Bible is about God this epic hero the ultimate hero on a journey to restore Humanity to its rightful State and position and today as we reflect on this problem that God has we're going to reflect on three invitations in the Bible to share God's heart for people we can be God's prayer Partners we can be God's ambassadors and we can be God's body prayer is paradoxical it's extremely simple and yet completely mysterious at the same time but one thing is for certain prayer is powerful one of the best ways to pray powerful prayers is to be specific in Luke chapter 18 starting in verse 35 we get the story of a beggar who was blind and when he hears that Jesus is around he yells have mercy on me have mercy on me now that's a prayer that's a great prayer we could pray that prayer sometimes and just sit with it and be silent and listen to God respond but notice that Jesus did not hear that prayer and immediately run over and heal him instead he asks for specifics what do you want me to do for you so this situation has now gone from a vague spiritual hope to a very specific ask I want to see how do you know if a prayer that you're praying is specific you know it's specific if you can identify clearly that it was or was not answered this man asked Jesus to heal his blindness at the end of their encounter that either would have happened or not that's totally different than have mercy on me sometimes we get caught up in this God I pray for my family God I pray for wisdom God I pray for World Peace God I pray for strength sometimes I think about God I pray for this food well what are you praying for the food what you wanted to be able to come resurrect come back to life you want it to taste better than it does supernaturally be more delicious somebody I remember used to pray God turn it into muscle not fat I don't think I don't think that prayer got answered it didn't get answered for me but anyway moving on sorry sometimes we get caught in these vague prayers but there's something special about praying specific prayers God would you help my daughter get to know you and get plugged into a church Community God would you heal my marriage God would you rescue my friend from addiction God would you help me connect with my neighbors and help them get to know you when your specific prayers are answered it helps people to acknowledge and glorify God when that blind man was healed the Bible says that immediately he followed Jesus glorifying God and all the people who saw this gave praise to God but praying specific prayers is really scary because people will know and you will know if it doesn't happen the way you prayed there are so many things that we can't control that's why it's so important when we pray that we don't give up if there's someone that you're praying for today I would encourage you don't give up praying for them sometimes the answer to your prayer doesn't come in the timing you want it to there are things you can control in the physical world as well as in the spiritual realm there are variables in play When you pray that you cannot see and you cannot control but there's nothing that you cannot pray about remind yourself about projects and people and miracles happening all over the world that humanly speaking should not have happened naturally speaking things were not lined up to succeed but the prayers of the Saints pushed through the spiritual chaos and opened the way for the forces of King Jesus to be released over that project that person that problem that's what we're believing for and it may take some time Jesus even taught his disciples always pray and never give up persistence is a key ingredient for a prayer Warrior one of the most influential church leaders from history was a North African Roman with a brilliant mind named Augustine Augustine had sought out a lot of different ideas and philosophies and he had come to believe that there was no truth but he had a mother who never stopped praying for him he wrote in a confession to God you drew up my soul out of that profound Darkness because my mother your faithful one wept to you on my behalf more than mothers are accustomed to weep for the bodily deaths of their children Augustine basically gives his mother Monica credit for his salvation he compared the time in which he lived as a sinner to being dead that's how Monica saw it and that's why she prayed for rebirth and God heard her prayers and that man got saved and changed world history I thank God for the people who don't give up on praying for their loved ones that are far from Jesus and be in God's prayer partner is not just for moms it's not just for parents it's not just for adults or the super spiritual this kind of loving Furious desperate powerful Satan stomping prayer is what Jesus did and it's a major way that we can share God's heart for people one of the best ways to be God's prayer partner is to call for backup all through my years growing up my mom had a prayer partner someone that she'd get together with regularly to pray I figure people like this are hard to find so this woman my mom's prayer partner had a few quirks as as all people do I recall that she sometimes seemed quite nervous about what was going on in the world that she often had just a little bit of pink lipstick on her teeth and that she censored the movies that us kids watched with Extreme Caution Extreme Caution 1950s Batman was like danger zone I'm gonna cut out some of those anyway but this woman could pray [Music] her attention span for prayer was well cultivated her sincerity and her Readiness to launch into prayer over any presenting need was convicting she's been praying for me my whole life and I still get messages from her from time to time when I got old enough I was fortunate enough to pray with her a few times and it was really formative for me to watch her pray she's not a perfect person but she speaks so often to the one who is perfect and I believe that if Jesus followers would pray like her the whole world would look drastically different what about you can you think of someone right now that you could champion in prayer do you get tired or hesitant does your faith wither or your attention wane call for backup get together with other Jesus people and pray it's a great way to engage your spirit and God's heart for the world and when you're praying for Humanity especially for those who don't know God yet don't be surprised if you hear God saying whom should I send as a messenger for this people who will go for us because since the beginning of the book God has been sending ambassadors to his loved but estranged Humanity have you ever been a brand ambassador being a brand ambassador is it strikes me as kind of funny makes me think of Texas Roadhouse because when I was in high school my best friend's brother he worked at Texas Roadhouse and he was miserable there he hated that job but they have these cute little outfits that the employees wear that says I heart my job and so me and my friend would go there sometimes on his shift and eat there for a meal and Heckle him the whole time he was a terrible brand ambassador he complained he trash talked his workplace co-workers the handbook everything the food off the clock and a lot of brand ambassadors are like that they're highlighting a product or a company primarily because if they do they'll get paid or it'll enable them to keep some schedule they want or some benefits that they're after but I'm talking about something different when I talk about being an ambassador today I'm talking about Jesus's people who have already been paid by Jesus whose Eternal retirement bonuses and benefits are already secure and serving God and for them serving God has become a connection to their identity Abraham was one of the first of these ambassadors and his legacy and reach to the world is breathtaking in fact all throughout scripture God is very openly declaring that his plan is not for the individual people he's working with per se not for little pockets of people here it's not just for the ones who respond to him first if you're connecting with God it is not long before you are recruited to be part of the team that's working to reclaim the whole planet for its rightful King the Israelites were also called to be ambassadors to the world but you can't have a heart for God's Pete you can't have a heart for people you can't have God's heart for people if your loyalties are divided so in a sweeping Cosmic move God sends himself as an ambassador right before Jesus was born the spirit of God gave a man named Zachariah this beautiful message it says because of the Lord's tender Mercy the Morning Light from Heaven is about to break upon us to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death and to guide us to the path of peace have you ever noticed how spiritually dark the world is everyone's doing their own thing sometimes it seems like no one's even fighting against sin or seeking out truth oftentimes we can be tempted to treat death and tragedy like oh it's just a roommate I tried to kick him out once but I couldn't so we just live with them now you know but God's vision for humans is totally different Jesus said I am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life you see God is trying to get Humanity to Envision a totally different existence he's trying to bring us back to himself to desire the life we were made to enjoy instead of settling for this shadow of death existence and Jesus himself breaks the curse that holds us back shows us what God is like and teaches us how to live out the heart of God for the world around us Jesus is the brand and you and I are the brand ambassadors Jesus is the light of life and we are the light Bringers when Jesus said whoever follows me will have the light of life just to clarify he was not talking about some high Vibe Inner Light that you find in yourself if you meditate enough he was talking about himself he is the light of the world and we have him if that does not impact you today if that doesn't blow you away I would encourage you to invest in getting to know Jesus so you can understand how truly awesome that is the whole world guys the whole world exists in darkness and we have the light of Life Jesus himself and just in case we're inclined to hide out in our little lives and enjoy the light of Life all to ourselves Jesus said to us you are the light of the world so let your light shine before others that they may see your good deeds and glorify the Father in heaven the Bible invites you and I to be God's ambassadors sharing his heart for people just a couple of thoughts about ambassadors before we move on number one ambassadors of God are rooted elsewhere this world is not my home I have a citizenship in the kingdom of heaven and that's a paradigm shifting mindset number two ambassadors are used to being in the spiritual minority without giving up their identity have you ever met an immigrant who has lived somewhere for decades and decades and yet they still retain a very thick accent when I lived in Central America I got to meet a lot of missionaries from the states and for some reason people from the South just really seem to hold on to their accents have you ever heard someone speak Spanish with a Southern accent it's algo realmante and crave lay my friends I'm not sure why that happens with the southern people in particular but what I know about ambassadors of God is that the pressure to hide from or adapt to the spiritual culture around his immense we have to hold on to the spiritual culture of Jesus and we have to be accustomed to being in a spiritual minority number three ambassadors own their role to influence those around them if your trust is in Jesus the Holy Spirit lives in you and you will be different from those who do not trust in Jesus an ambassador of God leans into that difference don't hide your light shine it before I worked at the church I had a co-worker who asked me a question that still haunts me to this day she asked me why do Christians act shy or nervous when I find out that they're Christians or when they talk about their faith and I want to ask you that why do Christians act shy or nervous why do we act shy or nervous at our church we actually do a class about being an influencer for Jesus it's called ignite and once you've been coming for a while and serving for a while you get invited we're actually doing one this week what do you think the class mainly focuses on little little preview here for those of you who haven't attended yet a little review for those of you who have do we talk a lot about leadership skills do we talk a lot about how to make people more interested in your mentorship no we focus on character because ambassadors imitate Jesus and that's what enables them to influence the world for good so where are we so far in this message we've gone over how the Bible invites us to share God's heart for people by being his prayer Partners that's a way to engage your spirit by being his ambassadors that's a way to engage your inner identity and by being his body have you ever seen the movie Ratatouille anybody it's a good movie if you haven't spoiler alert this movie is about a gifted rat who loves cooking and controls a guy by pulling his hairs thus allowing this clumsy but lovable young man to uphold his father's Legacy as the greatest Chef in the world being the body of Jesus is kind of like that we're the clumsy garbage boy turned heir of an Empire but it's not on our own Merit we don't know what we're doing we need the spirit of God that would be Remy the rat in this analogy to help us operate our lives I'm sorry Holy Spirit I'm glad and and you know what it's a win-win because God loves to use us he loves to partner with us this is what Paul was talking about when he wrote and so dear brothers and sisters I plead with you to give your what your bodies to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you let them be a living and holy sacrifice the kind he will find acceptable this is truly the way to worship Him you are a Living Sacrifice God doesn't want you to die for him remember death is part of the problem God wants you to live for him and not just in some spiritual sense but physically with your body your body becomes a vehicle for what God wants to do we see this metaphor in various places in scripture we're told our bodies are meant to honor God because they're his Temple or that each of us make up one small part of Jesus's body here on Earth not everything is spiritual or mystical that's why it matters how you speak how you love how you serve how you relax it matters how you eat it matters how you sleep and how you work because your body isn't just for you followers of Jesus actually belong to Jesus from the inside out and the thing about being God's body that is so challenging is that he refuses to control us and force us to do things so being the body of God remains both a responsibility and an invitation one that I hope you'll say yes to day after day yes God even my body is yours help me to live as your body do you know that your life has access to a unique audience of people that God cares about deeply everyone has a special access a unique audience in their life when we think of how Jesus lived his life a lot of times we picture him teaching and preaching to the crowds right but did you know that Jesus actually spent most of his life in Ministry trying to avoid crowds he wanted to go meet people where they were at you see him integrating into people's lives into their homes their weddings their family dinners their living rooms he tried to keep people from talking about how awesome he was because he didn't want a mob not because he was trying to avoid people but because he wanted to engage with people where they were he wanted to share meals with people to relate to people when we hear the story of the woman with the issue of blood that she was healed in the middle of a big crowd he stopped everything to engage with her how do you think Jesus wants to engage with the unique audience of your life through you your housing arrangement your job your neighbors your friends and friendly acquaintances are all people that God thinks about cares for and wants to reach and you may be the only ambassador of God in some of their lives and even if you're not the only ambassador of God hey sometimes it takes a village don't pass that responsibility off to somebody else what if he wants to give someone something can he use your hands can he use your belongings what if he wants to hug someone will you extend your arms what if he wants to say something to someone or he wants to let someone know that he's listening can he use your mouth can he use your ears can you use your time and your energy and are you paying attention to what he wants finally a reminder that be in God's body is an invitation to serve what does it mean to serve serving is working it's work that you do for someone or something other than yourself and there's a lot of work to do for God so be his body by serving serve in small ways and in big ways serve when everything is at stake and serve when no one is paying attention serve in mundane day-to-day tasks there's a lot of mundane day-to-day tasks that we need to serve in and that matters to God just as well as serving in world changing capacities Jesus served when he was physically on the earth and now we are his body and he is still all about trying to solve that big problem in the Bible that separation between God and Mankind so what can you do to contribute to the work of reconciling mankind to God what can you do I trust that as you ask that question and make yourself available to God that he'll lead you and if you're not sure I believe Pastor Tanisha may have some good ideas so you should talk to her at this time I'm going to invite the worship team to come forward if you're listening today and you don't have that kind of close relationship with God that I'm describing now is the perfect time to begin that relationship I want to let you know that God made you and he gave you a spirit so that you could be like him and be with him and he's been watching you trying to connect with you since you were in your mama's belly and there is not a moment that you've been through when his heart has not been for you and I don't know if you can identify someone in your life that's been praying for you your whole life but I want you to know that in this room you have spiritual family people who have been praying for you some of us have been praying for decades we may not have known your name to pray for you by name but God knows your name he knows everything about you he loves you and he wants to have a relationship with you if you're interested in responding to that kind of love we're going to sing a song in just a moment and we're going to have time to pray up here I'd invite you to come forward and when someone prays for you let them know I want to have a relationship with God with God close relationship with God [Music] I'm going to invite you to stand to your feet everyone in the room [Music] for those of you who are here today who know God's heart for people and share God's heart for people would you pray for someone that's far from Jesus right now would you pray a specific prayer for them to encounter the irresistible love of Jesus and to be transformed from the inside out and take a moment as you pray to listen listen to God's heart maybe he's saying who will go for me to that co-worker of yours and you need to hear him say that maybe he wants to tell you about some of the work he wants to do and you need to hear him reminding you that you have so much to offer if you're willing to be his body and if you're in here today and you know about the heart of God but somewhere along the way you've gotten overextended and tired and stretched and it seems like a lot to ask I just want to invite you to let God impress his heart on you today to stir a fire in you a passion in you for the things that really matter to him so that the worries and the cares of life will not squeeze out the purposes of God but the opposite the purposes of God will begin to transform your life and I want to pray for freedom that we would have freedom to be all that God is calling us to be that we would have space to be all that God is calling us to be so we're going to take a moment as the worship team leads us in a song please pray and please listen and if you want to you can come up", "foreign good morning good afternoon East Coast International Church uh listen if you did not get a chance to silence your cell phone now is a great time to do that I also want to wish you a happy firework weekend everybody the rest of the country May celebrate Independence Day on July 4th but most of us here in Lynn have already been celebrating for a long time maybe you haven't but your neighbors sure have right now tomorrow we want to invite you to join us at seven o'clock we're going to gather at the flagpoles at Red Rock Park for our City's fireworks celebration you can bring your own chairs towel snacks to share it really is a great time of connection for us as a church the weather apparently there might be thunderstorms apparently maybe a little hail who knows nature might have her own firework display but uh if there are any changes we're gonna keep an eye out on what the city of Lynn says for tomorrow and we'll let you guys know via text message so just keep an eye out for that all right now uh Pastor Emily and Pastor David shared a little bit about Genesis but as we jump in uh one thing that is clear to me is that Genesis is weird as we continue this journey through the book I just want to be honest with you that Pastor Kirk he did US dirty he said you know what I'm gonna be out of the country you guys talk about Genesis um and the reason I say that is because if you haven't read it before there is a lot that is weird and just straight up uncomfortable things that I really hope that as we continue with the series I do not have to say out loud from the stage right but it is really helpful for us to acknowledge as we jump into this that a part of the weirdness is that some of what you read comes from cultural Customs from another part of the world at another period of time in human history and whether people come from this side of the planet or the other whether they're around today or centuries ago people are weird and do weird things right so if as you begin your reading it is weird to you it's weird to me too so that's okay it is also helpful to know that much of the Old Testament is descriptive not prescriptive this means just like Pastor Emily had shared is that it is describing what happens and isn't necessarily a manual of what should happen for example King David he had many wives I think there were eight this may be helpful for you to know but not helpful for you to do now the Book of Genesis is not Moral Stories or Aesop's Fables if you know what those are but rather a history of God's plans for his people and a road map to Jesus last week Pastor David killed it so he did so good I was here for two Services I said let's go for a third uh he brought a really encouraging and challenging message as he shared with us about Abram and how God gave him a promise I'm gonna pick up where he left off and talk to you about waiting for the promise you see God had promised Abram that he would not be just a father but that he would be the father that his offspring would be many and yet Abram found himself childless and he and his wife were elderly Genesis chapter 15 verse 5 the promise is written that says this count the Stars that's how many descendants you will have now how in the world would Abram be a great nation which was to be born from someone's Offspring and Legacy when he had none and presumably would not and could not at face value God made a promise with Abram alone however it takes two to tango and his wife Sarai who was also elderly would somehow be involved right you would think so so uh except Sarai knows her biological clock wasn't just not ticking anymore but it would have been how do we put this nicely expired extinct do you went done so as Abram and Sarai await their promise the voice of God doesn't seem quite so loud how many of you know that the voice of others can sometimes seem so right when waiting on God seems so wrong Genesis 16 verse 2 says so Sarai said to Abram she has some advice for him the Lord has prevented me from having children go and sleep with my servants perhaps I can have children through her and Abram agreed with sarai's proposal the ESV translation says Abram listened to the voice of Sarai listen it'd be your own people sometimes the people who love you they may try to help you but actually in the end turn out to be really unhelpful does that ever happened to anybody here friends we need to be careful whose voices we allow to influence us as we wait on God she said why was his wife his beloved she probably meant well so I probably had his best interest in mind probably really wanted to make him feel good but none of that made what she said right and sometimes you know it's not the voice of others but the voice of culture that influences us as we wait on God at this time in history because Hagar was a slave she was viewed as property not as a person what culture said to do in these circumstances was exactly what Sarai suggested for the slave owner to use slaves for Reproductive purposes but culture is still trying to tell us what to do as we wait on God today but that doesn't make it right I know it oftentimes as we wait on provision culture will tell us go play the lottery get a scratch ticket go to Encore lie a little here cheat a little there you could tie them when you're rich no problem debt is King right wrong and oftentimes as we wait for peace culture will tell us you know what go to the nearest dispensary it's legal now or listen I became a mom last year and the craziest thing to me is this mommy wine thing is very real I have not been to a single gathering with mothers where this is not a major part of what they do just because everyone else says it doesn't make a right or you know culture will also tell you hard stuff you gotta wait just go scroll Doom scroll to your phone falls off let gaming be your piece or Netflix or Tick Tock or this or that there's always something new right but just because culture tells us doesn't mean it's right and the thing that's important for us to know friends is that our impatience has an impact there can be a physical impact Financial mental social spiritual even generational impact for our impatients I'll tell you uh when I got braces uh maybe 10 years ago I can't do the math but but those of you guys who don't know me now you may not know my teeth were jacked up but these babies cost five thousand dollars they're beautiful beautiful Feldman Orthodontics but listen when I have my braces towards the end of your time I had a payment plan towards the end of the time every time I would go the receptionist would ask me are you ready to make your final payment are you ready to make their final payment and I had many final payments left but I was so scared that they were going to keep the braces on me they would never take them off I'm going to be stuck with all these stuff in my mouth it's gonna be crazy and so one day finally I go there and she said you're gonna are you ready to make your final payment and I had my credit card for emergency purposes and I said charge it that bad boy took me eight years to pay off eight years because instead of being patient right instead of waiting and doing it Time After Time After Time I just jumped my impatience had a financial impact it happens also you think of Baruch assault in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory who says Daddy I want a Golden Goose or for those of you guys who are a little bit younger I want a squirrel and I want it now she wants it so bad that she ends up in the abyss of a Willy Wonka's chocolate factory never to be seen again right or you know last week I went swimming I got water in my ear it was really bugging me and I knew I know it's gonna clear on its own because that's what water does and if I would just wait it probably would have cleared up really quickly right well I woke up at three in the morning my ear was bugging me all I could hear was the water and listen I went to CVS three in the morning I spent so much money buying all these things to put in my ear just to get that water out and if I had just waited I probably would not have spent Saturday death for the whole day because I just kept plugging it with more and more stuff and it's the things that we turn to in our impatience that become the things that keep us from receiving the promise in the first place how many of you know when we're distracted we can miss what's right in front of us this happens to a lot of people when you drive you know or I used to take the MBTA and all the time take the bus and the city and I would get distracted I miss my I miss my uh stop you know how long how many extra years of my life I felt like I found the MBTA just because I wasn't paying attention now unfortunately for Abram Sarai and Hagar their impatience had a far-reaching generationally negative impact that some people believe we're still dealing with to this day in Genesis chapter 16 Verses 4 through 6 it says so Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant but when Hagar knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt then psori said to Abram this is all your fault I put my servant in your arms but now that she's pregnant she treats me with contempt the Lord will show who's wrong you or me Abram replied look she's your servant so deal with her as you see fit how passive right then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away this is a good reminder that this is descriptive not prescriptive right see the unfortunate thing is that their impatience it impacted more than just them these people are crazy right the more I read this the more I'm like oh my gosh poor Hagar these people I am so glad I don't live then right and as much as you can say these people are crazy the question that I really want to ask is where is God in all of this see where is God God sought Hagar in the midst of this horrible situation God is searching for Hagar it says the angel of the Lord found Hagar beside a spring of water in the wilderness along the road to sure I'm not great with maps but every map I studied said that this is well over 50 miles away now just to remind you she was a slave and she was pregnant which means that she probably didn't have any belongings of her own any way to get there she didn't leave with permission she just got herself she was out of there 50 miles is really far for someone who's not pregnant to walk can you imagine 50 miles pregnant in the wilderness uh so from girl she's pregnant she got over 50 miles away in the wilderness and even in the wilderness God finds her there at a random spring this God sought her see it's because uh what we don't see at first glance when we read this is that Hagar is Egyptian and this is the god of Israel who normally throughout Genesis you will see that God's chosen people were the Israelites and this is the first glance a first glimpse of Jesus because was it not Jesus who spent his entire life going out of his way to people that nobody would pay attention to everyone over it off and he would go to them to say you are my child right and so this is actually the very first time that an angel of the Lord appears in the Book of Genesis and it's not to one of God's chosen people actually according to the Israelite customs of the time as the slave who ran away she would also be considered a sinner doing something illegal and yet God sought her this was because to God she wasn't a slave but she was his daughter and one of my favorite things about this is that as this is one of God's the first glimpses that God's love and care extends beyond the Israelites because even today God is still seeking people in your pain and challenges God is seeking you out now not only is Hagar saw after by God but Hagar is seen by God saw Hagar you know I picked up my kids in a random Market Basket of like a month or so ago before church on a Wednesday night and I was thinking they'll stay in the car I'm gonna run in grab some dinner and run back out right we'll be at Bible study in no time so I go inside get my grocery store Sushi check out make my way back to the car when I see this sign held up by some seven-year-old hands if you can't read seven-year-old ease this says please help us milamika these two little girls almost had Homeland Security on the scene and I was like man I'm about to be page one of the item I'm gonna be the one I'm talking about on the really you know you from Lynn it's gonna be crazy right and see I was like I'm gonna go do this gentle parenting let's go okay um why would you do this I asked them and you know what they said we wanted to see if anyone would see it I don't know what they would have done if anyone did but thank God if somebody saw that they didn't do anything about it because they were fine right but how many times in life when we're going through something we're just like would anyone see it does anyone see me but God sees Hagar and God sees you and 16 verse 8 through 11 the angel said to her Hagar sarai's servants I just want to pause here not only does the angel know exactly who he's talking to he knows exactly who she is what she does in life he knows that this is agar survives servant God knows us right but then he asked where have you come from where are you going it's like the Cotton Eye Joe over here she says I'm running away from my mistress sirai the angel of the Lord said to her return to your mistress and submit to her Authority then he added I will give you more descendants and you can count the angel also said you are now pregnant and will give birth to a son you are to name him Ishmael which means God hears for the Lord has heard your cry of distress verse 13 thereafter Hagar used another name to refer to the Lord who had spoken to her she said you are the God who sees me you are the God who sees me she also said have I truly seen the one who sees me do you know this is the first time someone in the Bible gives a name to God and it's not one that you would expect God saw Hagar in her situation and her distress and he sees you and I as well he is the god who sees so what does Hagar do Hagar surrenders to God's plan surrender I hate that word terrible word anyone else like me you're allergic to surrender anyone else like I'll take a Zyrtec for that right um see I'll tell you when I had to get my wisdom teeth out the anesthesiologist okay but wisdom teeth out separate time I had to get other teeth for my braces and both times these people were so funny because like all right count back from ten so I count back from ten I said give me more I would not go down Pastor Emily came with me one time and I was holding her hand and the guy was like all right you can leave now and she was like I don't think she can't I don't think I can and I held that hand until I couldn't any longer but I hate surrender but what's Wild to me is that none of what's going on with Hagar is actually her fault and when God finds her he doesn't like sit with her and hug her say here's some money go on your way like that's what that's what I would do if I were with Hagar I'd be like it's okay girl go run run like the wind Bullseye you're right those people are crazy don't go back Sis keep going keep going let's go right but that's not what God does see God sought Hagar God saw Hagar and he challenges her in in structure on what to do next right he says return to your mistress submit to her Authority and I'm sure this wasn't easy to do not only is she running away from the assaults and all the difficulty of the abuse of that situation she's pregnant she's gone over 50 miles she's in the wilderness and yet God says go back that's crazy I'm gonna invite the worshiping to come on up see she had been assaulted by Abram forced to carry his child treated terribly and finally finally she gets away except God says go back what's crazy to me is that she did because she knew she wasn't alone in her situation and neither are you no matter the situation we are seen by God we are seen by God and if you trust him he will carry you through it running away is very rarely the right thing to do hear me I'm not saying if you're being abused that you should sit back and take it absolutely not but many of us find ourselves in difficult situations and rather than wait on God to strengthen us and resolve the situation we'd rather run away leave avoid the situation but if we trust that God sees us and be willing to surrender to his plans we'd see his blessings as well I'm gonna invite you to stand up on your feet today see there are times in our journey with Jesus that we may be going through it as we wait on God and God wants us to be patient because he is working on our behalf if we have faith and we trust in him and surrender to his plans we will get to see the blessing on the other side James 1 12 says God blesses those who patiently endure testing and Temptation afterwards can I say afterwards afterward They will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him this verse that punches me in the spirit James 1 2 through 4 says dear brothers and sisters when Troubles of any kind come your way consider it an opportunity for great joy for you know that when your faith is tested your endurance has a chance to grow so let it grow for when your endurance is fully developed you'll be perfect and complete meaning nothing I know that my walk with God there are times where it'd be so much easier to not have to obey God in the waiting or surrender to his plans first Samuel 15 22 is something that God spoke to me at a very specific time in my life you see when I was 16 I found myself homeless jumping from couch to couch dealing with my own life trying to figure out my plans in this really unfortunate situation and I was lucky enough that my academic Pursuits that I got a scholarship full ride scholarship to go to a college here in Boston you say woohoo let me tell you and I Found Jesus and he told me to go to Bible College which was a private school that would not give me full tuition and I had no way to figure this out I was praying about it and I found this verse that says what is more pleasing to the Lord your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice listen obediences see I was in the situation where I had to choose what am I going to do am I going to choose the easy way that way that looks like a blessing or will I obey and because I obeyed it was hard I worked my tail off in college I had 10 jobs at one point just trying to figure it all out but the day I got to give them that final payment was a day that I saw our God provides right if we would walk out in obedience if we would surrender we would be able to see the blessing on the other side so my friends as we get to see in this last song If you need God's strength to help you to wait well or to help you walk in obedience I want to invite you to come to pray at the altar to give it to God and to receive the grace that you need today so we're going to sing this", "good morning everyone uh for those that I didn't get a chance to meet yesterday I'm Reverend Dr Shannon Polk um I bring you greetings from Ann Arbor Michigan where I currently live for those of you may some of you who like college football you may know that place they're associated with this weird looking Block M uh which they think represents the entire State I had the Good Fortune to make a different educational choice I went to Michigan State University some of you all may be following what's happening with our current coach or not current apparently as the case may be um and I am here with my husband John um we were not necessarily uh prepared for the New England cold um so we have done a whole shift in swapping uh jackets and hoodies and so forth it is actually warmer in Michigan right now than it is here which is really unusual um upstairs is my daughter Lara she's 10 and if you get a chance to meet her you'll know her because she's in constant motion she's a lot of questions and she will talk to you about some really fun facts one of those being that did you know that a wombat poop Square poop and uses its butt as a weapon so that's how you will recognize her because that's what she's going to be talking about now um just to give you a little bit more about me um I my husband and I were both um attorneys um but he's a smart one and um I went to Seminary at his requests because he said you know um you Pentecostals you guys like to do a lot of stuff without finding out exactly why and I was like he's like you need to go to Seminary I said okay honey I'll do that um so I had an opportunity to go to Seminary finish there and I serve at my church as the associate pastor it is a church that is in downtown Flint Michigan you may have heard about Flint we had a little water situation a few years back um and it is over 90 years old right in the Heart of the City now I'm sharing this with you because I grew up in Flint and I think it's important to know where people are from so anyway you understand how they approach scripture and so growing up in Flint my entire life I was there to see the downturn in the automotive industry I was there to see the Water Crisis it is uh where I went to my prom it is where I worked up until recently moving to Ann Arbor and so coming from a manufacturing Community coming from a very blue-collar unionized Place really kind of speaks to how I interpret and approach scripture um my mother raised me on about 18 000 a year um I am what I like to call a regular black that means I eat chitlins uh that means that I know how to do all the slides because that's required and I made my husband learn them um and that too is important for you to understand how I approach scripture because we don't approach scripture neutrally we bring our own perspectives to scripture we bring our experiences both good and bad when we interpret the Bible and so whenever you're listening to someone always keep in mind what experiences they may have that color how they approach scripture so we're going to take a little time this morning and I mean a little bit of time I'm known that my church as the fastest preacher because we were told in seminary that people can't listen that long anymore so you need to be quick with what you have to say so we're going to spend a little bit of time this morning talking about before and after before and after you see there's always a before there's always the night before so for example the night before the Super Bowl right athletes they're nervous they're wondering what's going to happen the night before your world championship run you're thinking about what's going to be the night before graduation you're wondering what's going to happen the night before a major procedure now you're pretty sure what the outcome is going to be but there's always a before now I don't know about you but I experienced a lot of before in my life the night before I gave birth to my daughter what is she going to look like how is she going to be is she going to be nice is it I didn't know if it was a girl or boy I want to be surprised there's always a before the night before I got married are we actually doing this tomorrow is he really going to show up am I just gonna be there by myself all the questions that run through your mind the night before you start a new job did I make the right decision by shifting is it really going to be what I want they said they were going to pay me this but are they really am I going to like the people that I work with there's always a before so the issue is that when you had that before sometimes you can get unsettled sometimes you're not really quite sure what happened so I was here Friday night and my daughter went to sleep upstairs uh right right next to the Loft and it was really kind of funny because as my daughter was asleep she woke up and she was as she woke up she had that little bit of drool right here you know because she was in a deep deep sleep and she woke up she had no idea where she was because she was in an unfamiliar place and I cracked up because my husband grabs her he's like hey just stand and now move this way and walk with me I say that because sometimes we wake up in a place and we're not quite sure how we got there and we're not quite sure what we're supposed to do next and we're looking for some guidance on what needs to happen and that's where God comes in so if you uh have some type of device that allows you to see scripture um if you have an actual paper Bible or I think that um they may put the scriptures on the screen if you could turn to Jeremiah 29 and we're going to start at verse 4. and the context of this is the Israelites had lived in Jerusalem and they knew about Jerusalem but they had just been exiled into Babylon now just to give you some context in Jerusalem they knew all the rules in Jerusalem they were celebrated in Jerusalem they had a long history there in Jerusalem it was home it was familiar in Jerusalem they were in the majority now all of a sudden they find themselves in Babylon in Babylon they were hated in Babylon they're despised in Babylon they don't have any connection anything everything is unfamiliar and in Babylon they were isolated and they were lonely another word for exile it means to be moved against your will another way to translate the word exile is deported and so we see here this is what the lord of Heaven's armies the god of Israel says to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem they were exiled because the king wanted to destroy the power of the Jewish state and so he created isolation for them in a foreign country he told them they were going to have to go to a place where they didn't speak the language and they didn't know the culture it is hard when you are someplace that you do not understand it is hard when you were someplace where everything is different than what you remember that's what's happening in the church right now people want to long back to a time I always call it they always want to go back to Mayberry they want to go back to what's familiar they want to go back to what they knew they want to go back to what makes sense The Winans a long time ago did a song called let's go back to the days of yay and nay everybody wants to go back let me help you out you are where you are because God wants you where you are you're where you are purposefully so if you're going to figure out what to do in this before and after really what you're going to do during that end time there are a couple things you have to do the first thing you have to do is you have to get your bearings much like my time my child waking up with a Drool on the side of her face and she's like oh my gosh what what this is not my bed what's going on that's what the Israelites had to do they had to first get their bearings so if you go to the next verse the Lord told them I'm sorry previous verse I do this a lot at home thanks um the first thing you have to know is you have to establish some anchor points you have to look for markers and we see here the first marker is this is what the lord of Heaven's armies the Lord Almighty the god of Israel says so the first thing you have to know is if you're going to get your bearings in a situation where you are uncomfortable you have been isolated you have been deported you're not sure what's going on the first thing you have to do is remember the character of God you have to remember who he is in that moment because he says right here this is what the lord of Heaven's armies the Lord Almighty the strong God The God Who can do anything but fail and when you're in a difficult situation the first thing you have to remember is who is God to you who is it that he shows up as because otherwise you'll be in that situation and you will be isolated and you will be frustrated the other thing is he says the god of Israel so he's not someone else's God he's your God he's not a God who answers someone else's prayer he's a God who answers your prayer a God who makes himself real to you in your situation the other thing they need to know was that to all the captives that he has exiled see sometimes we find ourselves in that place and we're not quite sure we got there and the reason that we're there is because God has put us there where you are is not on accident God has put you exactly where you are for his purpose and his plan you see there's a comfort that I have when I know that God has placed me somewhere because that means I'm in his hand and he's not going to drop me he's not going to let me fall he's not going to let me get buried he's not going to let me get overwhelmed because he's right there in the midst of the situation with me and when you know that God is the reason why you are where you are you can trust that he is Sovereign and he will take care of you you can trust that he's going to be responsible for making sure you get to your destination safely the next thing you have to do is you have to determine your next steps what is your path so you can go to the next verse now he said build homes and plan to stay plant Gardens and eat the food they produce next slide he says Mary and have children then find spouses for them so you may have many grandchildren multiply do not dwindle away you see he told them to build houses because they had been a nomadic people they could have stayed intense but he didn't want them intense he wanted them to build a permanent dwelling he wanted them to really settle and have roots he wanted them to take land he wanted them to own property why is it so important because when you are in a place of Exile it's important that you don't just say well we're only going to be here a little bit of time so I can just pack light I'm from Flint as I mentioned earlier and it was easy for me to observe people that had come into the community as what we refer to as carpetbaggers because they wouldn't necessarily buy a house they wouldn't necessarily settle down they kind of kept one foot in another place waiting for the time that they could go back and they could leave my community they didn't want to be associated with the community that at one point had the highest murder rate in the nation they didn't want to be associated with the community they had a water problem they didn't want to be associated with the community where there was significant violence and so they were always looking for a way out when God has called you to a place it's not about a way out it's about a way in it's about digging deeper it's about being rooted and planted he also told them to plant Gardens get your food here why because they needed to learn how to grow food in that soil they had learned how to survive in their other place they needed to learn how to survive where they were right now he also told them to marry and reproduce why because there can become a mindset that says you know what I'm not going to be here long I'm not going to establish roots and then what happens their numbers would have begun to dwindle there is power that happens when you reproduce there is power when you establish a large s and I know this because my father was one of 12 kids he was number three and I have over 40 first cousins so when I'm in Flint and they're like hey uh who are you I said I'm a tall bird they're like oh oh okay we know them there's so many of you all and I joke with one of my friends and I said um you know I'm related to one half of the city and you're related to the other and it makes it easy when you're in that place when you're in that night before place it's important not to dwindle it's important to establish roots you see what they were doing unbeknownst to them is they were creating the foundation of a new Society they were preparing for the next steps of people who would really appreciate their freedom and would appreciate their new Prosperity when it came and who would have a memory of gratitude you see sometimes when we stay in a place too long we forget our Before Time so what do I mean by this sometimes if you're I'll use example being a parent sometimes if you're a parent you can forget when your kids are getting on your nerves how much you longed and prayed to become a parent sometimes if you've been married for a long time and your spouse is getting your nerves you forget what it was like when you said oh God just send me someone sometimes when the boss on your job is really aggravating you you for can forget what it meant when you were praying for employment when you're in school and you don't like the deadlines and you feel like the professors are giving you too much homework you can forget you praying to even be able to have the opportunity to go to college and so in that place in Exile God Was preparing not only their hearts but their minds for what he wanted to do when he took them out of Exile now I'm exceptionally Pentecostal what does that mean that means I believe in loud music loud praise and dancing and shouting that's just in my bloodline my grandfather was a Pentecostal pastor now one of the things that the Church of God in Christ which my which is the denomination my grandfather's password is known for what used to be called tarrying Services where they would Linger on the Altar and they would pray why am I sharing that with you now because they would start by remembering all that they had been through and they never wanted to forget all that God had done the last song that we sang today talked about praise praise when is the last time that you spent some time remembering all that God had done for you when is the last time that you thought about really thought about how God has blessed you how he has changed your life all the things that he has brought you from there used to be a song we would sing when I think of the goodness of Jesus and what he's done for me when I think about Jesus and how he set me free I could anybody know the song anybody I could dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance all night when I was a little kid I went to a sleepover I was probably about 10 they serve pizza and they played music I have a friend to this day whose mom also asked what happened to one little girl that ate a whole pizza by herself and dance until one o'clock because that was me and on the occasions that my friends could talk me going someplace to dance they'd have to try to drag me out because I've always been a very exuberant fun-loving person but let me tell you something when I think about my testimony when I think about the ways that God has moved in my life when I think about the multiple Miracles physical Financial emotional breakthroughs that God has done for me I can't do anything but bless him I can't do anything but praise him I can't do anything but lift my hands and sometimes God will allow you to be in a place of Exile because you need to remember because you got a little comfortable you got a little regular and you used to praise with exuberance and now your hand is here you used to praise him everywhere you went and now you're a little quiet we don't need a quiet praise because there's somebody that needs to know what he did for you there's somebody that needs to know your testimony and your story and see when they've married and had kids they were doing what my grandmother did when my grandma said let me tell you about the time that God did this for me let me remind you of how God moved in your life before you were even a thought because you wouldn't be there if God had not put his hand on my life the next thing that they had to do and we'll go to the next verse the Lord reminds them work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile pray for pray to the Lord for it for its welfare will determine your welfare when you seek the peace of the city with that word peace is translated shalom and it means peace prosperity completeness security you see when you grow up in a city like Flint security means a lot I was getting gas one day got out of my car as I got ready to get out of my car somebody else sat down in a passenger side somebody I didn't know let me be clear and I looked and I was like oh it's going to be that kind of day today okay security means a lot when you live in certain communities peace means a lot I grew up in a community where you heard sirens all the time where you might hear gunshots at any given time Prosperity means something different I've moved to another neighborhood now and I realized why I was having trouble walking in my known neighborhood I said oh they don't have sidewalks they got too much grass out here I don't know what to do I'm not comfortable here because I grew up in the city you have to pray for your community you have to seek the peace of that Community because it's too easy to say Lord bless me so I can leave it and not remember what God wants to do is he wants you to pray for your community he also wants to pray for those people that are unjust and in authority we are here for the Justice Conference there can't be Justice until God has just rulers or those rulers who are going to shift I shared yesterday the story of Flint Michigan and how we begin to protest about the Water Crisis until we got new leadership that said this is wrong and we're going to fix it so we pray we pray for those who can help do gun buyback programs we pray for those that can change what's happening in our schools we pray for those that can help bring new jobs to the community and we pray because our welfare is tied to the welfare of the city it's very easy to say I don't want to pray for those folks because they don't worship like I worship they don't believe what I believe they don't live like I live but guess what if their house is on fire and it's next to your house you in trouble and you can't Divorce Yourself on what's going on in their world you can't separate yourself from that person and God didn't cause you to know him in his light and his Truth for you to then be I only want to be with other people that carry the same light your responsibility to go to those who don't have any light and say come follow me and come meet a man come meet a man we have linked faiths and if you don't believe me it goes back to something so simple in the Book of Genesis where God looks the Cain and says where's your brother and he says am I My Brother's Keeper to this day we continue to ask the question am I My Brother's Keeper and the answer that question is always yes always yes and that's why you pray for the peace of the city that's why you pray for the prosperity of the city because he didn't send you here by accident I wasn't born and Flint by accident you're not in Lin by accident it is on purpose because God has a purpose for this community but he needs the people that are going to seek the peace and prosperity of this community just because you pray for your community doesn't mean that you condone every single thing that's happening you can pray and not condone that's where we kind of have a little bit of trouble if I pray for the welfare of those people does that mean I'm approving their behavior approving their choices no but you're saying God I want you to bless everyone in this community because if they're blessed those blessings will touch you as well the other reason is because you're praying for them because they're broken uh one of my favorite scriptures is the one where Paul says and such were some of you sometimes we forget where we were we have to be reminded we're praying for those who are broken in the same way that we were broken we're praying for those that were hurting the same way we were hurting you see in my community growing up it was called catching strays we were taught that bullets don't have a name on them I'm praying for people that I don't know because their behavior may impact my life because they're broken and when they get into a shootout it doesn't matter that I worship here doesn't matter that I haven't been living that way what matters I need to pray for the Peace of everyone in my community the other reason why we're praying and seeking the Peace of the city is because it puts me in right relationship with my neighbor because see when I don't look at you as a them and look at you as an us then I can't despise you I can't hate you I can't distant myself from you when I pray for them I'm doing what Jesus instructed when he said Lord I forgive those who trespass against me please forgive me also because I know I've trespassed against you none of us are perfect and so we need the grace and mercy of God it is important that we learn to be a peace Giver and a peace Seeker the other thing that seeking peace does is that seek is a verb it requires action that prayer requires relationship and connection it requires proximity and it requires presence we can move on to the next slide now this is what God said he says but don't let your prophets and your fortune tellers who are with you in the land of Babylon trick you don't listen to their dreams next slide because they're telling you lies in my name and I haven't sent them there were people that were telling the Israelites that it's okay you don't have to root here you're not going to be here long this is going to be easy it'll be over in a day you all may remember what this sounds like these were the people during covet that oh this is only going to last a couple weeks it's not gonna be that long it's gonna be fine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and as they say it used to say I'm Maury Povich and we determined that was a lie um so when God calls us into that place of captivity you're gonna be there a minute don't listen to the people saying that oh it's going to be over it's going to be quick and you don't have to worry about it no you're gonna be here for a minute you might have to get comfortable okay because see I can live next to somebody I don't like it I'm only there temporarily that's how I could deal with my college roommate I was like oh we only got a couple months I can make this work it's different when you're my neighbor I own this property and I'm next to you we gonna be here a long time our kids are going to grow up next to each other I'm gonna be at the same ball game with you we're going to have relationship I'm gonna see you in the grocery store I'm gonna see you at the drugstore remember your time in this work is not a phase it's not forever but it is indeed a season almost kind of like the stages of life you know when a child is really small and they're a baby and they're so cute and they don't move and all of a sudden they learn how to walk and you're like oh what happened to the one stage I really like that stage or when your child becomes a teenager and they got a little mouth on them and you're like oh remember it's just a stage that captivity you're in it is not forever but it is indeed a season which means you have to have a faith that endures you can't have a faith that is temporary you can't have a faith that says God if you don't bless me in 48 hours I'm gonna try something else you have to have a faith that is a long-haul faith now this is very important for this reason you can go on to the next slide this is what the Lord says you will be in Babylon for 70 years but then I will come and do for you all the good things I have promised and I will bring you home again next slide for I know the plans I have for you says the Lord they are plans for good and not for disaster to give you a future and a hope you see when you're in that Exile the enemy has one job and his job is to make you think that your station has determined your destination or that you're here because God has some particular feeling about you but you see we are Christians we don't believe in karma you're not in this place because God hates you or because God hates your community God doesn't despise people that are in difficult situations you see growing up in Flynn I could always tell when people are like oh you live there was a way they would talk to me and the way they would talk about me assumptions that they made and sometimes I wonder I was like God do you love my city if you love my city why is this happening why is that happening you have to remember that God cares for you even in captivity even in places of Injustice God cares and he cares because he has a plan for us he has a plan for the community and the community is not an accident and it is not an afterthought as a matter of fact you're right in the center of God's Focus and so God tells us what he wants to do he said he wants us to call on him he wants us to pray he wants us to seek him and he wants us to find him you see even when we're lost even we're not sure how we got somewhere God has never lost he always wants to be found by us and he will use even the most challenging of situations for his glory so you have to make sure that you don't lose your heart posture just because it's a difficult season or a difficult place all the enemy wants to do is remove your focus from having a right relationship with God he just wants you to avoid God it's his desire to destroy your hope in your faith in your relationship with the father keep in mind that when we call upon God when we seek God he will listen and he will be found he says a few scriptures now that he will gather Israel again and bring them back to Jerusalem God's desire is always to gather his desire is always to comfort which is why it's so important to always trust in the character of God that he is who he said he would be I have the Good Fortune of having passed into a decade called 50. and I've had a chance to see life from a lot of different phases at this point I had a chance to see what it was like to grow up in a single parent home I had a chance to know what it was like to grow up in an impoverished community I had a chance to know what it's like to address to be addressed through the lens of racism and sexism and when I was younger even ageism I know what it's like to bury both of my parents I know what it's like to be completely broke and yet I stand before you right here I also know what it's like to see God redeem I also know what it's like to see God heal and I also know what it's like to see God restore and I feel like David I was young and now I'm old but I have never seen the righteous forsaken and I've never seen his seed begging bread I want you to know that God always keeps his promises Amen Let Us stand thank you worship team I was just going to say oh I need to call the worship team back up I don't know where you find yourself this morning but what I would say to you is if you find yourself in a place where you feel like you have been exile and you're in a place of captivity know that God cares deeply for you you are not an accident and you are not an afterthought he sees you and he loves you with an amazing amazing love [Music] I just want to invite you wherever you are to make an altar [Music] and to seek God In This Moment so that he can reassure you in the way that only he can that he cares for you I'm going to lead us in a prayer when I finish praying I'm gonna invite you all that may say I'd like for someone to pray with me and I'm gonna pray with you so you can bound your head you can open your eyes you can close your eyes I used to look around when they pray because I wanted to see what they were doing making sure wasn't going on out from Flynn I needed to know I wasn't sure so [Music] if that's you and you're saying I'm in that place of captivity I'm in a place where I'm trying to trust God I just want you just to lift your hand in the air Wherever You Are and that's just your way of acknowledging to God publicly that yep it's me it's me I need you I need you to show up [Music] father we just pray right now for those whose hands are lifted saying I feel like I'm in that place I feel like God you've forgotten about me I'm not quite sure how I got to where I am but God I believe and trust that you will touch me right where I am that I'm not alone in this place God the god that I'm right in the center of your hand so I'm gonna trust you with my future I'm going to trust you that you're caring for me even in this place that you see me every day and that I'm not alone in this but that you have surrounded me that your holy spirit is there to comfort me God I thank you I'm raising my hand as an acknowledgment that I trust God trust you with my whole life and I thank you right now I thank you right now put your hand down", "[Music] all right all right good morning everybody happy summer to you all uh today um hopefully you've been getting a good rest as the smoke lofts into your windows at night from the from the fire and keep keep us our firemen and prayers as well during the season tonight is our baptism at beach marker 12 at the linda hunt beach on the nahant side last week we had to uh postpone it because apparently it was dangerous to be in the water even though everybody was in the water so we there were just signs everywhere and uh so we we postponed it um out of an abundance of caution to tonight so uh everything's a go uh for tonight and so we will see you there this evening at six o'clock beach marker 12 um uh there so today we are in week 12 in our 12 steps to freedom series we're going to jump in and this step today is this yield myself to god to be used to bring the good news to others by both example and my words god wants to use you and me to help other people that is a fundamental uh part of what it means to be part of the kingdom of god is to help other people by being used that includes using your pain this idea we've talked about a little bit in this series this idea of letting god recycle your pain and taking something bad and turning it into something good instead of letting your pain be wasted let your pain be used sometimes we think that god only wants to use those exceptionally talented people but god is not a judge on american idol clear clearly clearly not a judge on american idol but god loves using ordinary people to do extraordinary things he even loves using foolish people maybe that should be our new motto east coast international church foolish people welcome that kind of idea this is what the scripture says in first corinthians take a good look friends at who you were when you got called into this life i don't see many of the brightest and best among you not many influential not many from high society families isn't it obvious that god deliberately chose men and women that the culture overlooks and exploits and abuses chose these nobodies to expose the hollow pretensions of the somebodies that makes it quite clear that none of you can get by with blowing your own horn before god everything that we have right thinking and right living a clean slate and a fresh start comes from god by way of jesus christ that's why we have the saying if you're going to blow a horn blow a trumpet for god so that's kind of one of the more modern translations of the bible right there okay but that is first question and the idea is 100 right we assume in life that god wants to use our strengths but most often god actually wants to use our weaknesses that's why he chooses ordinary people other people might overlook your honesty is extremely powerful in the kingdom as you share what you are recovering from god can use that in somebody else's life this step today is about letting is about letting yourself be used by god to bring good news to other people that's what it's about you move from being inwardly focused and selfish to outwardly focused and generous you stop being so self-absorbed about my needs and my hurts and my problems and me and you start saying how can i help other people even though i still have hurts how can i help other people and so today we're going to talk about four things to understand about a loving god and pain in our life first thing i want you to understand today is god has created us with a free will this is one of the most complicated parts of being a human right here god made you with a free will meaning you get to choose what you do you have a choice genesis chapter 1 verse 27 says god created human beings in his own image in the image of god he created them male and female he created them so how is it that you're like god how are you created in the image of god it's your ability to choose you see god gave you a choice you can choose good or you can choose bad you can choose right or you can choose wrong you can choose evil or you can choose life you can reject god or you can accept god it's your choice he will choose the right thing for you but it is still your choice whether to accept or reject that why is this well in a generic sense god didn't want just a planet of robots he could have made us all where we had no free will at all he could have forced us to bow down every day three times and pray and only choose what is right and never choose what is wrong and maybe sometimes in a dark moment of your life you wish that was the case like i wish i didn't have to choose i wish that god would just choose for me but because god is love and he wanted to create us in his own image he took the greatest risk in the universe which is to create us to love and you see love is a risk because love must be freely chosen love must be freely given and love must be freely received which means i can love someone with all my being and they never love me in return god may love you with all the parts of who he is and you still might not choose to love him this also means that i can only love somebody if i have the opportunity not to love them this is really complicated this free will thing and love and having choice but fundamentally love requires risk and if you don't want to take any risks in life then don't love anybody because love fundamentally requires risk god himself has taken the great cosmic risk of love he loves us so he gave us the ability to not love him that's called free will and free will is both a blessing and a burden because sometimes we make dumb choices and the dumb choices cause all kinds of painful consequences in our lives and in the lives of other people because authentic consequences happen with real choices that you make and real consequences to free-will choices that other people make there are consequences in our lives so it's good that i am free and that i can choose but it's tricky because sometimes frequently i choose the wrong things and that causes pain in our lives god certainly does not want us to go through the pain it's not his plan for us to go through the pain but it is part of the package that comes with free will there is a risk involved so not only does god give you a free will he gives it to everybody else too now this is this is even harder for us to get our heads around it's not just that my free will and my bad choices it's other people get a free will and they can make bad choices and good choices too and sometimes other people don't do the right thing and as a result sometimes you and i get hurt as innocent victims maybe by a parent or a spouse or a friend or a teacher whatever it is the rules of the universe that god created highlight love as the highest of values and that love requires the risk of free will fundamentally jesus often talks about this place called hell he warns people of it frequently he warns people about hell it's always so quiet when i say the word hell i wonder if that happened with jesus too when he said hell did everybody go in mark chapter 9 verse 42 on listen to what he says he's speaking hyperbolically here he's like going he's intentionally going being bigger than life here uh so that we can understand the big point which but if you cause one of these little ones who trusted me to fall into sin it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck if your hand causes you to sin cut it off it's better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell with two hands if your foot causes you to sin cut it off it's better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet and if your eye causes you to sin gouge it out it's better to enter the kingdom of god with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out i bet it was quiet when he said that i bet it was very quiet where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out jesus come on he's encouraging people to turn away from choices that will keep them in satan's dominion he's saying it's so bad to be in satan's dominion that do whatever it takes to not be there now the challenge here is if somebody's like i'm just going to cut my eye out and be done with it the problem is you would have to cut them both out and that still wouldn't work because it's not about the physical it's your heart that's messed up it's the heart that has to be adjusted and that's the point that he's making you see in the midst of this jesus is letting us know he will not force you to follow him you see he all these people that he's talking to here he wants them to follow him but he won't force it he won't require it of them oh you have to follow me you have no choice come on let's go i'm taking your free will away as a cause the cost to jesus is this jesus literally sacrifices his own life in an execution on a cross to convince us rather than force us which is the cost of true love a true love that must be freely chosen is that jesus god incarnate emmanuel god with us laid down his life so that we could freely choose to love him or not your choice so that's about free will that's a lot about why pain is in the world to begin with okay there's another 27 sermons part sermon series that could do on that but the second thing here today is god uses pain to get our attention god uses pain to get our attention pain is like the check engine light of your life like if your car is working right and the check engine goes on you're like oh man something's wrong something's wrong sometimes it's just an oxygen sensor sometimes you didn't change the oil for 70 000 miles sometimes it's you know something really really bad is going on but the check engine light or the pain is actually not the problem your anxiety your fear is not really the problem it's a warning light that there's something else deeper going on you see the pain is just a symptom of a problem it's it's a warning it's to stop and take care of this immediately right now you this pain is not supposed to be here so because you have pain you need to address the issue you need to address the situation if everything in your life is horrible and life is so painful it's a warning sign let's take care of some things it's been said god whispers to us in our pleasures but he shouts to us in our pain he's saying wake up something's wrong come on 9-1-1 do whatever it takes let's get this thing taken care of you don't leave the fire burning in your house or in the lin woods you put it out proverbs chapter 20 says sometimes it takes a painful situation to make us change our ways ah i wish that weren't true but we all know it's definitely true we don't always change when we see the light but we start to change when we feel the heat i had a pair of hiking boots that i really liked and they i was going on hikes with them and they started to fall apart which i was really upset about because they were expensive and i liked them and but the souls kept falling apart in the middle of the hike that's bad by the way because it's bad and so i'd get back home and i would repair them i would like super glue the soles back and you know the whole thing i'm like oh good i got him fixed again i would go hiking like halfway through the hike it would start to fall apart again and i kept going through this repeat cycle every time i would try to fix them i try to fix them i try to fix them and they'd fall apart finally when i was wearing them the soul uh got loose and i i tripped over a root and i tweaked my ankle because the soul that i kept trying to fix that was clearly broken got caught on that route i knew for months that i needed new boots but i did not get new boots until i experienced the pain of my poor decisions why didn't i just get boots before when i knew the whole time this is exactly what was going to happen if i didn't get new boots sometimes it just takes pain to get us going in the right direction there was an early church leader his name was paul he's kind of like a pastor kind of an overseer of a bunch of churches and he wrote to his people and he said this in second corinthians 7 i am glad not because it hurt you but because the pain turns you to god in other words it got your attention there was this guy in high school who was most likely to succeed he was a brilliant kid he lived in texas his dad was a millionaire he had everything at his fingertips the most popular kid in the city he grew up to become a semi-pro golfer a great businessman mr charisma and charm and then he got into cocaine then he started dealing cocaine then he got thrown into federal penitentiary and while he was there in prison he gave his life to jesus and when he came out of that prison he started a ministry called exodus ministry that helps ex-cons reactivate themselves into society and he said this he said the greatest thing that happened to me was going to prison that's not you know that's maybe counterintuitive maybe that's not what you think but the greatest thing for him was that going to prison because it was painful and god used that problem and pain to get his attention and god uses problems and pain when we encounter them to get our attention it's not that god caused the pain it's that he takes the pain and uses it there's another there's a guy in the bible named jonah somebody say jonah it's just a just a great name jonah was going one way and he was running from god god had asked him to do something he didn't want to do it he didn't like the people that he was supposed to go talk to and so he runs from god and he runs the way and god says i want you to go this way and he's like i want to go that way and so god provides jonah with an unusual mediterranean cruise for him all expenses paid inside the belly of an ancient great big fish literally he he falls overboard a giant fish the bible says comes swallows him and he's in the belly of this ancient giant fish you know usually when you get swallowed by a giant fish you die all hope was lost but that's not happened jonah didn't die there he is in the belly of a whale or a fish or whatever it was and jonas said because he did live and he did eventually go do what god wanted him to do he said when i had lost all hope i once again turned my thoughts to the lord why does it take us to lose all hope to turn our thoughts to the lord it would probably be wiser and much less painful when all things were going good my thoughts were on the lord but the pain created an opportunity for jonah to get right with god and if that's what it takes then that's what god will use third thing is pain teaches us to depend on god second corinthians one says we were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure and we thought we would never live through it think about that have you had that kind of pain where you never thought you would live through it in fact we expected to die but as a result we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on god who raised the dead and he did rescue us from mortal danger and he will rescue us again we have placed our confidence in him and he will continue to rescue us you see there is an interesting moment in our faith journey in god's kingdom where you don't know that god is all you need until god is literally all you have and then you find out that that is actually all you need that god has everything you need and when you've lost it all and it's falling apart you don't know that god's all you need until until you realize he's all you got and it's more than enough if you've never had a problem if you've never if you had never had a problem you would never know that god could solve them but in the midst of our pain god captures the pain and he uses it to teach us to depend on him what satan was trying to use to kill you god uses to bless you and empower you the psalmist says like this in psalm 119 my suffering was good for me i hate that my suffering was good for me for it taught me to pay attention to your decrees why does it take the suffering again going all the way back to free will my suffering was good for me for it taught me to pay attention to your degrees the truth is that some things we only learn through pain for some of us it's the only time we ever learn anything is through pain it's it's that hot stove principle in life almost everyone has burned themselves at least a little on a hot stove even though nearly everybody has been told from the earliest of ages never touch a hot stove we know we're not supposed to do it but somehow it just seems to happen but once you get burned on a hot stove the pain teaches you don't ever do that again the people that get burned the second time that's a whole different conversation right there that's a whole time so the pain teaches us the fourth thing here is god will use your pain to give you a message and a ministry you see god uses pain that you have in your life and he takes that pain and he transforms it he transforms it into a message and a ministry in your life not just a message i want to land here on this first just a second not just a message but also a ministry people say this to me all the time pastor kirk you know i i was on the streets you know i've been i was an addict for a long time and i've been you know i've been clean for a few weeks now i just want to tell my story like great everybody in the church is in the same boat all right like what do you mean like almost everybody in the church has a story like this what we need is both a message and a ministry it's not just enough to say what god has done it's the the morphing that from a message into a ministry where you're you're developing people and working with people and helping people and assisting people in an ongoing stable consistent fashion that changes the world and that's what we're doing here that's why 21 years later we're here is that consistency and that's what this step is really all about that message and the ministry it's yielding myself to god to help other people in an ongoing fashion see the pain in life the truth is that the pain in life prepares us to serve when you give it to god but if you don't give that pain to god he can't use it because god comforts us in our pain and in that comforting in our pain he teaches us then how to give comfort to others who are in pain ii corinthians says he comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others see that that's good when they are troubled he will be able to give them the same comfort god has given us we will be able to everybody everybody needs recovery of some type mental recovery physical recovery spiritual recovery social recovery relational recovery everybody needs it everybody has a hurt or a habit or a hang-up there's absolutely nobody in the world that's perfect and just think about that for a second if nobody is perfect and everybody needs recovery then what i have gone through god can use because somebody will need it who can better help an alcoholic than somebody who struggled with alcoholism who can better help somebody dealing with the pain of abuse than somebody who was abused themselves who can better help somebody who lost their job and went bankrupt and somebody who lost their job and went bankrupt who can better help a couple of parents who have a child a teenager who's going off the deep end than somebody who's gone through that themselves you see if we will take the pain that we experience in life and give it to god god will take that pain use it and recycle the pain in your life to help other people but you've got to be honest about it and open with it and if you keep that hurt and that pain to yourself you are wasting an opportunity for god to redeem your pain there are things that some of you have lived with for most of your life that are deeply painful to you and they will continue to be deeply painful to you until you release them to god for god to take that turn it around and force that pain to bless you and to bless other people there is a beautiful story in the bible in the book of genesis it's the story of joseph here's here's a guy named joseph who was mistreated by all the people just mistreated people did horrible things to this guy but he was a good guy he didn't deserve this pain in his life he was a godly young man one day all 11 of his brothers decided to gang up on him and sell their brother into slavery that's not very nice and then they went back home and told their dad that their youngest brother their brother had been eaten by a lion you thought your family was dysfunctional this is taking it to the next level right here so there there joseph is sold into slavery taken from israel into egypt into a whole other country he sold into slavery there he's doing a slave job keeping his life pure before god and his master's wife now tries to seduce him and he says no that wouldn't be right and so she cries rape and he's falsely accused of rape and thrown into prison for something he didn't do he's a slave now imprisonously this whole guy's life is downhill all the way but god uses every negative situation and every pain in joseph's life to raise him up to eventually become the number two the second in command for the entire nation of egypt it's a phenomenal story you should read it and because joseph let him god uses joseph to save not only one but two nations from destruction and famine sometime later the brothers of joseph come to joseph to get some food not fully understanding that it was joseph they figured out and they expect joseph to have their heads cut off like it's it's it this is payback time for joseph there they all are ready in front of him they he can do whatever he wants he's the second in charge in the whole nation in genesis chapter 50 verse 20 we get this absolutely life challenging verse or statement from joseph joseph says this to his brothers who sold him into slavery that changed his whole life you intended to harm me but god intended it all for good he brought me to this position so i could save the lives of many people there's a lot going on behind this but listen as the worship team comes up god is bigger than any people that have hurt you god is bigger than any pain that it has caused and today and every day if you will give that pain to god no matter what other people have done to you no matter what god will turn it around and use it for good he will turn it around tell your neighbor he will turn it around you see you can waste a hurt if you want the hurts in life you can waste them and let them continue to fester and be painful and if you don't learn from those hurts and if you don't learn to share that with other people by giving it to god and letting him use you then it will continue to fester it will continue to destroy you but if you will give those hurts and pains to god god promises he will never waste a hurt in your life he will take that pain and he will redeem that pain and he will make it something good for your future and for other people you see i know this today i know that for many of you whether just to click on youtube and watch the service today or over in revere or here in lynn the fact that you are breathing today is a miracle if everybody around you knew everything that you've had to overcome just to be here today we would all stand and thank god thank god for the miracles in your life it's truly a miracle and i want you to get this today you are not just a miracle you are somebody else's miracle you see the fact that you're here breathing is an opportunity for you to now go help somebody else you are somebody else's miracle god doesn't want to just heal you he wants to use you to heal somebody else and in so doing he's healing you even more see your story of pain your story of redemption your story of hope will be somebody else's lifeline to freedom and when you start to be somebody else's lifeline to freedom you recognize that you are finally and truly free yourself would you stand with me as we close today [Music] so what do we do with this first off today give your pain to jesus there is no need for you to carry it alone give it to jesus and let him redeem it give your story to jesus jesus already knows your story but go ahead and give it to him anyhow jesus you can do whatever you want with my pain you can do whatever you want with my story they belong to you redeem what the enemy has taken from me bring healing into my life and let this message and make me a message and give me a ministry to serve you and to help others be free that's the point today that's the point today as the worship team leads us in this song let's just respond to that however you'd like the altars are open let's spend some time giving this to jesus today", "everyone i'm christina and i'm pastor emily and i'm on staff at east coast international church and this is our holy week podcast this week we're going to be taking a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it [Music] it's not oh it is hey everyone guys sorry about that novice podcasters here so happy thursday happy thursday actually it's not really it's it's monday thursday yeah the one that's pretending to be monday correct yes yes what does monday mean again it's like somber or something like that right i don't know today yeah so i mean i hope you guys have a good day happy thursday to you all um but as we're looking into jesus's tracking his footsteps during holy week it definitely was not a happy thursday for him so yeah no not maybe not relatable to the happy thursday yeah but you know it is relatable i'm exhausted me too and jesus must have been exhausted as well i bet and he's about to pull an all-nighter too yup exactly which leads us right into kind of the start of the day yep the start of the all of the scriptures that talk about what happened and what transpired on monday thursday during holy week they really all start in the evening monday means washing of feet really yeah not at all what i thought me neither but that is cool because that happens yeah we're gonna talk we're gonna talk a little bit about that about that we had just just we were just saying do we have too much content should we cut the foot washing part we gotta read it now yeah all right it's decided so anyway so the passages that talk about what jesus is doing they start off with um preparation for the passover which is a special meal that happened at did you say twilight i said dusk do they mean the same thing just when it's starting to get dark yeah i think twilight is the night time getting dark and dusk is the morning time getting light i thought that was dawn just kidding desk to dawn right like never mind i don't know what i'm twilight dusk so there's the same thing yeah yeah all right so just like wednesday if you joined us for the podca cast yesterday we talked a little bit about how wednesday was probably a day of rest and preparation for jesus and truth is so was thursday but so much happened thursday night and actually like really what we see isn't all like an all-nighter here yeah um that we're gonna really kind of jump in with the content on thursday night but before we do i just wanted to point out this little miracle that jesus does that has to do with the preparation for the passover because i just think it's so cool a lot of the miracles that jesus does are very missional and like like just they're just great i was gonna say grandiose but that almost sounds like like he's putting on a show like tongue-in-cheek yeah but i don't mean like they weren't that great i mean they really were like grand great miracles and healings and things like that but there's just this like little miracle on wendy thursday that just makes me feel i don't know like kind of safe and comfortable thinking about where jesus tells peter and john to go into jerusalem and he just tells them exactly what they're going to see they're going to see a guy carrying a picture they're gonna follow that guy you know they're just gonna see him in the street they're gonna ask him where is the room where the master can celebrate the passover meal with his friends and that guy has a big room available that's already set up wow and it's just like a cool little one it's nice i don't know i feel like it's kind of a cool little that is cool i like that it's kind of sweet like those are those are the kind of miracles that you always hope for right like but yeah you show up and it's it's already ready for you yeah yeah and sometimes that happens sometimes jesus does that it's nice other times you have to do the work and set things up yourself oh that makes me feel even more tired but every once in a while i mean i just i just thought that was a cool moment so anyway so it's day of preparation and um and now we're at the passover meal which we when we think of passover as christians we think of this specific night but when jesus and his disciples were thinking of passover they were not thinking of this night they were thinking of a night that happened probably like several hundred years prior yeah and they were celebrating the passover and love of unleavened bread which was part of jewish tradition um and christina do you want to talk to us a little bit about what the old testament meaning of passover was for the disciples yes so the very first time that we find the festival of unleavened bread and the passover is in exodus 12 and it's when the israelites are fleeing from egypt and so basically it's the final plague um the the the angel of death is about to um is it the angel of death yeah okay she gave me a look i was like what um is about to come and uh kill the firstborn of all the egyptian uh homes and so god is uh sort of preparing them for this preparing them to leave and he's telling them roast a lamb make unleavened bread which is bread without yeast so it's it's not gonna rise um and basically eat with your shoes on eat with your shirt tucked in it says it's like be ready to leave you with urgency um and also when you take the lamb to roast it take blood and um paint it on your door sills so that when when i come i'll pass over your houses this will be the sign that um i need to pass over and so so your firstborn will be spared um and then uh and then like they go they leave and they're out of there and the important thing is that this is something that they'll do every year in remembrance of this moment when god delivered them from egypt and it's something that they're to pass on to their children to teach them the story and tell them how god delivered them and so they do this every year they have a piece of unleavened bread and so for seven days there is like they have to take the east out of their house like there's supposed to be no yeast at all whatsoever anywhere all the bread is cooked without yeast um like some people go as far as to like use q-tips and stuff to like clean really cracks and crevices and stuff which i don't know who uses that much yeast but again good point that is a lot of use but yeah they'll like follow that really um some of them more more untraditional yeah jews will follow that really closely and carefully yeah yeah yeah so for hundreds of years they were doing this and passing it on to their children um and so this is what jesus and his disciples are are doing as well yeah very cool i was i was thinking about um did you read when you were looking into the old testament stuff christina did you read about how um [Music] moses had told pharaoh that the one of the reasons why they couldn't offer sacrifices and worship their god in egypt is because the way that they worshipped was considered detestable and that the egyptians would have like killed them in the streets if they saw their sacrifices oh no yeah there's this like little verse um in exodus that that talks about that which is really interesting because like the egyptians would have thought it was detestable yeah that the egyptians would have it's it says that the egyptian moses said because pharaoh was like why do you guys need to go out into the wilderness just stay here and worship your god here yeah and he said no like if we do that you know the way that we sacrifice your egyptians will stone us in the streets yeah um and so i was reading this article that was pointing out how even the act of sacrificing the lamb and cooking the lamb and using the blood over the door like the like the door frame and whatever like that in and of itself was an act of faith for the israelites because it was kind of like i believe that my god is going to be victorious because if i did this on any other day in egypt like people would come after me and mobs would just kill me because this is so like culturally unacceptable at that time in egypt but god had told them to do it and so they were being obedient and it was like their homes were literally marked by their faith you know their willingness to be obedient even at the risk of of death but like choosing to be obedient to god even with high stakes like that yeah which i just thought was kind of interesting because the so the passover that they were celebrating this like pre-dates the temple it predates the tabernacle it predates the covenant of sinai so like animal sacrifices from the old testament they weren't like a common thing although they were kind of that was happening all over the world right but they had days like received the commandments to do it it was a regular practice yeah it was just kind of like an expression of their people right yeah so anyways really interesting i think that if you wanted to anybody who's ever done like a a seder like a passover seder meal in um kind of jewish tradition you learn a lot more about this and even more if you do it under the guidance of a messianic jew somebody who is a jew and practices and understands jewish tradition but believes in jesus as well there's so much depth to the act of you know this meal in and of itself um that you could really delve into we're not gonna get to go too too deep but just know that the context of this night and what kind of began to transpire was that jesus sat down knowing that he was gonna die now we're talking about think about it like i mean let's just like say a time and what time is twilight right sundown is like roughly at what time i mean i know it changes from place to place but i always think six but that might be a little early okay so if if we were to go with six which i think probably is a little bit early jesus died on good friday and nine a.m so that means that jesus died just what 15 hours later and he knows what's happening like he's not like unaware of what's going on so 15 hours before he is about to be you know brutally murdered he sits down to celebrate this ancient jewish tradition with his closest companions yeah and it's again it just it call i'm calling back kind of this theme of intentionality on jesus's part this whole week like he is facing something absolutely horrific and as you read the gospels about how how jesus was doing um this thursday evening like he was in distress he was um troubled like there are a lot of verses that kind of talk about how his spirit was troubled or he was in distress or whatever um but he's still making all of these choices to be obedient to fulfill the prophecies to say yes to god's will even when it's incredibly hard and you just see his character like what is the thing that he wants to spend his time doing in his last moments of freedom he wants to spend his time with his friends he wants to spend his time sharing how he loves them and telling them important things that they're going to need to know when he's gone and he wants to spend time praying sorry so yeah really really i think really beautiful picture of jesus but okay so they're they're eating the passover meal together and right before they get into eating jesus decides that he is going to wash their feet and so i'm going to read this passage from john chapter 13. um about exactly how that went down john's the only one who captured this incredible story by the way which i was um i thought was kind of interesting john john definitely was an interesting guy john yeah thanks john john chapter 13 verse 1 before the passover celebration jesus knew that his hour had come to leave this world and returned to his father he had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth and now he loved them to the very end it was time for supper and the devil had already prompted judas son of simon iscariot to betray jesus jesus knew that the father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from god and would return to god so i mean let me just recap that so jesus knew that he had all authority and so it says in light of that verse 4 so he got up from the table took off his robe wrapped a towel around his waist and poured water into a basin and then he began to wash the disciples feet drying them with a towel he had around him when jesus came to simon peter peter said to him lord are you going to wash my feet jesus replied you don't understand now what i'm doing but someday you will no peter pro protested you'll never ever wash my feet jesus replied unless i wash you you won't belong to me simon peter exclaimed then wash my hands and head as well lord not just my feet jesus replied a person who has bathed all over does not need to wash except for the feet to be entirely clean and you disciples are clean but not all of you for jesus knew who would betray him yeah that is what he meant when he said not all of you are clean after washing their feet he put on his robe again and sat down and asked do you understand what i was doing you call me teacher and lord and you are right because that's what i am and since i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you ought to wash each other's feet too i've given you an example to follow do as i have done to you i tell you the truth slaves are not greater than their master nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message now that you know these things god will bless you for doing them i love the way that jesus was again here taking this really intentional moment to say all right i'm together with my loved ones and this is how i want them to see me this is how i want them to remember me something that i want them to think of forever in no uncertain terms knowing all that he was entitled to right like as that verse says knowing that he came from the father and would return to the father and that you know everything was going to belong to him that he chose to wash their feet i think that that's like a really big teaching point that jesus presented um for them you kind of see it echoed and a lot of the other things that he said throughout the evening but um i want to make sure that we have time to cover everything so let's continue on with the events of the evening after the foot washing um hopefully he washed his hands [Laughter] the gospels don't tell us but i'm just gonna guess he did and they sat down to eat and so they're having their passover meal together and this is when jesus predicts his betrayal yeah he's like whoever dips their bread in my in the cup i guess they dipped their bread in juice right is that a thing they did yeah oh no yes is it juice i don't anyways um i just imagined them dipping it in grape juice for some reason but is that where they were dipping it or was it like a sauce on the side i don't know if i got that in there and chick-fil-a sauce with them [Music] the original chick-fil-a oh you know it probably would be more like olive oil would make more sense than chick-fil-a maybe it was i don't know but anyways they were dipping their bread in something and jesus was like whoever dips their bread in the cup at the same time as me he's the one who will betray me and so there's um there's something in the psalms when david was writing the psalms and jesus refers back to this he says to fulfill this prophecy which is interesting because i don't know if david knew that he was prophesying when he was reading the psalms but yeah but we see jesus say that this uh several times like in order to fulfill the prophecy and then he quotes from one of david's psalms yeah very interesting um and i think that a lot of things that happened to david were kind of like a an archetype is that you call it david was an archetype yeah jesus um and so basically david writes this um this verse about how he is being betrayed by the people he shared bread with um and that's in psalm 41 and then also uh in psalm 55 it talks about how uh david is being um uh he's being pursued but he's being pursued by his friends by the people he had walked to the house of the lord with and worshiped with and communed with and and that makes it all the more like hurtful yeah and um during during the time that david wrote those psalms he had just gone through the whole war with his son son absalom his advisor hitha phil had left him had betrayed him um and then some crazy man shebo was trying to start an uprising against him against him and so david was going through a bunch of stuff and it was like people close to him were were starting to betray him um and so jesus is referencing back to these verses and saying that um that this is like him like people close to him or betraying him in jesus um judas who had been with jesus this whole time was about to betray him yeah i think it's really interesting the way jesus treats judas yeah you could probably do a study just on that but i like i think that if jesus had judged and condemned judas i could imagine him like just rejecting judas completely and yet jesus is like almost almost like pleadingly interacting with judas this whole time like he's like you see him even here like he says to judas like go do what you yeah go do what you're gonna do and the rest of the disciples don't even know what jesus like right it says that oh judas was a treasure so the disciples thought he like had to go buy something or pay for the food or something they didn't even realize what jesus was saying but jesus is having this like very public because it's in front of everybody and so you can tell like he wasn't like being emotionally like hatred hate like hateful or anything towards judas all right so much so that the disciples didn't know like what was going on right i know in the matthew pat said she he says friend go do what you have to do yeah yeah and he keeps he keeps talking like it's like jesus is like convicting him and reaching out to him at the same time and even in the garden when judas comes to betray him like it's like the same thing it's there's something about jesus that is so fascinating to me in his interaction with judas because i think i think that god's grace is big enough even for judas you know i mean we know that it that that judas was not able to handle live with himself you know right and jesus predicted that but it's not because of jesus's disgust with judas or hatred towards him or frustration with him that judas's life ends so poorly right it even he like he was like i shed innocent blood like it was his guilt that killed him not right like because he knew jesus was good right yeah yeah so there's that betrayal prediction that happens in this kind of interaction with like public yet private interaction with judas and then um we see jesus establishing the tradition of communion which we continue to celebrate today specifically because jesus told us to keep celebrating it yeah but communion is such an interesting concept i think like jesus took a meal and then did something very spiritual and significant with it which is why this whole meal like the passover with old testament meanings and the fact that it was the night before jesus died and it's jesus himself eating it and he establishes this new testament like tradition and kind of speaks about the new testament covenant this meal is like so deep so deep so much going on here yeah yeah um so i know that jesus talked about his blood and and his flesh and communion and we're not gonna get too deep into it because we do talk about communion and read these passages every time that we take it together as a church which we just did recently and we're going to do again tomorrow good friday service together but one of the things we don't get to explore a lot is the concept of covenant that jesus is really saying like hey this sacrifice of my own flesh and blood it seals this new covenant that we have going that he talks about in mark yeah yeah there there's uh mark 14 24 references a new covenant and this is just a really pivotal moment to me i am just fascinated with this because it's like for years they have been under the old covenant and the old testament laws and sacrifices and everything um and then jesus just like vastly changes everything and is like there's there's going to be a new covenant but what's really cool is that the old testament talks about this and so for example um in jeremiah 31 it talks about how god will establish a new covenant covenant and it won't be like the one that he established with with israel's ancestors when they came out of egypt um he he says that he will put the law in their minds and write it on their hearts that he will be their god and that they won't have to teach their neighbors about knowing the lord because everyone will know god and i think that's really cool because when jesus dies the veil is torn there's a new covenant everyone can be in relationship with jesus they don't have to go to the high priest and the law is written in their hearts and their minds and ezekiel 25 also talks about this it talks about them being cleansed which reminds me of what jesus said to peter with the foot washing yeah that if he washes him um then he'll be he'll be he'll belong to jesus and so ezekiel 25 says that they'll be cleansed with water that their sins will be washed away that he will turn their heart of stone into a heart of flesh and he'll put his spirit inside of them and this is the new covenant and and his spirit will will move them to follow his laws and to follow his decrees and so uh basically i see like hardened people in the old testament who had to follow all of these laws um and there was a relationship with god but it was distant you had to go to the high priest and i could see them kind of getting worn down kind of being come becoming corrupt kind of becoming rigid and if they're following the laws then it's more of like a religious like this is what we have to do because of tradition and jesus kind of with his new covenant takes that all away and gives um give us gives us a living heart and a heart that seeks after his laws and that naturally has it like written in our hearts and our minds because it's good to serve god it's it's a wonderful thing um for us to serve god and so that just makes me so happy every time every time i think about that every time i think about that heart of flesh as opposed to the heart of stone that that god would give me a heart and that he would put the holy spirit inside of me to want to follow him and that's what jesus is doing here with the new covenant yeah absolutely jesus also mentioned kind of just piggybacking on what you're saying about the community he mentioned how he wouldn't eat or drink again like this until the the kingdom of god was fulfilled until its meaning was fulfilled in the kingdom of god and i don't i just think it's so interesting whenever i think about communion i love that name communion i don't think that name is actually in the bible but the concept is there which is this idea that jesus invited us to become one with him in in this new way of living and to be kind of one with him you know in in what he did for us on the cross and the example that he set and you know to be a part of this new kingdom that he was establishing right he's the messiah the coming king and he's saying like here like drink my you know drink my blood and eat my flesh like and i won't do this again until you know we're together in a kingdom and so yeah this idea of just communion like being with and united together with jesus is such a powerful thing and it is really what we're walking out and living out day to day but the bread and the bread and the wine are these symbols that we remind ourselves of the fact that the lives that we live and the things that we do we do them in communion with christ we are the body of christ and we have become one with him and his purposes on the earth and so um really really deep stuff powerful stuff we could spend a lot more time talking about it but we got to move on after the meal that they shared they began moving to the garden of gethsemane which was a beautiful garden that was in the mount of olives um and we had talked about the mount of olives before but so they're walking along to the garden of gethsemane and as they're on their way there jesus is talking to them he's like you know can't can't miss his opportunities to share the things that he wants to share it's like you can tell he's he's got so much to say and and he even said that to them like there's i have so much more to tell you but the spirit is coming and the spirit you know will lead you into all truth um but one of the things that he talked about was how they were all going to desert him and he predicted that and um yeah and he quotes zechariah 13 7 which is another old testament passage kind of talking about turmoil to come it says the the shepherd would be um struck and that the sheep would scatter and so he's like you guys you guys are gonna scatter you're gonna leave me yeah and i feel like it's so kind of him to tell them because it's kind of like listen i know this is gonna happen guys it's like because can you imagine if you were following jesus and then in the last moments before he died you betrayed him you deserted him you abandoned him you denied him and then he died and then you wondered like are we still good like is that it did i just in the very final moments of my opportunity to like love him and serve him and obey him i turned away from him like i would have been an absolute despair you know and kind of see that with peter and his wrestle but jesus is letting them know like guys i know what's going on i understand these things i know what's going to happen the scriptures are going to be fulfilled and this is how it is you know and peter is of course like no god like if everyone else denies you if everyone else abandons you if everyone else turns their back on you like i never will and he's like the most confident of them all and um man jesus just deals with him so perfectly again the same way he kind of deals with judas with this kind of like convicting this gentle convicting um and yet like this love and reaching out to him and i wanted to read a couple verses in luke 22 where jesus is talking to him jesus says simon simon again he switches back to simon's to peter's original name simon and instead of using his name peter that he had renamed him with but simon simon satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat but i have pleaded in prayer for you simon that your faith should not fail so when you have repented and turned to me again strengthen your brothers and i just love that because it's like simon did fail simon denied jesus and we all we all um probably have heard the story right he said you'll deny me three times before the rooster grows and he's like no and then he does it three times then he doesn't realize and the rooster crows and he's you know super upset about that because he realizes he really did turn his back on jesus but jesus is so clear here yeah he's like there's spiritual warfare going on satan wants to turn you all away from me he wants to have you for himself but i've prayed for you and i i pray that you your faith will not fail and but then he says when you've repented and turned to me again strengthen your brothers and i was reading this commentary that just said um when it comes to faith we need to remember that an eclipse is not extension extinction if your faith is eclipsed in a moment if you falter in your faith if you have moments where you are struggling or you turn your back on jesus or whatever the case may be that is not the same as completely losing your faith altogether you just prayed that peter wouldn't fail and so he just says listen when you repent and you turn back to me i've got work for you to do strengthen your brothers and he's just like he knows he sees it all already um and so he's just talking to them and dealing with them in regards to all of these things um he continues to talk to them in that passage about how um you know it's important for them to have swords um which we could go like into that a ton but he's basically saying remember when i sent you all out to do ministry and um i told you not to bring anything with you and they're like yeah and he's like this time bring stuff with you like it's basically kind of like i feel like it's him just saying like things are about to get real like this is not a short-term missions trip now like this is boom your reality is about to be again your new reality of being my disciples who are persecuted and who are not loved by the world but who have an incredible calling is about to begin and so things are going to be dangerous yeah um but yeah so okay so they're on their way to the garden um john chapters 14 to 17 some of my favorite chapters in the bible um is just it's what is it three four chapters of jesus talking to the disciples and it's so deep if you want to read something today read john 14 to 17. it's powerful beautiful jesus prays for you um he prays over us john 17 and is when he prays yeah he prays yeah so good um and he like he's he's you it records one of jesus's prayer and he says i'm not i'm praying not just for the disciples that are here with me but for everyone who will ever believe i know every time i see that i'm like that's me yeah um so i love that i love hearing like you know oh jesus pray for me it's really cool but um so a lot of things happen they're on their way to gethsemane they get to the garden and jesus wants to spend time in prayer and he talks about how he is troubled and his soul is is is stricken with grief to the point of feeling crushed and so he goes through these this three cycles of prayer he goes to pray he's kind of like off on his own but he kind of asked his disciples to back him up and they kept falling asleep and luke tells us that they were falling asleep because they were exhausted with grief so jesus is like in turmoil the disciples are in turmoil they realize like wow something is going down jesus is talking about dying he's talking about being betrayed he's talking about us all deserting him and it's in that context that he asks them to stay awake and by the way this is late at night yeah he asks them to stay awake and pray with him that's rough and so there's spiritual warfare going on and then they just keep falling asleep and he keeps saying listen guys like this the the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak stay awake watch and pray so that you won't fall into temptation because he knows that he's about to go through a huge testing but so are they yeah and they need to prepare as well and so they have this incredible time of prayer in the garden and you can just see jesus's humanity on full display along with his obedience his obedience is on full display if you're ever like wrestling with a sin or something really really hard in your life and you just feel like you can't bear it like read these passages because jesus understands he's been through it and he set this example for you and take encouragement from it um but so jesus has this incredible prayer time and then judas comes and you know the the um notorious kiss of judas to greet jesus and indicate who needed to be arrested to the people he had betrayed him to um and jesus responds he gets arrested there's a sword fight there's so many things that happen um in this moment there's even even this one of the gospels records how jesus says who are you looking for and they're like jesus from nazareth and he says i am and they all fall back yes right and then and then he's like well who are you looking for and like he says it again um when i read that passage i think of like a like a voiceover movie kind of like kung pao but like who are you looking for and then they're like jesus and then he's like i am and then they're like i'm sorry that's that's my mentor i see yes they're you know pushed back by this kung fu force yeah okay got it what is it with us in martial arts like no okay anyway um yes so jesus allows them to arrest him peter tries to defend him by cutting off somebody's ear and jesus is like no peter like i told you to get swords but like this is not what you needed it for if i needed help i could call thousands of angels good point um oh and so yeah so and then as jesus is being arrested exactly what he said comes to pass all of his disciples desert him they all run away and um a couple of them like tried to follow him and see what was going down so that takes us to this the council that this very official you know court case that happened in the dead of night in someone's home i'm saying official like tongue and like i'm being sarcastic in case you can't tell over the podcast it's a super sketchy thing that the religious leaders did because they were trying to figure out how to kill him trying to figure out how to do it without turning the crowds against them because everyone loved jesus so they decide to meet overnight in the high priest's home and they have a bunch of witnesses nobody can come up with anything that jesus has done that would merit any kind of punishment and they even didn't they like hire people to give testimonies yeah like even they they were messing up with that because their testimonies weren't meeting they were contradicting one another yeah they were like it was a mess it was it was it was so i mean so stupid it and like i was like like who has like the energy for this stuff right because they're they're pulling an all-nighter just to like yeah really this whole thing is happening in the dead of night they're having this long trial they're trying to figure out how to get rid of jesus and he's just being quiet and just letting them do their thing and like say all these horrible things about him that aren't true yeah and so finally what is it the thing that they nab him on they say well are you the messiah yeah and he just like yeah he uh he quotes three old testament passages in one he's like what is he i am you will see this on a man and coming on the clouds of glory and that's exodus 3 14 daniel 7 13 and psalm 110 1 all together all passages about a like a messiah figure a very like like a god god it's god he's like yes yes yes he says yes by quoting the old testament passages to them he doesn't say anything else and they're like well we've heard enough blasphemy let's kill him just to me it's like wow like they murdered jesus for quoting their scriptures for identifying himself as you know the person that their scriptures foretold yeah which is is just so um it's like right in their faces he's like this is it yeah that's what you've been reading and waiting for all these years i'm here i'm quoting these scriptures like take the sign and they're like nope that's the reason we're gonna kill him right it's it's tragic is what it is it's tragic it's ironic it's just like the most unfair um trial court case if you could even call it that that you could imagine and then like the worst reason to try to get rid of somebody that just doesn't even make sense i mean just history looks back on this moment and says like yeah this is this is messed up but the thing about it is that i think what happened with jesus you we really cannot get overly specific and say like oh it was you know caiaphas is the worst human that ever lived and judas is the worst like because when you get overly specific and you try to blame on these specific people you are missing out on the fact that this is the death of jesus rests in the hands of humanity like it rests in our hands and these people and all of their errors and all of their mistakes they are any one of us could be guilty of these things if we were just pushed a little bit further down the path of sin yeah um so i mean it's tragic and it's horrific and at the same time it's kind of like yeah i mean that's a good point that's that's how humidity is like when we get upset and we get frustrated and we don't like what's going on we feel insulted or jealous or scared or whatever like we'll look for reasons we'll look for excuses to do the unthinkable you know we'll justify what we're doing yeah um so yeah and then they beat him and begin and that's where the the torture and the humiliation began they began beating him and saying prophesy jesus tell us who hit you um which it's probably around 4 a.m at this time 4 or 5 a.m because it's they're beating him just before dawn so all of this happened from like sun down to dawn everything that we just spoke about um and so that is technically that probably was in the wee hours of friday morning um so we've already started into the happenings of good friday but that is monday thursday in a nutshell watching the fee yeah all right let's pray to close this out yeah all right dear jesus thank you so much for everything that you've done i feel like my prayer is so small in the midst of everything we just read god but i i thank you jesus um and i thank you that you became the sacrificial lamb and i thank you that you you prayed over us and that you loved your disciples well and that that's a demonstration of how you love us well god and and i pray that we would um that we would never take lightly this this thing that you did for us god that it would never get old god but that we would have um hearts of flesh that are living and that are drawn to drawn to you god and uh drawn to an understanding of who you are and what you've done and i pray that we would never be blinded holy spirit i pray that you would help us to put aside our human tendencies and to take on a perspective that you give us god that is from you god that we would be able to see you in every every day and not grow cold hearted like the pharisees were here god um that", " we would just uh see as you would have us see god and i pray that you would uh lead us in your ways god help us to continue to be drawn closer and closer to you god use us to share this story with others lord and god i just pray for every person listening to this podcast that you would bless them today lord in your name i pray amen all right thank you so much guys for listening [Music] that you died [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] of all is children", "[Music] [Music] [Music] oh no no no no [Music] oh oh no no no no [Music]", "good morning welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting prayer podcast this is day two and i want to welcome you i am pastor dave and i am recording these podcasts by the way directly from my home so welcome once again and we're gonna jump right into today's topic and it's something that's really been stirring in my heart since i first started preparing for prayer and fasting in this this podcast and today's topic is spiritual decluttering spiritual decluttering and today's topic comes from romans 12 2. romans chapter 12 verse 2 and this is what it says don't copy the behavior and customs of this world but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know god's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect there's a lot going on in this verse that i just love and as i was preparing i had this picture in my mind and i had this idea of decluttering and i don't know if you remember the last time you did a deep decluttering project at home or in your backyard i recently was in that position i had to clear an old backyard on one of our properties and you know there's a lot of junk buried beneath the surface there were old mattresses and tree branches and old tree tires and there was just there was just a lot going on and when i was calculating okay how much space do we need in a dumpster because i was planning to order one i thought that there's no way we're going to need a 20 yarder because there can't possibly be that much junk but against my gut i thought you know better safe than sorry so i ordered the 20 yarder and wouldn't you know it within a couple of hours of putting trash into that dumpster it was full almost to the top and it was getting ready to overflow and a lot of times in our spiritual walk this is what happens you know we're going about our lives and we think we're not doing that bad you know i know i need to work on a few things and i know that i have needs and i know that i could use god you know in these areas but you know i'm not that bad off and but it's in these moments when we pause to enter a time of prayer and searching the things of god and and fasting and things like this where it becomes abundantly clear that there's a lot of junk collecting underneath the surface many times in our hearts in our lives and when we go into a time of prayer all these things have a way of of coming to the surface because god wants to set us free and that's exactly what happens because you see god is always speaking the bible is very clear about this that you know in the in the old testament god spoke through the prophets there were these men and women of god that god used and but the bible is clear that in the last days and in these days god is speaking to us through his son jesus through the life of jesus and he's always speaking to us but we are not always attentive because a lot of times there's a lot of clutter in our lives that is in the way and even though god is clearly speaking and he has made his will known to us because of sin because of the worldly clutter the the influence and how susceptible we are to influence a lot of times we think you know what i'm pretty impervious you know the world doesn't really affect me that much but if you look closely the customs of this world the behaviors of this world our language our responses our opinions we're more susceptible to influence than we would like to admit and so all of that creates this effect where god's clear voice becomes like that that charlie brown teacher voice you remember like you know you're not hearing clearly but it's not because of god it's because we have walked away from god we have drawn away from him and we need to get back and we need to we need to say god i i know that i need to i need your help to deal with some of these things so that i can have more room in my life and so when it comes to fasting that's the idea we want to make room for god and so whatever it is that you're fasting whether you're fasting tv or all your favorite foods or certain meals or you know anything else that you are you're kind of setting aside for this season of fasting that's what you're doing you you want god's voice to become clear to you and you want to hear from him and you want to be set free and you'll also notice that god cares deeply about your your life you need god's care in so many areas and sometimes we just want to plow through but we really need god to minister to us to cleanse us to help us to empower us to set us free and so we're going to close with a time of prayer but i want you to think about what are the things in your life that are making god's voice indistinguishable in your life because there are so many things that are louder in your life that maybe god is using in this in this moment he's using this time to speak to you and and says hey listen i want you to set that thing aside for a season and just focus on me and let's declutter when we do this it says then you will learn to know god's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect god wants to change the way we think and that happens through prayer so let's pray god i thank you so much that your spirit does this cleansing decluttering work in our lives and i pray god that today as we're praying you would change the way that we think that you would give us the courage to let go of the behaviors and the customs of this world would you transform us would you change the way that we think so that we can live a free and empowered life we pray all these things in jesus mighty name amen amen well we'll see you again tomorrow and let's keep praying let's keep seeking god's voice we'll see you tomorrow

this will bring you to the online giving portal as always thank you for being a generous giver and for helping us build the kingdom of God the scriptures describe money as God's primary rival for our devotion if that's true if the worship of money is one of the gravest dangers of the spiritual life then it's imperative to know more than a few Bible verses pulled out of context it's imperative to know the full Council of scripture on the nature of money and the source of its power some say money is simply neutral a brute tool like any other some say money's a lot like a brick bricks can break Windows they can break bone but they can also build Cathedrals you cannot blame the brick for how it's used seems simple it's not like money has a will of its own right if money is like a brick what happens when we replace the word money with the word bricks you cannot serve both God and Bricks H how hard it is for those who have bricks to enter into the kingdom of God that doesn't seem right keep your life free from the love of bricks the love of bricks is a root of all evil perhaps money isn't like a brick after all because money is more than just an object money is one a store of value and two a system of exchange it's a pathway to countless things our hearts crave we can trade money for homes and cars s and vacations for power and fame luxury and esteem money can be a tool but it can also be an idol the Bible describes money as something that flies and seduces chokes and entangles US testifies against us as though it were a spirit a false god with a will of its own to fool and enslave us Jesus calls money unrighteous the Psalms and Proverbs contrast trusting in God with trusting in wealth they warn against unrighteous means of acquiring and using wealth and against gaining so much wealth that we become arrogant and satisfied and forget our need for God the Bible even tells us that the desire for wealth is a snare that leads us into harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction in the hands of The Godly and wise money can be a tool of extraordinary good whether you have a fortune or two pennies you can convert what Jesus calls unrighteous Mamon and consecrate it for Kingdom Service transforming Earthly assets into Heavenly Treasures you can use it to serve others in amazing ways but money can also use you as it deceives and distorts seduces and enslaves so ask yourself is money your master or is it your servant is money an idol in your heart or a tool in your hand hands for the construction of the kingdom of God good good all right good morning everybody morning hey this is our third and final uh sermon in our broke series and uh we'll notice up on the screen that Pastor Jesse's account is making progress right he's he's now out of credit card debt he's got $1,000 in his emergency fund and a little bit and like and checking so he's making progress good job good job Pastor Jesse that's not true at all but that's great that's great I don't know if you've ever made a dumb financial decision I heard first service made a lot of them they said so U we I'm sure you've made a dumb financial decision or some financial decisions that you regretted um I did something stupid recently financially not the first time ever I've done something stupid financially I the the intent was good behind it I uh you know Valentine's Day was coming up and I I was doing something special and I ordered some uh tickets to go see a a show in Boston and uh with with Jen it was just you know beautiful all that kind of stuff right but you know tickets are expensive if you didn't know that and um so I bought him and so Jen says hey uh which theater is it at and I said I don't know and so I pulled up the tickets on my app and I said well it's at this theater I don't I don't remember that theater then I looked New York City not Boston I bought tickets for Broadway in in New York City didn't have enough time right it was just not going to happen I'm like you got to be kidding and then I went to how much money I did literally just preached a sermon on money and I just wasted a whole bunch of money so I'm like how can I sell these really fast it turns out there was a way for me to sell them and so instead of losing money I made 40 bucks how about [Music] that didn't get to go didn't get to go to the show uh so I'm still so anyhow anyhow that was just stupid thing but I couldn't believe it I I cannot believe that I bought tickets for New York City um so people have a way of uh lying to themselves uh we lie to ourselves a lot and people have a way of believing their own lies in fact one of the reasons that people say their lies out loud is so that they can convince themselves that it's true okay the things like I can stop whenever I want common lie I will uh I will get to it when I'm older you're older um when when things settle down when I when I catch a breath when I get a break it's never settling down and you're not getting a break it's just for a season just for 40 years later that's a long season we believe these Li we tell ourselves Li then we believe these lies one of the major things that people lie to themselves about is money Proverbs 11 our theme verse for this series is when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of Joy through blessing of the upright a city is exalted but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed we've been talking about four choices to live a financially blessed life so far we've talked about choosing hustle over hoping that's basically just work hard choosing a plan over passion that's like getting on a budget choosing discipline over debt that's getting quieter by the second she discipline over debt radically and this is the action step was cut expenses pay down debt increase savings start to invest right those are those are the the principles there and I'm hoping that after the last couple of weeks I'm hoping you didn't just like argue with me during the week like I'm hoping like during the week you like we like Pastor Kur just doesn't understand my situ ation he has no idea what this but my real situ I know some of you thought that I never going into that Financial class I ain't never going to go to a cohort I can figure this out on my own whatever it happens to be whatever your street hustle logic is right so you know you're you're you're wrestling with it that's fine but I do hope that some of you actually attempted to do some of these things for example last week one simple Act of homework was go home and cancel one subscription amen just real simple just go cancel one subscription to something and so I'm thinking I'm pretty good at this I'm pretty good at at this stuff I I got this I don't have wasteful subscriptions in my life that would be not being a good Steward and so I'm like I I got this but just in case I should check out and see if I can actually find one more subscription to cancel so I went home and I clicked on Google Play Store my phone and I found that I had force of subscriptions and I was only using one of them I'm like you got to be kidding I cannot believe it I got three subscriptions that I am piding for so I canceled all three of them right there on a spot took just two seconds then I went to my Apple account and I said there's no way I have unused subscriptions in my Apple account turns out I had three straggler subscriptions that I'd forgotten about and now those things are dead to me I canceled them so that's six that's six so far I thought I might be lucky to find one I about six and then yesterday morning just like it was like a pride check from from Jesus I was reviewing our credit card statement and found a $19.99 charge from something that neither my wife or I have purchased anything from in years 19 like Jen did you buy something I didn't buy something did you buy something like you know what what what is going on here it turns out watch this it was a special VIP stat St that was renewed automatically for our convenience it is it is now canceled and dead to us as well so what does that mean that means I thought I had no subscriptions to cancel and I had seven so maybe you might have one okay just just maybe maybe you've never had one and that's fine so I calculated up it's just about $1,000 in savings for the next year right that adds up if you don't want 1,000 bucks savings that's up to you but I wanted it here's a few Financial things that you need to pay attention to and what the drivers are behind it right now in America 43% of students that that graduate from college or have college debt are not making their payments 43% unrelated to the pandemic 43% are not paying their payments 44.7 million Americans uh have student loans totaling $1.56 trillion that's more M like that's more more than the credit card debt so like a little over a trillion dollars in credit card debt 1.5 trillion in student loans we also have $1.3 trillion in auto loans right now right now right this very minute there are more cars uh in foreclosure or being repossessed right now than any time in history like people can't pay their for their vehicles and here's a scary one if those other things didn't scare you this other here let me scare you right now 66% of all Millennials have Z in retirement savings you're like well they're young friends the Millennials aren't young anymore they're in their 30s and 40s some of you were like I'm a millennial and he just called me old I did I did like you're getting up there okay gen Z right you know the Gen gen z's are doing better this has all kinds of problematic implications unless America just decides to immediately start doing the right thing financially which is a long shot but it's not a long shot for you because we're talking about this so why is this important spiritually because in our journey with Jesus we need to use wisdom in every area of our life including our including Financial wisdom like we need to follow the wisdom of scripture in our financial life so this is not a separate part of our life this is part of our spiritual journey so whether it be hustle over hoping plan over passion discipline over bet over debt all are basic levels these are all basic levels of being wise with money now the next choice is just as important because it really gets to the heart of the matter this next Point really captures what is going on inside of you it may seem counterintuitive to some but it is in fact an essential ingredient in living a financially blessed life and that is the fourth choice which is choose choose generosity over greed tell your neighbor choose generosity over greed choose generosity over greed this is this idea of generosity is about the correct posture of one's heart and the condition of one's heart we're supposed to watch our heart we're supposed to guard our heart you know guard your heart is a is a refrain that the parents say to their children or particularly to their daughters like honey guard your heart now the real Point here is you're not just supposed to guard your heart from like weird boys but you're supposed to uh guard your heart from like the strategies of Satan to disrupt the condition of your heart amen so I say all the time we live in a war zone act like it you got to be ready you got to guard your heart this comes from a proverb Proverbs chapter 4 says guard your heart above all else for it determines the course of your life so your heart matters but in proverbs 4 there's a setup before it gets to this and it says it tells us to get wisdom it tells us to develop good judgment it tells us not to turn our back on the wisdom that we got and to guard that wisdom what's happening here and then it drops into verse 23 where it says guard your heart the idea here is that wisdom and your heart there's a connection we're supposed to get wisdom into our heart we're supposed to keep it there we're supposed to guard it we're supposed to be really careful with it so the heart and wisdom are important hold that right there Psalm 51 verse 10 King David says created me a clean heart oh God renew a loyal Spirit within me this is at towards the it's part of a song it's part of a prayer that King David prays and it's one of the most important passages in the Bible that captures the critical importance of the posture of one's heart King David if you don't know had horrifically harmed other people people that were entrusted to him and uh that he was supposed to take care of and he did not he harmed him instead he had not guarded his heart well and his heart had chosen wickedness or evil over good and when he was confronted about his wickedness he responded in a manner that we should all pay attention to he responded correctly Psalm 511 it's before the verse I read before have mercy on me oh God God because of your unfailing love because of your great compassion blot out the stain of my sins wash me clean from my guilt Purify Me from my sin for I recognize my Rebellion it haunts me day and night am I want you to identify there the extreme ownership that David is taking he did not make a mistake he did not misstep he did not make an oops or a boo boo he sinned and rebelled and was evil against God and he's owning it against you and you alone have I sinned I have done what is evil in your sight you will be proved right in what you say and your judgment against me is just for I was born a sinner yet from the moment my mother conceived me but but you desire honesty from the womb teaching me wisdom even there Purify Me from my sins and I will be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow oh give me back my joy again you have have broken me now let me Rejoice don't keep looking at my sins remove the stain of my guilt and here it is create in me a clean heart oh God renew a loyal Spirit within me so here we have the heart being very important he's repenting he's turning from his sin he's accepting his responsibility and asking God to create in him a clean heart it's a great example and if you ever wanted to know how to repent Psalm 51 right there for you there is a broad theme in the scripture highlighting the importance of our heart I'm not even though I keep pointing to my physical heart I'm not talking about our physical heart today we talking about our emotional and our spiritual heart and inside of this idea of the heart the major theme around the importance of it is a connection that would surprise many people from the outside many people that are unfamiliar with faith many people that are unfamiliar with Jesus they may be surprised at what Jesus is about to say again heart matters a pure heart matters wisdom and the Heart matter and Jesus starts to talk about this and and he does it when he's teaching about money and finances and he drops this nugget in the middle of this teaching on finances where he connects our financial choices with the condition of our heart it might be surprising but he does Matthew 69 he says don't store up Treasures here on Earth where moths eat and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal store your Treasures in Heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal wherever your treasure is there the desires of your heart will also be Hallelujah so he makes this connection between your treasure your finances your money and your heart we've said it before but you direct your life with the choices you make or don't make around your calendar in your checkbook if you want to see what you really value or find out what's important do a calendar analysis like where do you spend your time and do a checkbook analysis or where do you spend your money and that's going to give you an accurate report of how your heart is actually doing and I want to say this today do not be afraid of the truth whatever it is it is you can't lie your way out of it just just let the truth be the truth because the truth is the beginning of Freedom you can't be free unless you know the truth why do you think we have stretchy jeans because we don't want to know the truth right right I mean I got the stretchy Jean I've said before it's like wearing jeggings all the time now the uh the uh why you got that c why do you have that scale in the closet because you don't want to know the truth but you can't find Freedom unless you know the truth there's this thing called Tik Tock for those of you that don't know Tik Tock is like like a social media app where you can watch people do videos it's like short form videos that they're not like super long they're usually pretty short and people dance and people say stupid things and but one of the things that they have on there is financial influencers and so there's people giving Financial advice much which is stupid uh but they give Financial advice well this one Financial influencer she got really big really famous uh and was giving reasonable Financial advice at first and then she wrote a book and best-selling book and she gives pretty normal Financial modern Financial advice basically you can write a book on finances and say the same exact thing that everybody else says and just repackage it and it'll sell so she talks about budgeting and saving and investing all the basic things but then she took a Twist and she does something that I had not heard somebody ever and and I've read a lot of these things somebody I I've not heard someone be so blatantly obvious about she took a pretty dark turn and she di dismisses certain things that are of high value things like loyalty it's like she dismisses loyalty as a virtue she blatantly Advocates greed and self- advancement over purpose and fulfillment like wow it's pretty OB I'm like well I respect the honesty like I respect that you know she just being bold about it because it became as I read uh the book finished it it became apparent that for her the goal the goal of money is to have the most that's her goal that that's that's the end of life the meaning the big meaning is to have the most not a single bit of advice in the entire book about generosity not a single bit of advice about caring for others nothing nothing it's just straight up blatant uh um uh unabashedly uh and unapologetically let's just go get the most for me spiritually what's occurred in this moment is that the money has become the goal instead of the tool this is called greed it's literally pure greed in black and white getting more is the end goal they think or she thinks so the question has to be asked us today well if we're talking about being wise with money and increase and abundance and blessing that that's all great but what is it for what is the more for like why why should we even think about having more what's it for but unless you know the answer to this question well it's going to be a problematic IC for this lady I'm talking about answering the question what is the more for she would have to honestly answer the more is for the purpose of getting more and that's that's honestly not good enough and scripturally it's not good enough so even a financially informed person making financially solid decisions can find themselves ending up back in financial slavery watch this we're warned really carefully not to go going into debt because when we're in debt uh um we can become Financial slaves and so you can actually start as a financial slave to debt get out of debt become prosperous and then end up as a financial slave to Greed Mammon gets you on both sides debt and greed so we have to be careful so you've got to know what the more is for Luke chapter 12 Jesus is uh telling a story and it connects here financially beware guard against every kind of greed life is not measured by how much you own then he told him a story a rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops he said to himself what should I do I don't have room for all my crops then he said I know I'll tear down my Barns and build bigger ones then I'll have enough room to store all my wheat and other goods and I'll sit back and say to myself my friend you have enough stored away for years to come now take it e e eat drink and be marry but God said to him hold on eat drink and be Mary Jesus is uh saying this is a bad thing to say like he's not saying woohoo Live It Up YOLO right that's not what he's doing he's saying this is the wrong thing to say isn't interesting that as a culture e drink to be merry is a positive thing but Jesus said missing the point but God said to him you fool you will die this very night then who will get everything you worked for yes a person is a fool to store up Earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God this is J is what is the more for and if you don't have that answer down you end up being a financial slave to Greed after you got out of debt we do not build bigger barns to Simply build bigger barns you build a barn for a purpose and if you build a bigger Barn it better be for a bigger purpose nothing inside of this now don't get this messed up nothing inside of what we're saying says that you are not allowed to have nice things Jesus is not against you having nice things Jesus is against nice things having you again Financial slavery on the debt side or on the greed side we're avoiding all of that Proverbs 11 verse 2 3 says The Godly can look forward to a reward while the wicked can expect only judgment give freely and become more wealthy be stingy and lose everything the generous will prosper those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed people curse those who hoard their grain but bless the one who sells in time of need there's a lot of heavy verses that we're reading today I'm going to ask Chris Martina to come on up to the stage come on up here Chris come on up CH all right I did end the verse there with like a wicked I wasn't calling you Wicked um at all here so uh Chris why don't you introduce yourself good morning I'm Chris uh my family and I have been coming to ecic for a number of years and right now one of the things that God's doing and uh in my life is having me lead an opportunity here uh around Financial Freedom uh in our church and uh it's about setting captives free yep so last time Chris was up here we were talking about emergency funds and how like one of the critical factors in getting yourself out of debt is to establish a $1,000 emergency fund it's like one of the hardest steps for people to do and so uh we've talked about that over the last couple of weeks so let's talk about generosity for a minute um what do you think about all this generosity stuff it's awesome I think generosity for me um um is really a a challenge but it's one of those things where uh it really starts to to get it my heart um like we were talking about and really starts to talk about the condition of my heart and so you have that situation where you have like the the heart monitor that's going beep beep beep I don't know if you ever seen that on TV uh but you know we're talking about how time how we spend our time how we spend our money what we give our attention to those are sort of the those indicators of how our hearts beeping um and so generosity is one of those things that really helps me uh with that and um in terms of generosity specifically generosity uh is about more about God than it is about me and so if we're created in God's image", " well that means we serve a generous God and we can be generous because God is generous to us if that makes sense a little bit complicated but I don't know if that makes sense and so that goes not only to provide all of my needs whether it's financially or with time or things like that but also my need for life in the person of Jesus Christ and his sacrifice for me on the cross and so that's ultimate generosity right there right so the people that I know that have been Christians or been following Jesus for a long time that have made generosity and stewardship a really important part of of their life uh they end up saying this exact same thing that you just said like it's something about this act of generosity and building it into your life and becoming a generous person and and financially specifically what we're talking about now ends up helping us understand God better it's a fascinating fascinating thing in fact uh in the Scripture it talks about tithing or or 10% of our uh income our increase that we're giving uh back um one of the things that the scripture talks about is that tithing is about trust like the point isn't really about the money it's about trust it's about whether we trust God or not and trust is not the most common commodity that we have in our life right we're not like loaded with trust to give out so it's hard so it's sry so we understand that it's difficult so why is why is generosity important to you personally you know to me person personally I think it definitely has to do with that trust piece because I think there's a lie that I've wrestled through uh a little bit and maybe you can relate but that lie is really well is God really trustworthy you know is it can I really trust him and I've wrestled with that because it's one of those things where sometimes it's hard to be generous it's hard to be like I'm gonna I'm gonna let go right and I can be generous like I said earlier because he is generous um and I think the you know working around that lie is one thing that's really important um and I think like you were talking about the you know what's the why about right and that generosity isn't just being unspecific about the generosity it's being very specific and very intentional about the generosity because it's about doing the work that God has for us to do it's about advancing the kingdom um and using generosity to do that sure sure so on a spectrum uh in your life you've kind of been financially in different places in your life um and does that impact generosity how what what's that all about absolutely um so you know many of you don't know my full story but um definitely have been uh in an environment of scarcity and been in Surplus and been back and forth maybe you've been in some of those places yourself uh but for me it's something where um it causes me to continually rely on God and continually be in a position where it's not about me it's not about what the the uh the advertisement says you know I deserve it I deserve that giant cupcake thing uh that I can order from TV or I deserve that new car uh because it's year-end financing or or whatever the deal is I don't deserve it um the reality is is that um I'm relying on God and that's that's that's it and so from there it allows me to surrender that to God um and it allows me to be faithful regardless of my bank account whether it's negative or whether it's positive um yeah I think people are making fun of you when you said the word scarcity yeah scarcity so broke you've been broke you've been broke and not broke okay broke sorry my bad so it's obviously easier when you're not broke to be more generous right you know that that's the hard part right I think it's the same um because it's really about do we trust God it's really about where is our heart at um and sometimes um when you're not broke the numbers get bigger so it gets even harder um and if we're not not being faithful in the small things it's going to be harder to be faithful in the in the bigger things right there's a common misconception that when you get to a place of more financial sustainability and surplus that it's just easier to give more and it's actually not true um it's not true and because it's not about the amount it's about your heart and it it so whether you got two pennies or $2 million generosity is still the same issue with your heart right um tell us about the class that's coming up yeah I'm really excited about this um so we have a Financial Freedom class that's going to be starting on Wednesday night so uh you all are invited to join and uh there's a QR code in the back uh if you want to sign up you can sign up in the church Center app it's my invisible phone in case you didn't see it um and so uh basically it's a it's a four-week class uh where we talk about financial literacy then there's the fifth week where we introduce uh something that we've started recently here at the church called budget cohorts this is where it becomes really practical and really specific to uh participants it's a much smaller group we get into uh learning techniques on how to actually create that emergency fund and how to reduce debt um step by step and those cohorts meet uh on a monthly basis after that so five weeks uh and then you can roll right into a cohort if you choose um starting this Wednesday so I don't know everybody that's in a cohort nor I do I know who this person is but somebody I heard this week in the cohort uh paid made their final payment on their student loans yeah yeah they absolutely it was a huge victory paid off one of their student loans and uh you know we have this uh thread again my invisible phone on Church Center we have a thread going and I saw that message come through and I was like yes praise God you know uh just sort of a victory uh for the cohort so yeah great thank you Chris awesome so action step what do you do with all this how do you choose generosity over greed well you follow God's generosity plan and it's just I I would just summarize it like this there's three pretty simple ways first off start with simple obedience start with obedience second Branch out into creative generosity and third uh make a plan to leave a legacy so you're investing into the future not just for now Generations ahead and so simple obedience this is like the basic 101 with generosity in scripture is called tithing the second part the creative generosity this is just blessing other people in the ways that God has placed upon your heart you're being creative with it and you're kind of really intentionally doing this and leaving a legacy contributing to something that will Outlast you and that's uh those are some things to do there's an interesting teaching uh that the Apostle Paul gives about money and he specifically gives this teaching in a context of receiving an offering about about giving that's what he does I'm going to ask the worship team to come up in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 he says this remember this a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop but the one who plants generously will get a generous crop you must each decide in your heart there's the heart issue how much to give and don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure for God loves a person who gives cheerfully and God will generously provide all you need then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others as the scripture says they share freely and give generously to the poor their good deeds will be remembered forever for God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat in the same way he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you yes you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous and when we take your gifts to those who need them they will thank God so gives us fairly significant teaching on on giving this is why all this conversation choosing generosity over greed this is why the city rejoices when the righteous Prosper because when the righteous Prosper widows are provided for and orphans find families and the broken and the captives and the oppressed can experience healing freedom justice and good news when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of Joy through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted that by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed would you stand with me as we close [Music] today before the worship team leads us let me just make sure you understand that there is an assumption inside of all of this and here's the Assumption as I go into messages like this [Music] I've said this before many times actually uh East Coast International Church uh and Pastor Kurt in a very very direct kind of way I don't need you to give you need you to give Hallelujah this isn't about like Financial survival for the church or something this is about spirit spiritual thriving this is about unlocking Financial blessing in your life and and being wise with money in all the areas I just want to make sure you understand that second is I believe that all true followers of Jesus want to do this want to choose generosity over greed something within you resonates and you're like yes I want to be as generous as possible and even impossible I want to be so generous and not greedy that's who I want to be but in order to do so we've got to follow God's plans we got to follow God's generosity plan that but none of this takes place in a vacuum all of this takes place in a really complicated moment in our history where it's a very broken economic system and things are complicated and housing is too much money and this is too much money and this is too much money and wages aren't keeping out it's just complicated and so we've got to be really really good at the steps like hustle over hoping and plan over passion and discipline over debt right these things all could help get you there this isn't in a vacuum it's in the context of something much bigger and much more difficult to do and so as we've encouraged you invite God into your financial life invite God into this process surrender when you're surrendering your life to God this is even part of it for many of us it is a critical part part of it because it is this thing that fights you the most Against full surrender to God so as the worship team leads us in this Tak some time to pray today the altars are open if you [Music] like who else would rocks cry out to worship whose Glory taught the Stars to [Music] shine perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing but this Joy is mine sing in church with a thousand Hallelujah we magnify your name you alone deserve the glory the

watching online I'd like to welcome my family who came and supported me today they say always do thank you I appreciate it Let the Church Say Amen Let the church say Amen again all right we are awake ready to go the first thing I like to do is just uh say I I preach once a year as he said and I absolutely love my favorite part is when I come up here and I see new faces that means that the church is growing it means that God's not through yet God's still in the business of saving people amen so that's just a great thing I love it what I like to do is I'm on a journey I think we're all on a journey and the last time I preached God laid a message on my heart I just want to go back because it ties into where we're going today the first thing I want to talk about is Jesus right before he went to heaven he prayed for us and he prayed his first part of his prayer was to sprain to get the father my prayer is that you not take them out of the world the first thing he says please don't take him out of the world and I don't know about you as a Christian I'm like when I accept to Christ wouldn't it be just easy if we just get swooped up to heaven and that's the end of that we'll be forever with Jesus right or there's times in my life when I look around what's going on in our world today and I said oh Lord when you just come and get us now it would be a good time for you to come but then I experienced things like I did on Wednesday night when we get together as a church before Thanksgiving we get to hear some stories of what God is doing in people's life and that really excites me and then I'm reminded why he didn't take us out of the world because he's not done yet and we're not done yet amen God has been for all of us to do amen but this is what he did pray he said father protect them from the evil one he asked the father to protect us from the evil one and I think about when I read this scripture verse all the things Jesus could have prayed for us right before he went to heaven before he died sorry all the things could have prayed for us to be wealthy could have prayed for us to have nice houses a lot of land wisdom God could have prayed for Jesus could pray for anything but I'm fascinated by what he prayed this is what Jesus said he said I've given them the glory that you gave me that they may be one as we are one in them and you and me I in them and you and me so that they may be brought to complete Unity so that the world would know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me Jesus prayed for all of us for Unity and unity as a church of all the things because it's through our Unity our differences but we come together think about that doesn't matter who we vote for it doesn't matter all of that culturally we come together from all different backgrounds but when we come together on a Sunday morning to me this is what church this is what the Heaven's going to look like we come together in unity Unity for what in Jesus and celebrating who Jesus is amen and that Unity I don't know about you but since I preached the last time I seemingly think our country's just continuing to go like this just take a look the last this last month we had an election you could just see our country just continue to go in this direction and what a tremendous testimony would be for all of us if we had the ability to go out there into the world and show them the unity that we have the unity that we have because we love everybody we love God and we love people think about that we have a tremendous opportunity Church God's raising us up for a Time such as this in this time to go out to our world and to our city and let them know that we don't care where you come from we don't care who you vote for we just care about you having a relationship with Jesus that's really what's important and so then after that the great thing about preaching once a year is when I get done I get to ask God okay God what's next and I am I'm not gonna lie to you sometimes it takes God a little bit of time to get my attention so I'm glad I have a lot of time to think about it and they just this one was interesting right after I said Okay God what's next and I always just wait and listen and God took me to the scripture verse Peter Peter was had denied Jesus three times the Bible tells us that he wept bitterly when he went out and did that and then Jesus when he came back he had a meal with the disciples and then he called Peter aside and he said Peter do you love me Peter said yes Lord I love you he said feed my Lambs the next thing he said again Jesus Jesus said Peter do you love me he said yes Lord you know I love you he said take care of my sheep and the third thing he said he asked them again Peter do you love me if Peter got upset by this he said Lord you know all things you know that I love you and he said take care of my sheep how many you know that Jesus is the Good Shepherd and that we are his sheep if you're here today and you're and we are here today as Christians we're part of the family we're all sheep you could either say Amen or some of you can buy if you want to we can do that right now but if you're here today what part of God's family he's talking about us and I think about that Jesus said in Luke chapter 19 10 for the son of man he's talking about himself he came to seek and save that which is lost and when I read that scripture verse I say wow Peter you got a lot of responsibility you got a lot of work to do you got to feed a sheep take care of a sheep now the end of the of the sermon that would be a pretty bad sermon but that's not he also said this in the Bible he said when he came to them to worship them Jesus said all authority in Heaven and Earth is given to me therefore go and make disciples of all Nations and baptize them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Spirit and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you to do and surely I Am With You Always to the end of age see that wasn't just for Peter it's for all of us Jesus told us all to go and Make Disciples of all Nations and as I see this the scripture as I get ready to preach my heart was broken by our country it seemingly like you've turned on the radio churches are closing at a rapid pace people are no longer going to church people have fallen away and that really breaks my heart I can't imagine what it does to God's heart but then I reminded that Jesus said that he came to seek and save that which is lost so the scripture I'd like to talk about today is what does it mean to be lost and how does Jesus want us to reach out to the people that are lost there's three different type of lost people Jesus talked about the first one is found it's a parable of the lost sheep and this is what Jesus said he said then Jesus told him this Parable suppose if one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it and when he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home and then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says Rejoice with me I have found my lost sheep and I tell you the same way that there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sin than that repents than over 99 righteous people who do not need to repent and I think about that the fascinating thing I have to understand is about the Bible is it was written 2000 years ago back then when Jesus was talking to the people that gathered around him but army they were they were either Shepherds they were farmers and they were fishermen and so when he talked about a shepherd He had that he a sheep he had that Shepherd's attention and just like when he talked about farming he had the farmer's attention because that's what they knew and so obviously I don't know about you but the truths of God goes through the truth in the parable the same yesterday today and forever for all of us but I grew up in Lynn my whole life I don't know about you guys but I grew up in Lynn most of my life I have seen deer Inland I have seen the turkeys and Lynn I have even seen a raccoon run across the road in Lynn Massachusetts but to be honest with you I have never seen a sheep walk up Western Avenue in Massachusetts I ain't never seen that so sometimes when I read the Bible I have to ask myself really what is it like to be a sheep that wanders off and I am very thankful and blessed that I have a wonderful wife and she's from Montana and when I go to Montana my father-in-law he's a farmer when I get out there with him he I absolutely love the Bible comes alive to me he takes me out in the field he shows me the different types of soil he shows me the wheat and what happens when the when the tear or the weeds get involved with it and how that is is a conflict I understand the Bible more and there was one time four years ago I went out with my wife and there's not a lot to do in Montana I ain't gonna lie to you so we go just visiting everybody and if my if my mother-in-law's listening I love to visit in Montana we just visit everybody and I remember one day I woke up and said okay honey what are we doing today she said oh we're going to go visit Juanita and I said what's a Juanita she said Juanita she is the she is the Sheep lady or the goat lady and I said oh this is going to be fun so we went over to a house and on the way to telling me how much she loves these sheep and she loves the goats and that's all she has and I said oh that's cool my kids are with me we're having fun we walk into a house I'm dead serious I walk into a house and there comes a goat walking by in the living room and I was like now this is something you don't see every day I kind of like this we went downstairs in the basement and when we got down to the basement she had a little sheeps in there and a little goat she was taking care of them because they weren't ready to go out with the rest she was nursing it was fascinating to me I've never seen nothing like that in my life but then I said to uh my kids I said hey let's go outside she only want to go see the ghosts sheep go outside I said I love to now listen one thing I do know about sheep the Bible says that Jesus is a Shepherd we're the Sheep but he also we have to understand that Chief's not a smart animal I remember when I first learned that I said that's just disrespect I don't like the fact that I'm not I'm not a smart man I'm a smart man well listen the funny thing about sheep is this do you realize that if the shepherd was right here and here's all the water and we were out there grazing that we would die of thirst because of sheep has no sense of direction they just wander around they listen to the voice of the shepherd they know the voice of the shepherd and I remember going outside with my kids and I said hey I was telling them the story and I said hey let me tell you about this I'm gonna show you what it's like to be a chef but come follow me we went out there seriously we went out there in front of all the sheep in the goat and I went out there and I said hey sheep the water's over here come on let's get some water and I walk and nothing happened the Sheep just sat there just eating it not nothing happened I was like this is disrespectful my kids are here so I was like all right I said I'm from Lynn I don't give up so I went over I stepped a little bit to the side and I said run there's a wolf coming and I try to run real fast and they just kids are rolling at me now that's like oh they didn't do nothing but I'll tell you this when it came out a little while later she said what are you guys doing I said I'm trying to get this sheep they don't want to listen to nobody she said oh I'm about to take them down to the barn right now come with me and she walked out there and she called them sheep and let me tell you something every single one of them just turned and followed her to that barn and then she did have a little sheepdog out there barking at all the other ones that want to take that slow time to get up there but my point of the matter is it came to life to me the Sheep knew the shepherd's voice they weren't listening to anybody else no matter what I did they weren't going to listen and then the Bible tells me here in Luke chapter 15 verse 5 that when the shepherd finds that lost sheep he puts it on his shoulder and takes him home joyfully puts it on his shoulder and I asked myself this is a Christian listen I'll be honest with you I don't watch the TV and I don't watch the news because it's heartbreaking sometimes to watch when they put Christians on there how they act towards other people sometimes we forget there's another part of this story where he said it joyfully took him and put him on his shoulders and brought him home didn't yell at the Sheep didn't beat the Sheep didn't kick the Sheep didn't shame the Sheep listen he picked them up joyfully took him and carried him home because a sheep just wanders off stops eating a little bit of grass here and a little bit of grass then next thing you know he's in the neighbor shot somewhere down the road and the shepherd realizes that that's fascinating he's counting them all he got to 99 he wasn't happy that he lost one he went and found them and that's the same way the first category of people that we run across are people who just wander off people who know the shepherd they went to church they know the community they just happened to wander off we see this a lot when covert hit when Kobe hit we were forced to do things we never had to do watch online and people some people just got comfortable doing that their life changed their situation changed some people it's a new job some people they can they have children and I can't tell you how many times I have someone come up to me and say John I met the one and I said what do you mean you met the one they meet a new boyfriend a girlfriend the next thing you know the life's all upside down and six months later they're back here the same situation sometimes but my point is even in a good situation of finding that right one that could be a distraction and we could wander away so we have to understand that the first one is that wanders off is a sheep who just wanders off the next thing that we have to understand is when we talk about the loss is the Lost coin Jesus then talks about this in the parable he says suppose a woman has 10 silver coins and loses one doesn't she light a lamp and sweep it in the house sweep the house and carefully look for it until she finds it and when she finds it she calls her friends and neighbors together and says Rejoice with me I have found my lost coin in the same way I tell you there's more rejoicing in the presence of angels of God over one sinner who repents and I think about this right here the coin was lost by someone else's neglect the coin did nothing wrong the coin was lost because someone else was neglectful and it can't help you see this so many times people raised up in different religions you see people in different countries you're not even allowed to share the gospel or have a Bible in those countries those people who grow up they're they're lost because someone else neglected them someone else forgot to tell them who the word what the word of God was but I like what it says here in Luke chapter 15 8 it says doesn't she light a lamp she's looking she likes to laugh and looks for the coin what does that have to do with us today you see that that light is the power of the holy spirit for us today the Bible says here in Matthew chapter 5 verse 14 to 16 he's Jesus talking you are the light of the world a town built on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on a stand and it gives lights to everyone in the house and then he says in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good dudes yeah I'm sorry man I don't know what's up all right Deeds y'all with me you follow me all right amen and glorify your father in Heaven dudes and deeds he was talking of all of them but the truth of the matter is we have to let our light shine bright into the light of people someone and it's different the person that wanders off you speak to him different or she differently because they know who God is they just wandered off in this situation we have to understand our audience could you imagine if someone who never heard a God and never heard of Jesus in their entire life and I go into the break room with them and I say hey how you doing my name is John Henkel I go to East Coast International Church and I just want you to know that I'm Justified Sanctified glorified one of these days I'm going to say bye-bye amen if I went in there that might be true but if I would I just don't think that's the right approach for someone who never understood who God was right they may say I don't even want you to sit at my table never mind go to your church amen but we have to understand okay so what does that mean when we let our light shine think about that we talked about earlier listen our Unity being at unity in one Accord if we genuinely love God and love other people it's going to be the light that shines out what do you mean you're sitting at my table what do you mean there's so many other people here you really want to hear what's going on in my life yeah I do it's through that light that we shine through light bright to someone who's never heard of God is going to make them hopefully someday turn around say I don't know what he wants but I want some of that and that's how we reach someone who is lost by someone else's neglect you see the thing that's interesting is if Jesus came right now and he was walking down here in front and he came here people from watching online people from Revere and us we would be truly blessed but the question I have for you is what about the rest of Lynn Massachusetts Massachusetts the United States and the world they would miss out on that because Jesus was here and only online with people watching that's why I find it fascinating that Jesus said this he said greater things you'll do to this greater things you'll do than I will because he's going to the father and when he went to the father he gave us a promise the Holy Spirit think about that all of us here today the different jobs we work the schools that we work at all the things that we do differently man I'll tell you what we can go out and let that light shine and we can reach so many more people for Jesus amen that's why it's important that we understand that God has us for us to do is to reach those to reach people for him but I also understand we never can be complacent so many churches Across America are closing because they got complacent they got 30 40 people sitting in it man this is great hey they'll have dinner at your house next week and they just got complacent the best way I can describe this is this I'm a youth leader I love the youth if you have a youth Say Amen ah we love the youth but I just love my friend Stephanie over there could you imagine my friend Stephanie that I went on a youth convention I had 10 kids with me we won a youth convention man we had a lot of fun singing was great people were just praising the Lord and I love to see our young people praising the Lord it just does something to me to know the next generation is serving and praising God but could you imagine I show up here at East Coast National Church right here on the side and I said hey Stephanie how you doing you looking good definitely it's been a while since I talked to you listen the youth convention was absolutely great we had a great time but I just want to let you know it was time to go and I couldn't find Jada couldn't find her dude he wasn't around look for it but say it's time to go so I went home and then I said to her but listen I have nine of the ten people that I came with that's a 90 that's an a I don't remember ever getting a when I was in high school so hey that's doing good that might be good today but get I don't think Stephanie's gonna appreciate that a right amen but that's the same way we have to be passionate if this church ever what and listen I'm excited about the people we the first service and second service people are coming back I am so thankful for that but guess what there's more season if we need to let's knock some walls down and build another church or whatever we need to do we don't want to ever be content or complacent until everyone has the opportunity to to receive the word of God Amen and the thing I want you to understand is you are treasured every one of us here is treasured by God and the last thing that we have the last one is The Prodigal Son and this was very difficult for me to to write for because I think about this as all the times I've read this in my life at some time this year um I heard someone teaching on this and they said that there was a man who had two sons he said the youngest son said to the father father give me my share of the estate give it to me and so the father divided his property but I never understood when someone said how painful and disrespectful that it was to the father that son was basically telling that father listen I don't have time to wait for you to die so why don't you just give me the money now so I can go and I think about what it must have been like for that father to hear those words from his son and then I think about 2 000 years ago but guess what I think of the modern day we live in and what it must be like for God right now to watch so many people that that are his children walk away and not going to church and just seemingly throw our hands up here and walk away and the pain that that must be causing God it just breaks my heart and not only that on Wednesday night as we said before Thanksgiving we heard a great testimony to what God was doing in the lives of people but guess what we also heard stories of how people are going through this right now with people that they care about walking away not caring anymore but the one great thing I love about the word of God is this hope there's always hope the Bible says this the boy went out to spend all this money while living did everything he had to do then he then he went out and he he was in the working with the pigs and everything but this is what the Bible says here's our hope it says when he came to his senses there had to be a point when the child came or the man woman came to their senses sometimes God has to put you on your back to make you look up and that and so that situation I don't know if you've ever gone through that if you're going through it now that could be a very difficult situation I wish I could be up here today preaching to you guys and telling you that there was a scripture verse that I found that says you can grab someone and drag them back into the kingdom of heaven but that's not what it says God wants people who love them love him not people that are robots and so but the truth of the matter is hold on don't ever give up on Hope on anybody the Bible says he came to his senses and like I said on Wednesday night yes I heard stories about situations where people have stopped and gave up but I also heard stories from people that got up here and shared their story and how they made we made the decisions like that but then they're back in serving God and being in God's house don't ever give up on that but in this situation we have someone who deliberately walked away so we have one the sheep that just wanders away busyness of life you have the second one that's the Lost coin that was lost because of someone else's neglect and the third thing is someone who's rebellious who knows who God is and just walks away and that's why I absolutely love baptism I say it every time I preach baptism in the Wednesday night program I absolutely love it I go down there and I grab a seat I just want to be real close to everybody giving their testimony because when you're down there listening to the testimony I could just sit there and I could see the people that wandered away who said they came back that God brought back and I see the people who are lost because someone else neglected them I've seen people where they've been in a boot raised in a Buddhist house with grandparents and parents and God just snatched them up out and saved them out of there I never would have thought it possible but then God uses them now to reach out to the people in their family that's the god that we serve amen and then of course we also see the people a lot of prodigal sons and daughters we hear about that in the testimonies of life that they made decisions and God took them back and that excites me it's one of the favorite things I do is a faith builder for me but I also understand I love to sit back and say listen to the story I had a friend I have someone who loved me I had someone who cared about me I had someone who was willing to put their arms around me when I was going through a difficult time that's what it means to be a Christian to those around us whether they wander away whether they're a lost coin or whether they're rebellious listen it's our responsibility to love them the way that Jesus did because it also says that the father welcomed him no lectures no I told you so not you embarrassed me in front of the whole neighborhood go live over there in the barn none of that the Bible says that Jesus I just took him back in and embraced him and loved him and that's the same way that Jesus does for all of anyone who's walked away from him we have to remember that and not treat the people who come back and say well you're back here for the 57th time listen it's about loving them the way that Jesus did amen and I know that for some of you here that's really easy some of you guys are simple they raised you up to go out there and witness the people we have a friend Dave manale say great friend of mine he was a postman and he would love to go out and he would tell everybody that he met about Jesus he would go deliver his mail and he would give the mail say hey let me tell you about Jesus invite him to church it was natural like that to him very easy to him and I would always tell people that one one time he had someone called in sick and he was in the hot Massachusetts and he went up and he met this young lady and said to her would you like to come to my church it's over here and invited her and that's my wife I'm not supposed to embarrass her so he invited her to church and I think about that my life my two daughter my daughter my son none of that would have happened if someone didn't take a step she never would have found the church I don't think on her own but someone had to take the step and I'm thankful for that somebody but I know that some of you that's not the same that's not the case and some of you have fallen to this category I'm gonna tell you a story you ready there was a rich man he was the richest man in all of the land Not only was he the richest man in all the land he had a daughter and she was the most beautiful daughter in the land and so what happened was every time he went into town all the single guys came up to him and said hey can I have your daughter's hand and married marriage and this bothered the man because he did not know did they love her for who she was did they love her because of her beauty or did they love her for his money and it bothered the man he was sad so one day he had an idea and he went into town and all the single men came up to say hey can I have your daughter's hand in marriage he said yeah you want my dog's hand marriage be at my house Saturday at 3 o'clock three o'clock he said that to all the single man yeah yeah three o'clock come to my house yep and so three o'clock came on Saturday and the whole place was full the man was the wealthiest man as I told you so he had an Olympic-sized swimming pool big old swimming pool and he said listen it's very simple you guys are going to go on that side over there and I'm gonna go on this side with my daughter and the first one of you they can jump in the water and swim to the other side will win my daughter's hand in marriage God's like yeah I used to swim I got this let's go so as the father was walking back big old dump truck came and dumped a whole bunch of poisonous water moccasins in the water because the man knew that whoever would jump into the water and swim would not do it for his money would not do it for his daughter's Beauty but would do it because they genuinely loved his daughter so he said all right guys You Ready Set Go nothing happened the man was kind of getting a little sad nothing happened so he waited a bit longer nothing now the guy's getting depressed he's saying to himself I knew this was the truth nobody even cares about my daughter just want my money or her beauty and just when he was about to give up Splash on the other side man jumped into the water he started swimming for his life he swim over the moccasins he swim under the walking mountain he swam all the way through all the way to the other side he got to the other side and that father he was so proud of that man he said congratulations you made it what do you have to say and that man said I just want to know who pushed me in on the other side you know what I'm saying and I love that story you know I know why because I'm in youth ministry and I'll tell you right now I love youth ministry but I'm not afraid to go up to somebody and say hey someone needs to serve today and Dodge them in on the other side right sometimes we just need a nudge hey man some of us just need a nudge and I shared this with the first service one time we were in youth group it was time to pray and then all of a sudden uh they went through the prayer request and my man Ethan was there prayed and I don't know about you guys but I've been youth group a long time why is it every Wednesday night when it's time to pray I always hear oh I got a test tomorrow pray for me and I said how about you open a book then we won't be need to pray about this every Wednesday night just crack a book but you know but we still pray for him but I'll never forget like I said I love the opportunity just to nudge somebody so we went around like 15 requests there was a lot of people that day and I turned at the last second and I said Ethan bring us home Ethan bring us home and Ethan was like what I said here bring us home Ethan pray for us but I'll tell you what made me so proud as a youth leader he bowed his head and he prayed and he got every single one of those prayer requests he remembered every single one of them and I think about that to the individual person going through something in your life how exciting it must be for them to know wow he cared enough about me to pray for me amen all right worship team come on up come on up worship team we're almost done maybe oh one what worship sing we're gonna do acapella listen I don't know if you noticed but I'm Johnny fresh or wjjw youth group will tell you they know if you need me to sing you know I can uh I can break it for you but anyway they're coming up here but I just like to end it um why I tie the two sermons together because it's uh it's important um it was important to me the last time I gave the unity um sermon it was when I was at my work and my work is 70 Spanish-speaking people is their primary language and this woman she didn't speak a word of English but but she was just happy every time I saw her she was happy and one day I was walking through to the time clock where she punches in and I heard her singing in Spanish a song I didn't know the song and I was like hey wait a minute I know that song and it was way maker and all of a sudden I started saying I waited to the got to the chorus and I started singing in English and she started continuing to sing in Spanish and I'll tell you what in front of them other people she said Hallelujah and she started singing and praising God and I was like well so you know what I would do I said all right every time I went to her line could be in the summertime when it's 90 degrees if you ever work in manufacturing or it could be when it's the coldest I would walk by her and I would just start singing Waymaker and she'd be working and she would just stop praising the Lord but there was another worker there he was the actual the machine operator he spoke English and Spanish he was a Christian and then one day when I was singing that song with her he started singing he was breaking it in both English and Spanish and I said to myself this is what it's going to be like to be in unity in one Accord to be in complete Unity we didn't have that we had different backgrounds we spoke different languages but guess what when we were at line one we were praising the Lord in our own language and it was a great opportunity for me to see what it's like to be in complete Unity but I say that to you because in January this year I said to myself New Year's Day hey I'm going to be 57 this year I feel really good I feel good I feel like I can work till I'm 80. yeah I did but then all of a sudden they changed my job and I went from working on the floor walking as a supervisor to sitting down at a desk and when I sat down at the desk I was like this all day and I had tremendous problems with my shoulders I was miserable painful then I come through that September I hurt my knee playing volleyball with my fellow volleyball brothers and sisters and I was even more miserable I mean I wasn't because I was getting old that's for sure I must have did something else but it bothered me even more because now my shoulder aches my knees ache my kids making fun of me because they say all I do is cry about all the time but I just remember that to make matters worse capacity well this is a good part sorry that's Kurt asked me to preach beginning November listen when he texts me do you want to preach I couldn't grab my phone and put yes fast enough I was excited about that I had a word but I remember when I did that the week the week after they came in they got rid of all the middle management of my work my boss all of them and I knew that day what that meant John's going to have to have more work to do and so now I have shoulders and knees and now I got my job to work I was miserable honey you don't need to say Amen but I was seriously I was having a tough time and I remember one day sitting at my desk and someone made a mistake and now I have to get up and walk all the way to the other building to figure out what happened and I was walking by that line one where those people my workers were and the guy says John John come here come here and I was like oh man what now you know I'm not gonna lie I said well and he says I got a word for you you got a word for me he said yeah I noticed that you won't come visit too much I was at the desk job you don't come visit us anymore we don't sing anymore yeah I'm sorry about that you're right he says I also noticed that you've been walking around with your head down a lot he says and that bothering me he says I have a word for you and then he goes to tell me a scripture verse said it started with a J and I was like Joshua no Jeremiah no James no judges I said judges he said judges yeah judges judges judges 6 24. and I'll never forget for those of you that have known me for a long time will know that my favorite person in the Bible is a man named Gideon love them love Gideon so much I named my son after him Jeremiah Gideon and I remember I've read that so many times but when I opened up the Bible right in front of him I read this Judges chapter 6 24. it says so Gideon built an altar to the lord and there he called the Lord his peace and he said to me I want you to know that's the word that God wants me to give to you today don't worry about what's going on with your life the Lord is peace and I just remember getting filled up that my whole body I just got filled up I can't explain it to you the overwhelming love of God that I felt because someone took a chance to come up and tell me and as we close today I think about this how many people right now in our country that we can go and we can speak to whether they've wandered off whether they never heard about who Jesus was or in a state where they're just going out and doing their own thing how many of them need to know that the Lord is peace and so the challenge I have for all of us today is that we will go out and we will share as a community in unity will go out to those people around us that have wandered off that don't know who God is and be patient and love those people who have walked away God's not done yet amen so with that let's stand and Worship the Lord I would invite you that if you're going through a difficult time or even if you're not we just want to let you know I'm thankful that there's people here that God has rescued from wandering away rescued from being lost because someone else's neglect and also for those that have wandered away that have come back just pray for those that are not the god you'll touch your lives amen so the office are open I the invitation to come", "\n\n**Meeting Note**\n\n

great week we had here um the just just tremendous I'm really thrilled about what took place last week but more importantly 2,000 years ago when Jesus uh Rose back from the dead when he resurrected what took place next what took place after the resurrection well uh the followers of Jesus immediately spent some time with Jesus as would be expected for for a few weeks and then Jesus ascended uh to the Heavens to to the father but before Jesus ascended he did something he commissioned his followers and he commissioned them to exponentially multiply his mission across the globe and as we discovered in the beginning of our series on the book of Acts called let's go the mission of Jesus was continued by the followers of Jesus and this is what they did when they went around the world they did exactly what Jesus did they preached good news to the poor they healed the broken they freed the captives and they brought Justice to the oppressed and because it's now just not Jesus only it's all of them doing it more and more of it was happening they walked and They Carried a spiritual power and authority with them wherever they went and throughout these power encounters we could identify that they were empowered by the Holy Spirit look at your neighbor and say empowered by the spirit ow by the spirit see I want you to get this they were empowered by the Holy Spirit the holy spirit that we're talking about is the spirit of God as in Father Son and Holy Spirit when I grew up we called him the Holy Ghost okay but now we call him the Holy Spirit they were doing the same Ministry of Jesus and even greater or more things than Jesus but for every Power encounter we see there is this interesting and direct line back to a previous and very important catalytic moment Jesus said just before he ascended he gave a he gave the instruction and he told people what to do and we'll get to that in just a moment the scripture Bears out that if you want to see the kingdom of God uh this is this is what's going to happen if you in order to see the kingdom of God which is a critical question that's asked in the Bible how do I see the kingdom of God the scripture Bears out that every person that becomes a True Believer firstly a follower of Christ who accepts the forgiveness and Leadership of Christ has a spiritual occurrence that involves the spirit of God the Holy Spirit taking up residence in our lives we in that moment moment become the Temple of the Holy Spirit now we don't become God we become the vessel of God the temple of God so as we say a lot this Temple this building is not the house of God it is a warehouse of God's houses it is a factory assembling God's houses not in fact the house of God because the followers of Jesus are the houses of God no longer are we kidnapped Children Of Satan by but a child of God children of God so this is the first idea when that the Holy Spirit lives and dwells within us second is this shows up in our life as being born all over again like we're spiritually reborn we're spiritually renewed a a new birth occurs within us on this on this spiritual level now this language should be very familiar to Bible readers uh from an encounter that Jesus had with a spiritually Cur ious man and if you're not a Bible reader yet uh perhaps you've seen the dude in The End Zone on NFL games that holds up the sign it says John 3:16 all right all right so this is uh we're not going to get all the way to John 3:16 right now but it's the setup to that that verse so John chapter 3:1 there's this interesting encounter there was a man named Nicodemus a Jewish religious leader that was a Pharisee after dark one evening he came to speak with Jesus rabbi he said we all know that God has sent you to teach us your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you Jesus replied I tell you the truth unless you are born again there's that language born again you cannot see the kingdom of God now the comment the question that comes next is from Nicodemus Nicodemus is a very smart man and religious leader perhaps you've heard the uh idea that there's no such thing as a bad question I question that idea but because there seem to be lots of bad questions but Nicodemus uh asked an not particularly bright question uh to Jesus In This Moment he says what do you mean explained Nicodemus how can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be born again douh clearly this is not what Jesus was saying Jesus replied I assure you no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the spirit humans can reproduce only human life but the Holy Spirit watch this gives birth to spiritual life who gives birth to spiritual life the holy spirit so don't be surprised when I say you must be born again I want you to I want you to let that sink in today how do you become part of God's kingdom you must be born again and in verse six it clearly says that it is the holy spirit that gives birth to this new spiritual life so just to make sure you get this deep in your mind and heart the very moment that you call out to Jesus to accept his forgiveness and leadership in your life the holy spirit sets up residence in your life in that exact moment in that moment you become a temple of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit in effect baptizes us in Christ thus We join the body of Christ which is frequently called the church now baptism is a is a popular Bible word and it means lots of different things depending on when and how it is used but just to recap because I don't want you to get this all messed up later on is the building that we call a church building is the building the house of God no okay people are how do you see the kingdom of God you must be born again first two things you must be born again if you're going to see the kingdom of God uh the building is not the house of God and third who does the spiritual birthing in you the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit does the spiritual birthing of you these are really important things for us to get so if you're like okay what's going on here Pastor can you please tell a fun story right now this is getting a little heady here for me all right stay with me okay this is really important now let's go back all the way to the book of Acts the book of Acts is not just a historical account it that tells a historical narrative acts is communicating a theological truth and it is a set of clearly laid out action steps on how to fulfill the mission of Jesus so when you read the book of Acts it's not just supposed to be read as like oh that's interesting history it's supposed to be read as the followers of Jesus were empowered by the Holy Spirit and then they went out and they preached good news they healed the broken they freed a captive brought Justice to the oppressed and that's what we're supposed to do as well and this is how I can do it so this moment when Jesus tells his followers what to do is as he's about to depart so this what we've been waiting on acts chap 1 verse 4 and 5 Jesus says right before he's getting ready to take off once he was eating with them he commanded themo not leave Jerusalem until the father sends you the gift he promised as I told you before John baptized with water but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit now again the language of baptism was very common at the time there's lots of ceremonial cleansings and baptising happening in those days before the people would go to the temple to worship before the Jews would go to the temple temp to worship there was all of these little little functionally like little baptismal tanks they would go and they would get in the water they would ritually purify themselves cleanse themselves then go on in to the temple but this idea of baptism here and all of this is about this cleansing language is about being set apart it's about being consecrated or made holy or made unique or missionally aligned ready to execute what it is that God has for you the plans and purposes he has for you it's one thing for God to have a plan and a purpose for your life it's another thing for you to be empowered to do that and this is what we're getting to today go back even further go back to the prophets and kings of old and what would happen in the book of 1st Samuel chapter 16 you have the prophet Samuel and young David who becomes the future king of Israel verse 13 as David the Future King stood among his brothers Samuel took a flask of olive oil not just a little bit a lot a lot of olive oil that he had brought and anointed David with the oil and the spirit of the Lord Came powerfully Upon David from that day on I want you to see the visual he takes this flask of oil and he dumps it on top of David's head just because pours over him it's covering him the prophet anoints David with the oil and similar languages what we read the Holy Spirit empowers David this is an intentionally similar concept and the language of being baptized with the Holy Spirit uh that that we're reading in Acts there is this idea of the baptism or the anointing of the holy spirit that is intimately connected both in the Old Testament and the new to powerful living so King David was anointed and empowered by the holy Spirit to live powerfully like and given like giant killing power Nation leading power Philistine defeating power moabit defeating power overcoming power which is the same kind of power that the holy spirit gives to us today then we have this ancient Prophet named Joel somebody say Joel Joel so this ancient Prophet named Joel who speaks the words of God and he speaks them in Joel 2: 28 a back with this then after doing all those things I will pour out my spirit on all people you get the imagery of pouring like of the of the flask of oil being poured out like Samuel did to David okay pour out my spirit upon all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men will see Visions in those days I will pour out my spirit even on servants men and women alike and I will cause wonders in the heavens and on Earth blood and fire and Columns of smoke the sun will become dark tomorrow anyhow and the moon will turn blood red before that great and terrible day of the Lord arrives but everyone who calls on the name name of the Lord will be saved now this is a wild Prophecy with great imagery okay but I want I want you get it it's pre it's it's pre Jesus walking on the earth and it's talking about the time of Acts chap that Jesus is talking about in Acts chapter one but at that all people can receive the power of the Holy SP Spirit what this means is this the power the empowerment of the holy spirit is no longer just for prophets and Kings and Priests it's not just for the the King David of the era it's for all people but not just prophets not just Kings but sons and daughters so it's not just men it's also women and young and old so it's not just old and mature people it's also young and soon to be mature people and it talks about servants and it so it's for rich people and for poor people nobody's excluded from the empowerment the opportunity to be empowered by the spirit the spirit will be poured out for all somebody say all I don't want you to miss it for all to receive and then Jesus closes out his Earthly Ministry uh amongst us with these words and these words are for me and you and the disciples in Jerusalem that acts 18 he says but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes uh upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem throughout Judea in Samaria and to the ends of the Earth this acts 18 setup is the exact moment that the prophet Joel talked about that we just read this is the moment that the spirit is for everyone and they're living it they're right there in the moment living it and honestly so are we today the spirit is being poured out upon them and it is available to be poured out upon all people including us today so for this purpose so that they might continue the mission of Jesus to their neighbors their Community their people and the whole world now the mission is going to be amazing but it's going to be very difficult it'll be Monumental but and miraculous but it will not be something that you can do on your own your fancy thoughts and plans that's great but you're going to need help and you're going to need each other and you're going to need the empowerment of the Holy Spirit to fulfill the mission of God in your life Zechariah 4:6 it was in one of the lyrics of the song we sang earlier this is what the Lord says to zerubabel it's not by force nor by strength but by my spirit says the Lord of Heaven's armies what does that mean it means your fancy plans and your bougie education and your fine-tuned trade skills or your proud degree from the School of Hard Knocks while those things may all be interesting parts of your story those are the thing those things are fundamentally not what is going to help you fulfill the will of God God to do the mission of Jesus you will need to use all of those gifts that you have been given and all the things from your past but they will not be enough in the end we will still need to be Reliant upon the spirit of God because it's not by our own strength not by our own power but by the holy spirit that it is accomplished John the Baptist uh was out teaching about the Messiah and he was baptizing people to repentance in the water so he'd be out this is just prior to to Jesus coming on the scene full force and and John's out there and he's like there the Messiah is coming the Messiah is coming get right get right turn from your sins and people are responding they're getting baptized repenting of their sins and he says this in Matthew chapter 3:1 John the Baptist talking about Jesus says he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire so when you engage with the Bible you will see these p uh moments uh particularly powerful moments particularly in the book of Acts and I want you to pause and remember it's not being done with human wisdom and power it's being done by people that have been empowered by the Holy Spirit Jesus has baptize them with the Holy Spirit and fire just like John the Baptist said he would and this is for us right now Jesus invites us to the same place of empowerment not for our Glory not for our platform not for our purposes he invites us to wait on him just like he told the early followers wait in Jerusalem wait wait for the spirit to empower you he invites us to to wait on him to be empowered for his purposes so we've been jumping around the Bible all over the place today I know so we're going to come all the way to Acts 19 while Apollos was in Corinth Paul traveled through the interior regions until he reached Ephesus so they're in the city of Ephesus now where he found several Believers did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed he asked them no they replied we haven't even heard that there is a holy spirit then what baptism did you experience he asked and they replied the baptism of John Paul said John's baptism called for repentance from sin but John himself told the people to believe in the one who would come later meaning Jesus as soon as they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then this is after their baptism then when when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in other tongues and prophesied there were about 12 men in all so there's this interesting moment that takes place Paul is in the great city of Ephesus and he meets this group of Believers and he's take he's he's going there to make sure that these Believers these young Christians have the tools that they need in order to do the mission of Jesus because doing the mission of Jesus Takes some effort you need the tools you need the right tools and Paul understands that the most important tool they need is to be empowered by the spirit so he jumps right into making sure that they have being empowered by the spirit hey how you doing nice to meet you have you have you met the Holy Spirit have you been full of I didn't even know there's a holy spirit let's take care of business right now let's go that's that's kind of the theme that's the kind of the the the how it's going he discovers that had not met the Holy Spirit or been empowered by the holy spirit in a way that they understood and immediately lays hands on them they are baptized in the Holy Spirit the spirit is watch this poured out Old Testament language poured out upon them like Joel prophesied several times in the book of Acts at least five times we see these very similar type stories of moments of empowerment whether in Jerusalem or Ephesus or Samaria or Damascus we see and we are given these accounts within the context of the story about the early church to remind us again acts is not just history it is what we're supposed to do this is about continuing the mission of Jesus with the power of the holy spirit because you can't fulfill the mission of Jesus without the empowerment of the Holy Spirit that's the idea here as the worship team comes up and this empowerment is available it's available for us this Bible encourages us to receive this empowerment throughout throughout the stories it is the normal and normative experience and even necessary for all who desire to fulfill his mission and purposes so what is this empowerment all about though this idea of power this idea of empowerment is appealing to some simply because of the word power this idea that there will some as a powerful person I will gain something but the this kind of power is not that this is a power that gives this is a power that serves this is a power to love a power to free it's a very different kind o of empowerment and so you think well how how is it that one can be empowered to give I can give you an example of that a few years ago there was a really strategic moment in our Church's story where our church was at a Crossroads we had to make some pretty important decisions and uh it seemed that we could tell that they were important and it seemed critical that we make the right right choice it's a normal Sunday morning for us we were meeting over at Engles Elementary School at the time after church my wife and I we go back uh where we lived on Chestnut Street and we hear a knock on the door and and we open up the door to find some people that we had only met once before several years earlier and uh they were from Connecticut and they had driven up uh they had uh they were trying to make it in time for our church service and they got there they got lost and they got they were late and they couldn't figure out where in the world we might be somehow they managed to see our our church uh van going by at the time and they they followed the church van anyhow so they they they ended up knocking on the door of where we were at and at first it took us a minute we didn't quite remember who they were but then it clicked and then we invited them in said what's going on like thought maybe their marriage was in crisis or something and they just needed some help driving up from Connecticut and they're like no no no no we we woke up this morning and we're praying and and we felt like God told us to come up here and uh so they said first off God asked us to give this uh to the church and it was a check for significant money and and then they had some words of encouragement and then we prayed and then they left very brief just a couple of minutes honestly just a couple of minutes and you're like how much money was it well let me tell you this it wasn't enough money to change the world all right it wasn't enough money but it was enough money to make us go oh that's interesting God is paying attention to the crossroads we are at as a church like it's this is a real really important moment and God sent some acquaintances from Connecticut up to tell us this and this is just kind of enough to get your attention kind of thing and it was true it was really an important moment for us as a church and helped us they were being empowered by the spirit to listen to serve to obey to give sometimes the spirit empowers us uh to listen to him so that people might be healed several years ago I was called to a I know one of the worst types of uh appointments you can have and it's it's also a wonderful moment but it's a moment where I was asked to come to a parishioner's home to help them plan their own funeral because they had been given a notification by the doctors that they were at the end stages of longtime struggle with AIDS and that it was time for them to make their plans and make their peace and all those kind of things it was a tough moment so I go over and it's it's a lengthy meeting we're literally writing down who's going to take the kids when you pass away that kind of it was very difficult time and so we're and time after a few hours we I'm I'm getting ready to leave getting ready to pray for them uh pray for her and she had a Christian friend that was there as well and just before I started to pray I was very much prompted by the Holy Spirit and I asked I I know this is going to sound weird but have you ever asked God to heal you like we just spent hours talking through what takes place after you die well what if God's not done like what if God wants to heal you and she goes I've never asked God to heal me and I said well is it okay is it okay if I pray that God heals you she said absolutely so we began to pray that God would heal her after the prayer I talked to her Christian friend and her and I said can you guys do something can you like ask God every day take this before God and ask God to heal her I don't know all the details of what took place and how God did what he did but I know this we were planning a we were planning a funeral for any moment and she's still alive today and she's planning her future many many years into the future [Music] now what what am I saying I'm saying when the Holy Spirit empowers us comes in a lot of different ways and sometimes it's exciting and sometimes it's quiet but he empowers us and it's not me that's doing it it's maybe me me being obedient or God's doing something and facilitating it through US sometimes it's empowerment to overcome just overcoming that life-controlling problem or challenge or bondage or curse and and the spirit's empowerment allows you to overcome and be free once and for all sometimes it's empowerment to communicate with words that weren't yours words that only came from the holy spirit so that you might speak to others with perhaps the wisdom that you did not learn from man these are all gifts that come from the holy spirit in the right moment at the right time when we are empowered by the spirit so don't do it in your own power [Music] do it in the power of the Holy Spirit and see what God will do would you stand with me as we close [Music] today there is much much much much much more to this idea of being empowered by the spirit so we're just laying the the groundwork for it right now I'm going to ask you this if this has resonated with you today and you recognize I need the empowerment of the Holy Spirit do what Jesus told the early followers to do to wait they were supposed to wait in Jerusalem we're not in Jerusalem so you can wait whatever City you live in right now okay so wait wait for the Holy Spirit allow him to empower you ask him invite him in Holy Spirit I invite you in I invite you into this moment I invite you into my life I invite you into my situations I invite you to empower me with your [Music] spirit maybe you need that empowerment to do the mission of Jesus you are committed you're on the right team you're ready to go and now you need his empowerment empowerment of the spirit to do the mission of Jesus maybe it's you need to overcome that life control problem and you need his empowerment maybe it's the empowerment to overcome those breaking of bondages and curses that have been placed upon your life and it's time to be free and you need the empowerment of the Holy Spirit we are cracking the door open for this today so that you might invite this to occur in your life we're not done talking about it but we're done talking about it for today now let's spend some time in prayer the worship team can can lead us in this but respond respond to the Holy Spirit today respond to how he would Lead You In This Moment to see to seek his empowerment in our lives the altars are open let's spend some time in prayer", "ouch oh yeah that's good good morning everybody the uh just a minute we're gonna read one verse of the Book of James just one verse okay now what I want you to do is I want you to pull out your phone or your Bible if if you don't have your physical Bible bring your phone open your Bible app up and go to James chapter 1 verse one but why why you're going there Emily Pastor Emily have you have you been to the loft yet yes yes I have the Loft at Stetson great what do you think about the Loft at Stats it's amazing yeah it's pretty cool it's incredible um it's neat what's going on over there I don't know if you know this but uh the Chamber of Commerce uh nominated it as one of the Rookie of the Year businesses for this year and uh so on the screen how convenient is that on the screen uh you can see uh you can go vote you can go vote there's like lots of different categories and you can vote and I'm not telling you who to vote for we don't really do that here but there may be a circle around one of them that would help help lead you or guide you in a certain way up there right now okay so hopefully you found James chapter 1 verse run run right now so why are we reading this today because this has to do with our Bible engagement goal tell me about that what is our Bible engagement the month of February we have a goal for every month in February our goal is to read two books of the Bible the book of two teams two books the Book of James and the first letter from John okay we're not going to take a poll right now but I would be curious outside the Bible how many completed books did people read in the last 36 years it was like did it like the stats on reading are really bad terrible like not just hair I'm just like across the country people don't read like they don't read books they they buy books they don't read the books yeah it's like 80 of Americans something crazy like don't read a whole book in a year but the uh so we're asking them to read too Pastor Emily well two whole books yes so Pastor Germany and I battled out like how much to ask people to read and so she clearly won because she wants you to read two whole books of the Bible yeah but they're not that long they're really quite short they're both actually letters okay so they're not so when we say books of the Bible there's 66 books in the Bible but the book that you're talking about isn't actually a book right so explain what that is for everybody so James is a letter from James and first John is one of the letters that John wrote that's in the book so we're supposed to read the the whole book of James the whole book of James which is really just a letter yep that we call a book yes that's helpful and then we have first John yeah now I believe there are more than one John in the Bible there are yeah there's the Gospel of John um and then there's first second and third John those are letters that John wrote so you want to look for the one that has a number one before it so so first John will be the first John in in the New Testament yes this is actually by the way if you participated no it won't be wait what no no oh no wait say this first question again the first John will be the first John in the in the Bible no no no no it will not it'll be the second John it will be that's not helpful you're gonna confuse me second and second John will be third John and third John first John first John will be the first book that you see with the number one before and then the word John okay good that's helpful so it's nice that they made it really clear for us right when uh when they compiled all of this together yes it's such a clever idea um so John first John second John third John because we were supposed to read the first John which which isn't the question yeah but this month we're just reading James and first John and first John I'll just take you a second to read it's not very long and same thing with James James isn't very long it's actually less reading than January January was The Book of Mark which is longer which will give you a chance to catch up on Mark if you wanted to go back and catch up on Mark even though even though good news over a hundred of you uh made major progress or completed the whole book of Mark in January so it's great great news so and a whole bunch of you said I wanted to do that right yeah yeah which I don't know what that means but it's great I'm happy you wanted to um okay so we're going to read James chapter one and what are the questions that we've been asking in the month of January we were asking who what when where and why who what when where why and what is challenging about this passage and what is confusing about and what's confused okay that's to help you kind of put yourself in the situation I'm going to challenge you this month to ask yourselves three slightly different bits of information the first is who's the author who's the audience meaning the people reading it and when was it written or the date author audience and date author audience and date okay so we're going to go ahead and begin to read James chapter one verse one all right this letter is from James A Slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ I am writing to the 12 tribes Jewish Believers scattered abroad greetings all right I didn't even interrupt you you didn't even interact that's great so I made progress I'm making progress okay so James is on the screen here we are James uh James uh and then this is who we're talking about this guy named James James who is James is Jesus's half-brother now this is important information James is the half-brother of Jesus what we understand that to mean is that James is the child of Mary and Joseph obviously after Jesus was born okay so he's the younger half-brother of Jesus it's a it's really important to understand that uh there's actually a very interesting archaeological find about James that uh you can see on the screen right now it's called a bone box if you go ahead and just pull the screen up here this is a bone box uh but if you go to the next screen you'll notice that on this bone box is an inscription it's the um only a couple of these types of instruction inscriptions have ever been found and this one says James the son of Joseph the brother of Jesus they they found this James the son of Joseph the brother of Jesus and it's it's right there and uh it's understood that this is a valid archaeological find and there's a lot of reasons that it's very significant but it's talking about the James that wrote the book of James is what this is so just kind of some interesting info there so so James wrote a book of the Bible but isn't it interesting that uh I think it's interesting did you know that James has a brother that wrote another book of the Bible I do know that it's good good yeah I learned that research so Jesus wrote a book of the Bible no no not that brother not that so which brother was it Jude Jude so there's there's another book in the Bible called Jude now I love Jude and James these two books in the Bible because when I was a teenager I would commit to reading entire book of the Bible by the next Sunday so once I said I'm going to read a whole book of the Bible by next Sunday and it turns out the secret hack to that was to read Jude on your way to church because Jude just takes a minute to read okay it's really really short it just takes a minute and James just takes a few minutes to read so I love and it turns out that the brothers of Jesus yeah so I I like the fact that they're just really brief yeah very direct I've been talking longer than they wrote yes okay now tell us about Jesus and James and growing up so James grows up he's like man my brother is awesome he's the Messiah it's great yeah yeah not at all no no okay um Jesus's family did not know who he was until after he died and came back to life like they thought he was crazy yeah so there's this interesting we actually read it in Mark um at one point that but James really didn't understand who Jesus was they authentically he and his siblings um thought that Jesus was losing it maybe a little bit crazy and one time they tried to grab him out of a moment and save his life they were concerned he was going to get killed uh and because and that was part of the evidence and then Jesus had some really strong words to say to them his own family in that moment as well valid concern yeah I mean just think about it if your sibling said that they're the savior of the whole world well you sleep on the bunk next to me so I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure so you know you have to understand uh where they're coming from a little bit on that but after Jesus death and Resurrection James goes all in he recognizes uh Jesus as the Messiah and and what happens with James now so James is now a Believer he's the brother of Jesus and why is he even writing this letter how is this even possible that he goes from not believing to believing to now writing a book in the Bible he becomes a really important figure in the church at that time he became a leader so we're in the city of Jerusalem and James becomes the bishop the head pastor of the entire church Global uh he becomes the bishop of the Jerusalem Church and so here he's now writing to who who's he writing this to the 12 tribes the 12 tribes the 12 tribes of who the 12 tribes of Israel the 12 tribes of Israel now this is going to get it's going to get interesting there's 12 tribes of Israel but are there really 12 tribes of Israel apparently not apparently not okay so so there's actually a half try there's two half tribes so even though we call it the 12 tribes of Israel there's actually a two there's really you could call it almost 13 but we call it 12. there's a lot of variety of reasons why but we call it the 12 tribes it's really 13 groups but he's writing to these 12 tribes of Israel of Jewish uh people that are also Christians the Jewish and Christian because the earliest Christians were also Jewish they they didn't have a separation like in 2023 there's like a like two distinct religions but at this time uh Christianity was just uh the recognition that Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah yeah of of the Jewish people now James it turns out is not actually James's name so why does it say James why do we have at the very beginning of James chapter 1 verse one hey I'm James yeah names are really hard to translate yeah and they change a lot when you translate like in Spanish it's Santiago so you're right very different right very differently different uh and his real name is actually Jacob and you can see it like if you just if you go back into the language where his name was written it's obviously Jacob okay and it turns out that there's two other James's in the New Testament that are important to pay attention to the 12 disciples two of them were named James this is not the same James this is a third James the brother of Jesus because remember he didn't believe while Jesus was doing his Earthly Ministry so he's over here and these two are over here also their names are not James their names are also both Jacob Jacob and Jesus's name is not Jesus like what it's Yeshua which is Joshua right okay so these are just translation issues this is not something that should deeply impact your faith it's just good information for you you to know now do you have to know any of this to read the book of James no no you don't need to know anything I don't need to know any of it but it's cool so we just been wasting our time up here not at all no there's layers it's Rich you go deeper it's very exciting so you can understand James without knowing any of the stuff that we just talked about yes yes but now that you know the stuff we just talked about it is possible you will understand it even better yeah now just to throw this in there James was martyred for his faith in the year 62. in the year 62 he was the pastor or the bishop of the church in Jerusalem he was also Jewish okay they're all Jewish and so the Jewish high priest gets really frustrated about this calls them to the Temple Mount and takes him to the corner this place right at the edge of the Temple Mount and it calls on him to explain himself he declares Jesus as the Messiah they get angry at him and they throw him off the Temple Mount and he falls and he falls quite a ways it's a long way down and you you would usually die that's how high it is but he doesn't die he doesn't die he starts to pray for the people saying that they don't know what they're doing father please forgive them which is interesting because Jesus said the same thing and uh but they want to make sure he's dead so now they start to Stone him they start to Stone him to death for his faith in Jesus and then somebody goes and grabs the club and whacks him on the head and ends it so when I say that James went from non-believing to fully believing we're serious he wasn't just pretending to believe he'll be like hey guys I'm out if it wasn't real for him so so he literally sacrificed his life there good I think we're good thank you thank you thank you Pastor Emily all right I'm going to just finish the rest here for sake of time so that was the author the audience was the 12 tribes of Israel they were the earliest Christians and also Jewish and they were scattered across the region because there was now persecution happening much like James was killed for his faith other Christians had been killed for their faith as well and now they're scattering across the Mediterranean region of of the world okay and so he's writing this letter to encourage them all over and this is fun this was probably written in the year 44. that's 11 years after Jesus raised from the dead that's important because that makes this the earliest book in in the New Testament and uh it's it's a powerful thing to put all of that together okay so we're jumping into our new series today called Financial Ethics in the Kingdom somebody say ethics yeah it might be the first time you said that in a few years the word ethics it's not a con it's not a common word that we use all the time but here we go imagine the economy is failing sin is rampant and on full display with no remorse people are being displaced moving from place to place hoping to find a better way to live or a better place to live better employment opportunities better housing than natural disaster has hit and people are literally starving to death it is a difficult time and it's not today it's 3 500 years ago and it's 3 500 years ago and we aren't introduced to one of the greatest heroes in all of the Bible she is one of the great grandmothers of Jesus she has been in the midst of great personal upheaval her husband and his entire family prior to that meeting had moved and migrated to her country the country of Moab somebody say Moab Moab then after she was married to her husband this all this bad stuff happens and her husband dies due to the famine in Moab and his brother also died and so now there's two two widows that are left and the Mother-in-law who is also a widow the lady we're talking about today her name is Ruth the Mother-in-law Naomi releases her two daughter-in-laws to return to their families in Ruth chapter 1 verse 14 we pick up the story at this they wept again then orpha kissed her mother-in-law goodbye so she went back this is the other sister-in-law but Ruth clung to Naomi Luke said Naomi your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her Gods go back with her but Ruth replied don't ask me to leave you and turn back I will go wherever you go and live wherever you live you will be my people and your God will be my God I will die wherever you die and I will be buried there one of the greatest declarations in all of the Bible your people will be my people your God will be my God may the Lord punish me severely if I ever allow anything but death to separate us now Ruth just to keep you in this story here Ruth is one of the great great grandmothers of Jesus and Ruth this moabite woman has decided that she is going to reject her Pagan past she's now going to choose wholeheartedly to begin to serve the one true and living God she has also decided to honor and care for and protect her mother-in-law after her husband had passed away so here we have this Israeli woman named Naomi and we have this afro-asiatic woman named Ruth there's a there's a phrase you don't hear all the time after Asiatic I highlight this to help you get your head around the richness of this story historically we have allowed artists to imagine Bible characters for us we let them do the hard work of drawing them out and painting them in the problem is they don't do this very accurately sometimes or depending on the era that they do it they just make it themselves or like somebody they know for example there's this famous painting of Ruth that we're talking about up on the screen right now Ruth in this picture if she was in the Middle East or Moab she would get a sunburn okay all right for real look at that picture okay so it's very much not at all what Ruth would have looked like it Ruth would have been much closer to this in the way that she would have looked now imagine these types of things I want you to do this I want you when you're reading the scripture to imagine these types of things when you're reading the story it will help you understand the moment and help you understand the broad depth of scripture it's like moving from one place to another if you read the Bible and you don't imagine the people that you're you're reading they'll just be like little stick figures in your head like it's moving from place to place but if you fill them out and put a personality on them you it'll help you it'll help you see uh the richness of scripture as you're reading now Ruth had made up her mind to seek and follow God she deliberately chose the god of Israel Over the gods of her past and today I would challenge each and every one of us in a room today purposefully and deliberately seek the god of the Bible if the one who created the stars and the heavens and the one who formed you and your mother's womb the one who loves you with an eternal and everlasting love listen to this the Bible says if we seek him with all of our heart we will find him and I would encourage you just like Ruth chose God I would encourage you to choose him as well today now we are talking about financial ethics and so where are we getting we're not doesn't seem like we're there yet but we're getting close this next passage read through the lens of financial ethics Ruth the story continues so Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by her daughter-in-law Ruth so this is the two of them the young moabite woman they arrived in Bethlehem Bethlehem does that ring like what I've heard I've heard that name before Bethlehem a little town of Bethlehem right you know you've heard it you've heard you've heard Bethlehem before so don't let that go hold on to it Circle it underline it highlight it it's kind of important it will be important 1500 years from now okay and the Bible moves pretty quick so you don't really have to wait 1500 years Bethlehem in late spring at the beginning of the barley Harvest here they are in Bethlehem yes that Bethlehem which would 1500 years later become the most favored Town ever in the history of humanity ever even to this day where The Rescuer of the whole world is going to someday be born imagine just for a moment if there was an award ceremony every year for towns and Villages and cities and they got together for a convention every year New York City would come in boasting of its famous residents and fancy buildings La would boast over global influence Dubai would list off her greatest accomplishments in Rome would speak of its enduring Empire but no matter what would happen at that convention there is never ever ever going to be any other city that would receive the most important town in human history award there will only ever be this one moment in one cave in one town in the one and only Bethlehem in which the grandson of Ruth would someday be born Jesus Christ so here they are in that Bethlehem it wasn't that Bethlehem yet but it was having a big setup here they are Naomi and Ruth in Bethlehem broke busted and disgusted they are hungry they are hungry and here we begin to see biblical Financial ethics start to kick in there was a wealthy and influential man in Bethlehem named Boaz who was a relative of Naomi's husband elimelech one day Ruth said to Naomi let me go out into the fields to gather leftover grain behind anyone who will let me do it and Naomi said all right my daughter go ahead so Ruth went out to gather grain behind the Harvesters and as it happened she found herself working in a field that belonged to Boaz the relative of her father-in-law elimelech while she was there Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the Harvesters the Lord be with you he said the Lord blessed you the Harvesters replied then Boaz asked his Foreman who is that girl over there here is a wealthy man has a lot of workers in the field and yet he sees Ruth standing out he's she is worthy of his attention why because clearly her work ethic has caused him to ask who she is she's got a work ethic about her even today even today when you go into a place of employment or a place of business and you notice somebody taking pride in their work they stand out as an exception you're like oh I wanna I want that person I want to work with that person we can all learn from Ruth a principal taught in scripture in First Corinthians chapter 10. whatever you do it all for the glory of God so whether you sweep floors or count numbers or build stuff or tear it down let your attitude be the same as if you were doing it for God himself you see when people work with that kind of an attitude they find themselves having the favor of those that are in authority over them placed upon them something of note here is this Ruth was not even an employee she was on an ancient biblical welfare system provided for by God called gleaning she was picking up grain that Harvesters had left behind she was hungry so she worked Leviticus chapter 19 this is where the law comes from when you harvest your crops do not harvest the grain along the edges of your Fields do not pick up with the Harvesters drop it is the same with your grape cup do not strip every last bunch of grapes from The Vines and do not pick up the grapes that fall to the ground leave them for the poor and the foreigners who live among you for I the Lord am your God so God understood that there would always be those that are poor and he has a special place in his heart for the poor but his system of overcoming that defeats what we would call today being lazy for the poor who were willing to work God had made provision for them in the law but for anyone that was unwilling to work they should go hungry second Thessalonians chapter 3 says whoever does not work should not eat wow not out of meanness this is actually an act of compassion and correction that we were built to work let me be clear the financial ethics of the kingdom of God begin with work somebody say work work okay I've been told not to say that I've been told also not to say work work work work work or something so um here's the ethics work is a blessing work is part of our purpose work honors the dignity and Humanity of people if a person is physically able to work then it is God's design that they be able to work because work contributes to human flourishing because work allows us to use the gifts and talents that God has given us and God honoring purpose-filled work will also contribute to a better overall mental health as well and lots of other things in the midst of all of this ethic around uh Financial ethics and the the work being at the center there are even warnings about get rich quick and lazy Financial strategies to wealth lots of people almost everybody wants to be wealthy maybe not everybody but almost everybody wants to be wealthy and the Bible warns us a lot Proverbs Chapter 13 says wealth from get rich quick schemes quickly disappears well from Hardware it grows over time we need to post that outside every gas station in the city of Lynn I don't know why I don't know why the government doesn't listen to me when I preach the Bible like this but I tell you I I don't understand why we are robbing the poor taxing the poor we have a pop culture expression that is emerging called passive income and it has different meanings but one of the meanings one of the bad meanings of this is the common meeting meaning which is a way to make money without doing anything or creating anything this is not God's plan it's frequently a code this passive income ideas frequently a code for how can I be lazy and still make money which the Bible defines as being idle or idleness in fact listen to this strong set of warnings from scripture proverbs 10 4 lazy people are soon poor hard workers get rich 26 lazy people irritate their employers like vinegar to the teeth or smoke in the eyes I really have to go try the vinegar to the teeth thing I have no idea what that's talking about right there um Proverbs 12 24 work hard and become a leader be lazy become a slave that's called MasterCard and Visa Proverbs 12 27 lazy people don't even cook the game they catch but the diligent make use of everything they find 13-4 lazy people want much but get little but those who work hard will prosper so in the kingdom of God Financial ethics start with work why do you think as a church that we have stepped into this Arena we have started two social Enterprises to assist people in working the cafe and the loft are there to assist people in working we understand that the devil has disrupted the process of learning how to work by destroying families and the system is corrupted and creates barriers for people in climbing up out of poverty and re-establishing their lives we're trying to work to tear down those barriers and give people the Dignity of work I can't possibly take the time this morning needed to talk about all the issues involved with this or all the challenges that need to be overcome to make this a reality in every person's life but at the core of biblical Financial ethics is work work is the first standard of Kingdom Financial ethics next let's not be afraid to embrace God's Prosperity or God's abundance now this is the if you're like you should have led with that Pastor you should have led let's not be afraid okay well it comes after on purpose the overwhelming Council of scripture is that work and wisdom results in access to abundance that's the that's the overarching uh instruction of scripture now we're going to read a lengthy passage of scripture from Proverbs chapter 31. and I want you to pay attention to how work and wisdom are connected to this individual's abundance I want you to watch that as the worship team comes up Proverbs chapter 31 now it's primarily describing a virtuous woman here but this can be applied to everybody who can find a virtuous and capable wife she is worth more than precious rubies her husband can trust her and she will greatly enrich his life she will not hinder him but help him all of her life she finds wool and flax and busily Spins it she's like a merchant ship she brings her food from afar she gets up Before Dawn to prepare breakfast for her household and plans the day's work for her servant girls she goes out to inspect the field and buys it with her earnings she plants a Vineyard she is energetic and strong a hard worker she watches for bargains she her lights burn late in the night her hands are busy spinning thread her fingers twisting fiber she extends a helping hand to the poor and opens her arms to the needy she has no fear of winter for her household because all of them have warm clothes she quilts her own bread spread she dresses like royalty in gowns of finest cloth her husband is well known for he sits in the council meeting with the other Civic leaders she makes belted linen garments and sashes to sell to the merchants she is clothed with strength and dignity and she laughs with no fear of the future when she speaks her words are wise and kindness is the rule which she gives when she gives instructions she carefully watches all that goes on in her household and does not have to bear the consequences of laziness her children stand and bless her her husband Praises her there are many virtuous and capable women in the world but you surpass them all charm is deceptive and Beauty does not last but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised reward her for all she has done let her Deeds publicly declare her praise this proverbs 31 list is easily transferable to the life we live in 2023. there is no way suggesting that this is in no way suggesting that our end goal is to pursue money that's not the real Point here rather it's espousing the reality that virtue is connected to work the fear of the Lord is connected to work words of faith and and talking are irrelevant unless one's work and deeds give evidence to their faith that's all happening inside of proverbs 31. we've noticed that even in retirement years there are many that no longer need money because they were wise with money in their younger years yet they recognize in order to stay engaged and fulfilled they still need to work or volunteer on many more significant levels in our own Ministry in the last 22 years it was full-time and part-time volunteers that have built some of our most significant Ministries because their purpose because purpose is still connected to work you see God uses work to accomplish his purposes in our lives and in the lives of other people as well so as we start this series the financial ethics of the Kingdom the first ethic is that of work would you stand with me as we close [Music] so today is respond how do you respond how do you reflect it's a time to evaluate evaluate where you're at with work maybe even where you're at with wisdom about work and is work and your life purpose connected are you working in ways that are completely dis disconnected from your purpose or are you bringing those closer and closer together there's a lot of things to consider and think about here but let's let's just evaluate that consider that as the worship team leads us in this last song [Music]", "[Music] [Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting today we're focusing on the idea that prayer breaks spiritual strongholds one of the awesome results of prayer is that we are able to bring down strongholds that the enemy has built up today's scripture comes to us from the book of daniel chapter 10 verse 13. now let me set this up for you so what's happening is daniel has been praying and fasting for 21 days and nothing is happening have you ever been praying and you're like why is nothing happening at the end of 21 days an angel shows up and lets him know why it has taken so long for him to hear back from his prayers and essentially gives him and us a sneak peek at the behind the scenes of what happens when we pray and why is the answer to our prayers often delayed have you ever wanted to know that this scripture brings a lot of clarity because he lets daniel know daniel there's much more happening behind the scenes than you know that you are aware of or that you could possibly understand but because you have persevered and continued praying i've been sent here by god with an answer to your prayer but i was blocked along the way let's read it together angel's speaking to daniel it says but for 21 days the spirit prince of the kingdom of persia blocked my way now notice that this is a spirit prince it says then michael one of the archangels came to help me and i left him there with the spirit prince of the kingdom of persia so notice that daniel has been praying he has been fasting he has been asking god and for 21 days he doesn't hear anything but it doesn't mean that nothing is happening there is actually a spiritual battle going on because of daniel's prayer so every time you pray there is something happening but it says here this spirit prince blocked my way i don't know if you've ever felt that way like there was something blocking you either blocking your prayers or blocking your walk with jesus or blocking your growth whatever it is this is an indicator that there's more going on than meets the eye your prayers are doing more accomplishing more than you are aware of it shows us that this is why we have to pray this is why we cannot give up we don't know how long it will take for you to see the answer to your prayer so don't give up our prayers can make a difference and right now i want us to pray for the lives of the people in our family and our friends who are far from god and know that there are things happening in the spiritual world that we're not aware of doesn't mean we can't pray won't you join me with prayer god today we i just want to bring before you god the lives of our friends and families who are far from you and god we ask you right now to bring down the strongholds and the obstacles that keep people from coming to you and from knowing you god your scripture sheds light into the idea that there is more happening than we could possibly understand but that you have given us the weapon of prayer and right now we pray for our loved ones we pray for people who are far from you we pray for the impossible situations god that you would show up god and we know that there are things that are trying to block us there are spiritual forces there are principalities there are all kinds of things in in the kingdom of darkness that are trying to suppress us we just call on you now god by faith declare victory in jesus name we want to advance your kingdom we want to see freedom we want to see a breakthrough in the lives of the people we love even though we know there is a battle we know that ultimately you have already won at the cross you've stripped these principalities of their power and authority continue god advancing your kingdom through us and we pray god to see results we pray that people who right now god seem like there's no way that they could possibly respond to your call we pray that they would respond wow god maybe god is calling me maybe god is speaking to me whatever it takes god we will not give up in prayer we will not give in to the enemy but we're going to press through because you are good and your promises never fail thank you for all of this in jesus name [Music] amen you", "[Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting we're gonna get started right away you are listening to pastor dave and we are on day two of this series we've titled you will receive power these are the words that were spoken by jesus there are some powerful words it's a powerful promise for you and i today and we're going to be specifically addressing this idea today of refocus refocus what comes to your mind when you hear this word have you ever lost focus on of something important and you had to refocus well that's what we're going to be talking about today from the beginning and i want to start with a question for you when was the last time you watched a movie ending that was completely unexpected perhaps you were watching a tv series and you were at the finale and it ended abruptly or in a way you totally did not see coming when was the last time that happened to you i'll think about that and hold on to that for a moment so for about three years the earliest followers of jesus were living their best lives like literally they were waking up every day they were sitting with jesus eating with jesus they were listening to his teaching directly from the mouth of jesus they were watching him perform incredible miracles like can you imagine that doesn't that make you a little jealous like i wish that i could have been there and seen jesus physically and they saw him for three years and then something unexpected happens jesus is betrayed by one of his closest followers and he's killed horrifically he's put up on a cross he dies the death of a criminal and then what follows is that these early disciples are all scattered they're afraid and then there's persecution that arises against them there's literally a hunt to find these disciples and everyone is terrified now if this had been the end of the story the end of the movie so to speak this would have been a really depressing ending but thankfully it wasn't because see another plot twist took place right away and it was that jesus rose from the dead three days later and then he appeared to his disciples and what jesus found was he realized his followers were disoriented they were confused they were focused more on self-preservation and they started kind of thinking in terms of politics more than on fulfilling their purpose and so jesus had to take a moment and help them refocus and he says these incredible words in acts 1 8 he said to them but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea in samaria into the ends of the earth what we can gather from this first look at the scripture is the following principle that prayer helps us to refocus on god's agenda i'll say that again prayer helps us refocus on god's agenda it is natural for us to come to a moment of prayer with things that we want to invite god to do that's certainly okay and god invites us to do that there are moments where we need god to intervene where we need god to show up where without god's help we're not gonna make it and it's okay to let god know but equally important is the idea that we need to align ourselves with what god is trying to do why because god sees things from a different plane from a different focus from a broader understanding an understanding that we could never truly understand because we're limited we're only human beings and god is god so in prayer we have an opportunity to be able to gain clarity about what god wants to do in our world and then we're able to align ourselves accordingly so what does this look like well for example in prayer we might go in feeling a certain way a certain anxiety a certain fear and then we're made to realize when we're spending time with god that we were meant to be victorious overcomers we're not meant to live in shame or fear you know we might go in there thinking about god what's best for me how do i get ahead in life what's going to what's going to put me over the top and then we come out of these moments with god realizing that our primary privilege in life is to serve others we might go in there with an idea of self-preservation you know it's all about what's happening to me and my experience but i have a bigger role to play i'm part of god's church and my role is to help advance god's kingdom here on earth so god's promise for us today is this you don't have to do this in your own ability jesus told his earliest followers i'm sending you a helper i'm sending the holy spirit to help you understand the magnitude of what i've called you to what an amazing experience that is when when it happens in prayer when you're going in a certain way and you're coming out differently because you've seen the bigger picture because you realize how much god loves people and how he's chosen you you are his vessel you are his instrument to bring hope to the world and so i want to end in prayer today and i want to invite god to come through right where we're at and help us to refocus as we pray today as we spend time with him let us pray right now heavenly father thank you for sending us your holy spirit thank you that we're able to receive from the holy spirit true understanding of what your point of view is where you're coming from and what you're wanting to accomplish in our world and god we understand that you are god and that we have a limited worldview help us to refocus on the way that you see the world god as we're reading scripture today highlight for us things that you want us to do that you created us for and god even if it seems intimidating even if it seems like there's no way i could possibly achieve this god we know that you give us not just the will but you give us the supernatural ability to do it thank you for doing that and i pray for every one of the people listening right now god would you give them power would you fill them with your holy spirit right now give them boldness give them a bigger world vision give them a bigger understanding of what you're doing god thank you for being active and being intricately involved in every aspect of the world's affairs and god we know that you're fighting you're fighting for us right now help us to learn how we can be a part of that fight god we love you today and we pray all these things in jesus name amen as we end our time of prayer i'm going to leave this wonderful music playing don't be in a rush don't feel led to just end because i'm ending but if you want to continue praying feel free to do so god bless you and we'll see you tomorrow [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "[Music] [Applause] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting today we are focusing on praying for our leaders and as we do i'd like to read from proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 and this is what it says trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways submit to him and he will make your path straight one of our greatest responsibilities as followers of jesus is to pray for our leaders if you think about it our leaders are at the forefront of this spiritual warfare and it is essential for them to have the wisdom they need to make the decisions that will advance the kingdom of god because our leaders pray for us they encourage us they watch over our souls and it is up to us to lift them up to god and say god would you give them wisdom would you help them would you give them creativity would you guard them from the traps of the enemy these are all things that we can do when we pray now today i want to pray very specifically for the leaders in our church people who oversee ministries people who have influence in one way or another uh we pray for them i want to pray for our church network we're part of a network of churches we pray that our leaders would be given more wisdom and more ability and more power to lead us well this is important and last but not least we'll pray for our church and our nation at large and the leaders that oversee the national church that they would be given wisdom and power and ability to do whatever it takes to advance god's reign here in the united states and that he would make us a beacon of hope a beacon of light as we share the message of jesus so why don't we pray right now god today we give you thanks for great leaders we give you thanks for the people that you've placed over us to watch over our souls to care for us to pastor us to mentor us god they need wisdom from heaven to advance heaven's agenda and so you are the one that is able to speak to them and lead them god would you give them supernatural wisdom would you guard them from the enemy would you open doors for them god let your kingdom advance god would you raise up new leaders would you strengthen the leaders that are there right now we know that we are in a war and we know that god we need generals for your kingdom to rise up and so god i pray that the generals that are over us now god we we honor them we pray for them we thank you for them we lift up their families and their children and their grandchildren and everything that is a part of who they are god that it would be blessed that he would be protected god we pray for those leaders right now god who may be going through a difficult season would you encourage them would you raise people in those churches god who would stand up next to them and support them and uh god we know that as a church in the united states god we need you we pray that you would fill us with desire for more of you god let us not be content god and we pray right now that you would strengthen the arms of our current national leaders god if there's anyone that is tired that is weary that feels alone god would you send help would you send angels to strengthen them god would you send people to encourage them whatever it takes god would you strengthen our leaders would you help them god to advance your kingdom with boldness give them boldness in the face of opposition in the face of persecution in the face of ridicule whatever it is god for your kingdom to advance we pray for bold leaders we pray that you would give them insight into how to outsmart the devil how to how to bring your kingdom from heaven to earth and god we know that we are having called for such a time as this to give our leaders boldness would you give them power from heaven to advance your kingdom work we pray for our leaders god and we thank you for them in jesus name we pray amen you", "[Music] [Music] hey east coast international church welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting today we will be reminding ourselves that with god all things are possible today's scripture comes from matthew chapter 19 verse 26 jesus looked at them intently and said humanly speaking it is impossible but with god everything is possible have you ever faced a situation that made you feel hopeless where you exerted all of your efforts all of your energy all of your thoughts in trying to make something happen or trying to earn god's love i know i've felt this way before i gave my life to jesus i felt hopeless and worthless i felt like i was looking for love in all the wrong places and i felt i had to just continue to strive to earn his love even when i began attending church regularly i noticed that my life outside of church wasn't even changing i still felt hopeless it wasn't until i actually sat down and prayed to god that i would have a relationship with him and asked him to lead my life that things started to change and one by one jesus broke the shackles off of my life as i prayed to him as i handed things over to him and asked him for that transformation and that newness of life in him and so friends today in the midst of our hopelessness let's choose to pray for breakthrough in those areas of our lives let's choose to pray for breakthrough in our friends and our families and in the situations that they're facing let's pray together god thank you so much that with you all things are possible that even in our hopeless situations god that we can find hope in you jesus we pray for all of the situations that we're facing whether it's in our families in our workplaces in our friends lives in our neighbors lives the people that we've invited to church the people that we've reached out to to try to share your love god we know that through you all things are possible you know the situations that they're going through and that we're going through and you know what needs to be done in order to bring freedom and healing so i pray today that we would just continue to surrender all of our hopelessness to you all of the situations that need your healing god let us hand them all over to you let us lift those situations in intercession for our families and those that we love and watch what you will do we love you and it's in jesus name we pray [Music] amen [Music] thank you so much for joining us here today we hope that you'll continue to pray throughout the day and that you'll come back tomorrow as we continue our week of prayer and fasting god bless you", "[Music] [Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting congratulations you made it to the final day this is day seven thank you for making the time to connect with us in the series you will receive power it's the name of our series we've been getting into it we've been going deep and today's topic is love multiplies love multiplies this is a phrase that we love at our church because we truly believe that love multiplies that love is meant to be shared that the message of jesus is meant to be shared with others you know but sometimes there are obstacles and today i want to jump right in and i want to share an experience that i had one time when i was trying to share the gospel with someone and you know any time that we're stepping out and sharing the gospel there's always going to be someone trying to stop us mainly the devil but sometimes he uses people and he uses situations one time i was walking down the street inviting people to church just you know minding my own business and all of the sudden a man came up in a vehicle and you know he said hi and i recognized him and i went over and i said hi and mind you this was around maybe seven o'clock at night uh you know there were some street lamps and whatnot but it was really quiet there was not a lot of activity you know a few people here and there but you know nothing that we could call a disturbance of any kind so we started talking and mainly it was him telling me kind of what he had been up to updating me on his life and whatnot and then at one point as we were talking i felt like a shift in my heart like a prompting to tell this man about jesus no sooner did that thought come into my head and no sooner did i start telling him then all kinds of chaos broke loose there were you know shouts yelling screaming some kids even like right in front of us ran out into the street and they started sending out firecrackers those really loud ones that sound like bombs what a coincidence i've been talking to this man for you know a while now and you know i'm just listening to what he's saying but the minute that i get this prompting you know share jesus and i begin to tell him about jesus and that's where this conversation is heading all of a sudden there's all this chaos people running around noise music blasting like literally it was in that moment well we followers of jesus know that this is not a coincidence we understand because the bible teaches us that there are spiritual walls that keep people from seeing the light of jesus and so in that moment when i realized what was happening first of all i started praying in my spirit as i was trying to talk to the man and i kind of dug my heels in a little bit because i like i've seen the enemy do this before where he's trying to interrupt something that is going to bring freedom into somebody's life and it's not going to work i'm not going to back down and i uh you know started spiritually multitasking you know praying for the man and then listening to him and then beginning to tell him about jesus and thankfully i was able to tell him the message of jesus but the reality is when we share our faith with others when we call people back to god the bible says that god is making his appeal through us in that moment like think about that for a moment when you share the message of jesus with other people you are speaking on behalf of god because god desires to bring people back to himself people who are far from him they're his creation god misses his creation and so we get to be ambassadors of the good news and so i want to land on this principle today it takes supernatural power to bring down spiritual walls i'll repeat that it takes supernatural power to bring down spiritual walls friends there are some walls that simply won't come down with good arguments as important as it is for us to be ready to share our faith but some walls just simply won't come down with good arguments or with good strategy now strategy is really important you have to have a strategy when you're getting ready to share the news of jesus the good news of jesus but sometimes even strategy falls short sometimes you know cool resources won't do the job that you can have the best flyer the the best church invitation that's ever been made the best video the best whatever thank god for awesome resources but sometimes the only thing that will break the stronghold of the enemy is prayer it's when we pray we need the power of the holy spirit to bring down these walls thankfully god you know in his word reveals to us how this is to come about in acts 1 8 back to that scripture again jesus said you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea in samaria and to the ends of the earth notice that jesus command is to reach the immediate people first in jerusalem right and then you go outward from there so i want to leave you with this question who's in your inner circle think of the people closest to you who are far from god in fact let's make it more personal think of one person in your life who is far from god now ask a follow-up question god would you give me an opportunity to share the good news of jesus with that person we're going to pray that right now we're going to ask god to give us that opportunity to share the message and we have to be ready for whatever opposition comes our way we're gonna pray for that person we're gonna ask god for effectiveness we're going to ask god that his spirit would go before us that we would be able to share the message in love let us pray together now heavenly father we thank you that we have your spirit we know about your love we thank you that love multiplies and that your love was able to reach us god we are your children today because someone shared the message with us love multiplied with us god let us keep the chain going god we want to multiply love in other people's lives we want to take the message of jesus we want to take what you've done the transformation you've made in us and we want to share it we want to give it away to others so that others who are far can find freedom they can find restoration they can find peace just like we have god although we know that at the end of the day we're not able to force anyone but god we at least want to make the opportunity available for others to hear for others to be able to make a decision and we know that we're not fighting against flesh and blood enemies we know we're fighting against principalities fighting against things in the unseen world we know the devil doesn't want people to be free so he's going to oppose us god you've called us to tell people about you everywhere that's what we want to do would you empower us today god let your church grow as each and every one of us steps out steps out in your boldness and your authority would you set people free would you bring about new beginnings and the lives of people who are currently hopeless and far from you in jesus name we pray amen well it has been an amazing week i'm so thankful for having this opportunity i pray that these times of prayer have been beneficial to you that they've helped in some way please don't hesitate to reach out to me until next time keep on praying keep on believing and remember jesus promise you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you god bless [Music] you", "that throughout the entire service thank you [Music] tomorrow is a day to remember that the time is always right to do what is right to remember that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere to remember that forgiveness is not an occasional act but a permanent attitude to remember that faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase to remember that our lives begin to end the day that we become silent about the things that matter [Music] to remember that darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that and that hate cannot drive out hate no only love can do that to remember to never succumb to the temptation of bitterness to remember that out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope to remember that we still have a dream all right all right thank you for joining us today you made it out like you're all popsicles i know uh getting in here today that's pretty crazy outside uh thanks for joining us on this martin luther king junior weekend thanks for joining us in revere and online as well today is i believe day eight of our daniel fast we've got 21 days and it's i'm living proof that you can go eight days without caffeine and you still can function as a human okay so there we go uh so if you're joining us on continue to join us if you're not didn't know we were in the daniel fast where you can just join in and just make it an abbreviated version that's fine uh and let's say you started last sunday and you made it until sunday night that's fine as well just start over today it's okay okay we we we'll we'll uh we'll uh forgive you for that so but the point really is not the food the point is really you're praying and the the fast just gives you an opportunity when you're kind of thinking about it instead of just thinking about the food make sure that you spend that time in prayer to reflect on the things that you are asking god to intervene in your life about or to the miracles uh that we are uh that we prayed together for last week uh on the screen that you saw last week as well now we are in the third part and final part of our chapter two series uh we're going into chapter two of our east coast international church history um we've just closed the first chapter chapter one over the past 20 years that god has done amazing and profound things amongst us and we're heading into chapter two right now and so we are really refreshing our vision making sure that we're we're making uh that everybody is on the same page as we move forward so over the last two weeks we've talked about this east coast international church good news for the poor healing for the broken freedom for the captive and today we will continue with the fourth of those and on this martin luther king junior sunday it's appropriate for us to talk about justice and that's not an accident isaiah chapter 61 verse 8 for i the lord love justice somebody say justice i hate robbery and wrongdoing i love justice god loves justice isaiah 58 a little bit before that and we're going to be spending a lot of time in the bible today we're going to be reading a lot of scripture verses that have to do with justice and here's something i want to ask for you to do in this room right now we have people from lots of different backgrounds and perspectives and different scenarios of life and you come to the service today with probably lots of different perspectives on justice whatever those perspectives are i would like you to be willing to let the bible teach you what they should be so i would i would encourage you to say okay this is what i think it is does it line up with what the bible says it is and let's let's try to bring this uh together today for all of us and let's let the the bible do this work today isaiah chapter 58 verse 1 shout with the voice of triumph blast shout aloud don't be timid tell my people israel love their sins yet they act so pious they come to the temple every day and seem delighted to learn about me they act like a righteous nation that would never abandon the laws of its god they asked me to take action on their behalf pretending they want to be near me we have fasted before you they say why aren't you impressed we have been very hard on ourselves and you don't even notice it i will tell you why i respond it's because you are fasting to please yourselves even while you fast you keep oppressing your workers so there we have the first shot they're oppressing their workers they're not treating their workers fairly when god what good is fasting when you keep on fighting and quarreling this kind of fasting will never get you anywhere with me you humble yourselves by going through the motions of penance bowing your heads like reeds bending in the wind you dress in burlap and cover yourselves with ashes is this what you call fasting do you really think this will please the lord no this is the kind of fasting i want so everybody pay attention free those who are wrongly imprisoned lighten the burden of those who work for you let the oppressed go free remove the chains that bind people share somebody say share share we our food with the hungry and give shelter to the homeless give clothes to those who need them and do not hide from relatives who need your help i gotta laugh in the first service too i wasn't i don't know why that's funny maybe it just hits close to home verse 8 then your salvation will come like the dawn of and your wounds will quickly heal your godliness will lead you forward and the glory of the lord will protect you from behind then when you call the lord will answer yes i am here he will quickly reply remove the heavy yoke of oppression stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumors feed the hungry help those in trouble then your light will shine out the darkness and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon the lord will guide you continually giving you water when you are dry and restoring your strength you will be like a well-watered garden like an ever-flowing spring some of you will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities then you will be known as a rebuilder of walls and restorer of homes justice this is not the only place in the bible that talks about justice there's a lot of places that talk about justice but just to summarize just quickly the basics here justice so far loose the chains of injustice set the oppressed free share your food with the hungry provide shelter for the homeless close to those that need them and don't hide from your needy relatives now we have a parallel passage as you find your phone and turn it off we have a parallel passage in zechariah chapter 7 that says this say to all your people and your priest during these 70 years of exile when you fasted and mourn in the summer and in early autumn was it really for me that you were fasting and even now in your holy festivals aren't you eating and drinking just to please yourselves this is what the lord of heaven's armies says judge fairly and show mercy and kindness to one another do not oppress widows orphans foreigners and the poor and do not scheme against each other proverbs so you see that you see the similar themes there proverbs 14 those who oppress the poor insult their maker but helping the poor honors him this is all old testament stuff so let's jump over to the new testament jesus is having a conversation with some pharisees some religious leaders and he's really on them at this moment he's he's saying hey you guys you tithe on everything like the the herbs in your garden like everything you tithe on but you take advantage of other people and that's a problem you should do the first thing but stop doing the second thing luke chapter 20 verse 47 jesus says about them yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public because of this they will be severely punished here we have jesus in the in these in these accounts jesus rebuking the pharisees and then telling the crowd don't be like your own religious leaders whatever you do don't be like them because they exploit the poor and they take advantage of the poor to make wealth for themselves thus creating injustice when you do that so jesus had a lot to do say and do about injustice as well then we have an account with jesus jesus is explaining to the crowd there's going to be this time the end of the age the final judgment and what's going to happen is people are going to be separated into two groups they're going to be separated into two groups the the sheeps and the goats in verse 33 of matthew 25 it says he will place the sheep at his right hand that's the good hand and the goats at his left then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you invited me into your home i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you cared for me i was in prison and you visited me then the righteous ones will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink or a stranger and show you hospitality or naked and give you clothing when did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you and the king will say i tell you the truth when you did it for one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you were doing it for me it's an interesting connection that god is making with the poor there verse 41 then the king will turn to those on the left and say away with you you cursed ones into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons for i was hungry and you didn't feed me i was thirsty and you didn't give me a drink i was a stranger and you didn't invite me into your home i was naked and you didn't give me clothing i was sick and in prison and you didn't visit me then they will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not help you and he will answer i tell you the truth when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters you were refusing to help me and they will go away into eternal punishment and righteous and the righteous will go into eternal life this is an interesting moment because god is jesus is speaking here and he's making it quite clear this group of people that all think they're in the kingdom and he's making it clear you can think you're in the kingdom and actually not be in the kingdom you can think you are in the kingdom but if you don't do justice you're not actually in my kingdom because my kingdom is filled with justice this is critically important in both the old and the new testament we see the critical importance of justice god highlights the poor especially the poor who are not able to climb the ladder of society because that society whichever society it is has a particular set of rules and standards that somehow manage to marginalize or oppress different groups of people and to be clear the scripture does not suggest that we do this it commands that we do it and declares that if you are part of the kingdom of god and unwilling to do these things you are in fact not actually part of god's kingdom that's shocking like god's just laying it down like here's the rule follow the rule or you're not in it's shocking it's also quite compelling because here we have a god who is choosing the poor when all the other gods of the world are not choosing the poor all the other gods of the world choose the elite and the powerful and the wealthy but the god of israel chooses those that nobody else would choose so that's a shocking and compelling argument about justice so that's great but but what is justice what is justice well much of the angst and political struggle in our world is around this very issue of what is justice and it turns out that if you ask a hundred people nobody agrees people don't agree people just simply don't agree about what justice is and because people don't agree about what justice is it creates conflict i do know this i do know that i've never heard anybody say i'm a big fan of injustice everybody thinks they're on the side of justice when our leaders are wrestling with these issues they find themselves not agreeing i think it's very important in these moments to not just rely on whatever the political moment is or whatever the the pop culture moment is but what does the bible say about justice what is what what do we learn from god about justice i've spent a lot of time over the last couple years thinking about this as many of you have as well and asking myself questions like what does god say about justice what does the scripture reveal to us overall and how does jesus show us how to be just these are questions i've been wrestling with over the years we've attempted to direct our church resources and ministries into helping us to be a more just church every year because justice is at the heart of god so what really is justice a tim keller who is a modern christian leader well respected says it like this he says biblical justice is three things equal treatment special concern for the vulnerable and generosity i agree with him on that the bible says at least those three things about justice and that we need to carefully implement them in our lives and so we'll tackle those one at a time let's look at equal treatment for a second if you look at leviticus chapter 24 verse 22 leviticus is a book that lays out the laws there's a whole bunch of standards and laws and regulations in leviticus and it gets to this place and it says this same standard somebody say same standard the same standard applies both to native born israelites and to foreigners living among you i am the lord your god this is a big deal this this statement at a time when the nations of the world only took care of themselves you only take care of yourself your people your tribe your clan your nation that was the most important everybody else is an outsider and has no right to your rules or your regulations or to your your privilege or to your possessions nothing god says something different which is shocking here he's calling his own people the israelites to treat the foreigners with the same standard god calls us to same standard living meaning we pursue equal treatment for all people regardless of their background no matter what that background is we must learn to give equal treatment to all now i've been around a while and i know some of you just did this that's no problem i treat everybody bad that's not what this means that's not what this means if you just generally treat people poorly first you got to get yourself right with god and start treating people properly and then once you figure that out then you got to treat all people equally you cannot look down on any people in any manner in how you treat them you cannot you must have equal treatment then it says and specifically says foreigners this is this is important to us today particularly highlighting what is a foreigner well a foreigner is someone of another race of another culture and most obviously someone from another country this is the biblical mandate for racial and social justice right here it's bible 101 long before we ever began wrestling with this as a nation long before we were born long before our nation even existed god was setting the standards of justice so that the wise and godly could choose to walk in the paths of justice and righteousness unfortunately many have lived in ignorance of these divine mandates or chosen to stay in ignorance or to choose earthly allied allegiances or political alliances and greed over indisputable directives from god equal treatment is a theme through the bible shows up in a lot of places one of the interesting places it shows up is when it talks about no bribes no bribes not no brides that's a different that's a different sermon no bribes and it's odd when it shows up this idea of bribes just keeps popping up in the bible over and over god is not a big fan of bribes no bribing is allowed why why if you're let's say you have a society in that society that's how they get along they just bribe people and that's how the society moves along a lot of societies are like that a lot of cities are like that you bribe people why is this not okay with god because it it brings about injustice and also because poor people can't afford bribes it's not it's pretty obvious if your society is built on bribes and you have money you can get whatever you want and if you are poor you won't be able to get what you need that's so god is trying to protect the poor amos chapter 5 verse 12 says for i know the vast number of your sins and the depth of your rebellions you oppress good people by taking bribes and deprive the poor of justice in the courts once again we have this idea of the theme of equal treatment emerges equal treatment what else is biblical justice besides equal treatment it would also be special concern for the vulnerable in isaiah 58 again going back it says this is the kind of fasting i want free those who are wrongly imprisoned lighten the burden of those who work for you let the oppressed go free remove the chains that bind people share your food with the hungry and give shelter to the homeless give clothes to those who need them and do not hide from relatives who need your help we keep coming back to those themes the bible has at least four vulnerable categories widows orphans foreigners and outcasts outcasts are people that fault come from all different scenarios disabled people uh people with diseases and many much much more widows orphans foreigners and outcasts show up in the bible as a special category there is the standard equal treatment and then there is the exceptions these are the special categories a category of people that god expects his people to have special concern for these are representative of the most vulnerable people in our society widows for example they are highlighted over and over and over again because of the nature of a patriarchal society at the time that essentially left widows in destitute poverty and god wanted to make sure that that did not remain the case for their life or orphans who were seen as having been cursed or inferior or less than or a blight god wanted them to be taken care of along with widows and orphans foreigners and outcasts they all had something similar they were all poor powerless and without platform all of them and we as a people of god are to have special concern for the vulnerable those in these situations in our day today this is god acknowledging that there will always be those that need to be given special concern now sometimes that means care or concern compassion and other times that means advocacy advocacy proverbs 31 says speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves ensure justice for those being crushed you speak up for the poor and helpless and see that they get justice speak up that's advocacy advocacy is not just a social media campaign or a dozen wristbands from your whatever thing you're interested in or advocacy is not just a banner on your profile pic advocacy this means using true advocacy would mean using all of your influence all of your position and whatever your power that you have to get proper treatment for the vulnerable that's what it would mean the other stuff is easy that's hard that takes time that takes money that costs you something which brings us to the next next idea of justice which is generosity or to share your assets the third category of biblical justice in this area is found generosity sorry isaiah chapter 58 verse nine remove the heavy yoke of oppression stop pointing your fingers spreading vicious rumors feed the hungry help those in troubles again we're going back to the same stuff over and over again the theme here is that these acts of justice will frequently cost something there will be a cost there will be a financial cost meaning it will cost you money or things there will be a social cost which means how people perceive you or it perhaps could even cost friends or relationships there will be a time cost because speaking up doesn't take seconds it takes years and there will be a leveraging of your influence cost meaning perhaps your whole life you've been working towards a particular position and you're there and now you have the influence and now god's calling you to leverage that influence towards justice that will cost you something in the book of job chapter 31 job's talking and he says have i refused to help the poor or crush the hopes of widows have i been stingy with my food and refused to share it with orphans no from childhood i have cared for orphans like a father and all my life i have cared for widows whenever i saw the homeless without clothes and the needy with nothing to wear did they not praise me for providing wool clothing to keep them warm job is saying i'm doing these things i'm being just with my stuff there's an underlying principle to all of these genera of these things of generosity and the reason behind it and it's really important that we understand this idea of generosity starting with the reason behind the reason is that we are not to be a people that place our trust in horses or chariots or cars or houses or bank accounts or trust funds these are not the things that we trust these things do not own us they are tools that god gives us to be more just job continued and said have i put my trust in money or felt secure because of my gold is highlighting this fact that the stuff he has isn't the important part making sure that we're trusting in the right place is important that we're not trusting our stuff or our things or our money or our 401ks or our income but that we are trusting god and god alone it's also important because nothing we have is something that we got on our own everybody needs to pay attention to this today if you have something you didn't get it on your own every single good thing that any of us have we are able is only because of the direct grace and goodness of god in our life and only a fool would think that they got it on their own this is a wrestle that we have as a very independent people well i picked myself up by bootstraps and i did this with my own life oh yeah sure you did if it weren't for the grace and goodness of god you wouldn't even have bootstraps the reality is we have a whole bunch of people in this world that don't have bootstraps and we're supposed to help them if i treat my gold as my own and i don't share it that is unacceptable in the kingdom god might say to you if you have wealth that's great you might have done a couple of good things you might have made a couple of good choices and things might have fallen your way but the truth is i'm the one that provided it for you therefore it is unjust not to share the things that i gave you for the purpose of sharing you see god knew god knew that we would be living in a broken world that needed justice so he shared with us he instructed us he commanded us what to do in those situations to be a just people so how can we do justice as a church as a small group as a ministry well it's true we can do justice in all of those areas and we should and we will but those are not enough you see it's so easy to call for justice when somebody else is doing it to call for justice organizationally or systemically or structurally those are all really important and we have to tackle those things but we must make sure that we don't neglect justice as individuals we must do justice in all areas of our life ask ourselves questions like am i authentically living as biblically just in every area of my life with my friends with my family with my work and my shopping in my saving sometimes we can spend way too much time trying to figure out how to do justice when we're actually supposed to be doing justice doing the thing that god has called us to do we don't need 17 committee meetings to figure out how to be just this is why the life example of jesus is so important in these scenarios you see throughout the life of jesus he was constantly living out the principles of justice equal treatment special concern for the vulnerable and he would see to it that justice was done so let's look at jesus one last time before we close as the worship team comes up jesus is my favorite matthew chapter 8 verse 1 large crowds follow jesus as he came down the mountainside suddenly a man with leprosy approached him leprosy this means nobody's supposed to be near him nobody's supposed to touch him everybody's supposed to go away he's not even supposed to come near them suddenly a man with leprosy approached him and knelt before him so the story is supposed to change right there it's supposed to say and the crowds fled and jesus walked away that's what's supposed to happen lord the man said if you are willing you can heal me and make me clean jesus reached out and touched him scandalous he touched him i am willing he said be healed and instantly the leprosy disappeared then jesus said to him now don't miss his part don't tell anyone about this instead go to the priest and let him examine you take along the offering required in the law of moses for those who have been healed of leprosy this will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed two things i want you to see here first off jesus touched the leper in so doing he brought dignity to this man and his humanity a man that probably has not been touched in years or decades by anyone [Music] jesus saw him in this moment by touching him as an equal in need of special concern because of his vulnerability that's justice and then jesus equipped the leper really quickly he spent time with him not a lot of time just enough time to give the leper special information you see the man needed special information to be brought back into society as a full member [Music] and so jesus wanted to make sure that would happen so he gave him the information about how to how to follow the law of moses and to do what he needed to do there's something very important about taking up the cause of justice for an individual while at the same time tackling the larger issues that we face globally or as a nation or as a region or as a city how did jesus respond to oppression this is powerful jesus responded to oppression by coming to earth and identifying with the poor in the oppressed by becoming poor and depressed so he knows now jesus doesn't ask us all to be poor and oppressed but he does expect us all to have equal treatment for all special concern for the vulnerable and to share your assets all of this to bring justice to the oppressed as we wrap up [Music] our chapter two sermon series and really as we open up the first page of chapter 2 in our church history [Music] east coast international church good news for the poor healing for the broken freedom for the captives and justice for the oppressed stand with me [Music] as the worship team closes today ask yourself what can you do what can you do on a micro level as an individual and what can you do as a macro level for the larger things at play [Music] there's lots of stuff we can do start your journey towards justice as the worship team closes i want you to know this is a time to reflect to pray if you'd like to spend some time at the altar in prayer you can let's just takes this time together today", "good morning everyone I just want to make sure you didn't miss it in the announcements because we were probably talking or doing texting or something during the announcements but next Sunday is Christmas okay next Sunday is Christmas morning and we have two Services next weekend we have one on Saturday and one on Sunday uh and so it's the same service and it's designed so that you can decide which one you're going to go to depending on your how your family celebrates Christmas and we have one combined service on Sunday Revere and Lynn at 11 A.M and then we have the one combined on Saturday as well and that's a family service so everybody will be in the room kids adults everybody so come on out for that next weekend just pick which one you're going to now I wanted to give you uh just to follow up with last week we talked about our light for Haiti project we introduced our Christmas offering project this year is this light for Haiti idea and the idea was that for just 35 dollars a piece we can provide light to the people in the remote community of Haiti and prior to this project if you well first off if you're unaware of what's going on in Haiti it's been Decades of natural disasters economic disasters political disasters all now heightened by Warlords taking over power plants it's just it's just a disaster right now and so they're in real trouble and in the remote parts of Haiti it is extremely extremely uh difficult to get by right now and so prior to this project many people would use dangerous and unhealthy lamps that would cause fire or other health issues in their homes and so this light project which involves these portable lights which light up an entire room and they're magnetic so they can stick them on these steel plates that are put in and we also have these light slash battery packs that are solar powered they're a little bit different than what you would buy regularly the more commercial grade and it allows them to be able to charge what they need so it's a very helpful situation for them this is from our on-site Pastor in Haiti the light project is a life-changing tool he writes this elderly lady is very excited to see the big difference take place in her house first she thought it was just a flashlight but after connecting it to the walls she could not believe her eyes she has a two-room house we put a seal plate in each room for her and each one of them light like it was the day she can see everything in her room easily I want to point out to our supporters that they could not do more for the people in this Village finally our people live in the light you cannot imagine how many accidents how many times they hit their feet or head against something just because they don't have a light in a country where gases vary and even too expensive the biggest challenge is that you can't find it easily most of the people in the village go to bed very early at night because they live in a completely dark situation so the light project is very helpful tool to us in the village it's really a life-changing tool thanks to our supporters Pastor Cody so this is an opportunity for us to give to a special project that has absolutely nothing to do with us like we don't it doesn't won't benefit us in any way other than that we are bringing light to another community and so it's an opportunity for you to give and so we ask everybody to think about giving 35 or or more if you like please give through the church Center app in the project called life for Haiti or you can just Market light for Haiti and however other way that you give if you have children this would be a great project for you to do with them to help them figure out how to get 35 dollars to help with this project and for you to explain what's going on in Haiti and for you to pray with your family about this situation it would be an excellent opportunity at Christmas so that it's not just all about us that's the idea there so on the screen right now you'll see a picture of a poor neglected kid with his parents on his cell phones right this is a normative situation now here we have this kid being technologically ignored his parents are just missing the big picture they're literally missing it next thing you know this kid's going to be walking and talking and they won't even notice that it happened well let me ask you this question today have you ever missed something critical in life critical to life critical to relationships because you were focused on the wrong thing or focused on another thing instead maybe even the thing that you were focused on was good or an important thing maybe it was a silly thing maybe it was the best meme of the year that you saw but regardless you were focused on the one thing at the cost of missing a greater thing well the truth is that we all live with the present pressures and current realities of yesterday today and tomorrow morning for example we got to put food on the table there's bills to pay because nothing in this life is for free right and we become so immediately focused on that that we can't see the forest for the trees what that means is the big picture is missed because of the narrow Focus and as a result things get missed important things even Grand Universal things and sometimes it's because when you're going through the fire of life sometimes it is hard to see because you're so focused on the problems it is hard to see that there is actually hope right around the corner that there is hope right there but you can't see it because you're so focused on the problem it's a challenge it's a good thing that we have Christmas here to remind us the hope is on the way the Sci-Fi writer Isaac Asimov tells a story about a rough ocean Crossing during which Mr Jones became terribly seasick at an especially tough time or throwing up over the side a kind Steward patted Jones on the shoulder and said I know sir it seems awful but remember no one ever died of seasickness Mr Jones lifted his green countenance to the stewards concerned face and replied oh please don't say that it's only the wonderful hope of dying that is keeping me alive right now sometimes we feel that way sometimes we feel that way and today we are talking about the hope of Christmas now we are in an interesting moment in history where we get to look back when we read the Bible we're looking back at what took place we're on this side of the cross the people in the story The individuals in the story today were on the other side of the cross they so they they were coming at it differently than we're coming at it you see this side of the Cross we know that Jesus was born lived a perfect and sinless life that he died on a cross for our sins that he resurrected from the dead and gives us an opportunity we are invited into his family we understand that now they did not know that that was all getting ready to happen they didn't see it coming the same way that we know that it did and so Christmas really was a day that hope moved this idea of Hope for the Future Hope moved from a theoretical faith faith-filled exercise that neverly act never actually seemed to happen to a real and present hope that actually had a name and his name was Jesus Yeah Christmas is the day that Christians across the world celebrate the birth of Jesus the Messiah the Savior The Rescuer the King of Kings Emmanuel God With Us that's what it means so that's that's what Christmas is about and it is possible that you're here today and you didn't know that Christmas and Jesus were connected because it's not often talked about anymore so if you didn't know what Christmas is about welcome to the story today there's great hope in Christmas there's power in hope that we all need hope tell your neighbor you need hope you need hope we all need hope there's a there's a study back done many years ago you've probably heard this about a rat in a tub of water and after 45 minutes of Treading Water the rat drowned and then the scientists put another rat in the water and this time the poor rodent neared exhaustion after about 35 minutes and then the scientists rescued rescued the rat the result was that when the same rat was placed back in the water again after a little rest it kicked and swam for hours because it had the hope of being rescued so it didn't give up as easily and hope has a way of doing that for us the promise of better times ahead can help us withstand the toughest of times right now filling us with an energy that we did not even know we had in us because we have hope now but when you have no hope it is much more difficult now the Christians in the first century knew about hope and they understood how this worked from personal experience the early Christians began to suffer persecution actual real persecution under the emperor Nero where they were have they were being killed they were being thrown to Lions all this horrible stuff was happening to them but our faith did not disappear the church endured because those early Believers knew that no matter what happened to them on Earth heaven was in front of them that no matter what happened to them today tomorrow on the other side life would continue and heaven was for them they had real hope and it is something that we don't talk about a lot we don't talk about heaven all the time because it's complicated to get our heads around it but the truth is this Earth this life is not all that there is there's something bigger and further in front of us so when Pastor Peter encouraged them to set their hope uh fully on the grace given to them when Jesus is revealed they took the advice to Heart those early Christians and this is where it comes from in First Peter chapter one he said therefore prepare your minds for Action be self-controlled set your hope where do you put it hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed we have hope in Jesus now as a person today if you trust in Christ you have the same hope that was being talked about here you have the hope of Christ's return that Jesus will come back what that means is this in your life today when you choose to follow Jesus fully and holy no matter what the cost if it costs you your friends your reputation your chances for advancement at your job you have the hope of something far better in front of you the hope of something far better awaiting you and if you're beginning to feel a little bit like the rat in the experiment desperately treading water I would encourage you set your Hope on Jesus Christ set your hope that Jesus was raised from the dead and that gives us assurance that helps us to keep on going that even when we are in deep water for longer than we ever expected there is still a promise of Jesus in front of us that's hope and do you know that that all starts with Christmas that hope all starts with Christmas so let me set the scene for you as we get into the story 450 years the people of Israel had not had real freedom other people had been impressing them the Empire had been impressing them oppressing them they weren't able to govern themselves they were ruled by Persians and then they were ruled by Alexander the Great their faith was being condemned their scriptures were being burned they were treated with disdain and cruelty unjust leaders made the life of the Jewish Nation absolutely miserable and they were desperately looking for a way out of this difficult situation in the year 167 BC a group of Jews revolted against the empire to try to regain some control and this Rebellion continued for years but it didn't actually work they were beat down trodden down by the Roman oppression completely unable to do anything about it like a kid being bullied in school that couldn't defend himself now after hundreds of years of this of not seeming to hear from God as a nation being in captivity and oppression to the Empire suddenly things begin to change it's like the background music of the universe skipped a track it was like you could feel it in the air I wonder if the plants grew Greener and the trees got bigger I wonder all these Earthly temporary problems started to take second place because the sense that hope was on the way was there so let's realize that part of the hope of Christmas is the Hope is on the way now we're going to look at two groups here we're going to look at angels and shepherds today angels and Shepherds and this unusual activity that surrounds the angels and Shepherds so Luke Chapter 2 verses 8 this is the part of the Christmas story it's unusual there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night an angel of the Lord appeared to them in the glory of the Lord Shone around them and they were terrified you could probably keep track of all the unusual things in this story all right you already got a few but the angel said to them do not be afraid I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people today in the town of David a savior has been born to you he is Christ the Lord this will be assigned to you you will find a baby wrapped in Claws and lying in manger now get ready for it suddenly a great company which means a lot thousands a Heavenly Host which is the armies of Heaven the Heavenly armies appeared with the angel praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace to Men on whom his favor rest picture of the scene thousands of angels in front of you that you can see with your eyes singing and dancing like having a praise party into heaven just right in front of you right there that's unusual I've never seen that before I've seen a lot of representations of this I still haven't seen it unbelievable the angels rejoiced they assembled for a celebration they made themselves visible so that the Shepherds could actually see them that is unusual activity most of you have not seen physical Angels reveal themselves in celebration and singing in a thousand uh Angel choir most of you have not seen that some people have had some visions some people are confused but most people have not seen it but very few people have had anything like this happen because in the Bible it's the only account of Angels doing this exact thing and it's because of this if you notice closely in this story throughout all of the accounts of the story angels are involved at lots of different places because this is not just an unusual story this is the only time this will ever happen this is never again to be duplicated it is the only time it is the announcement it is the Fulfillment of the long-awaited child of the ancient Prophecy from Isaiah chapter 7 the Lord himself will give you a sign look the Virgin will conceive a child she will give birth to a son and will call him Emmanuel which means god with us it finally had happened thousands of years have passed it finally had happened that's why the angels are so excited it finally happened it was here it's now it's the the celebration they've been planning for thousands of years I bet it was a pretty good production verse 15. when the Angels had left them now we're on to the Shepherds when the Angels had left them and gone into the heaven that Shepherd said to one another that's some crazy stuff that just happened that that's not what it said it's not what I said at all but I'm pretty sure it's in there we just they didn't record it but let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has told us about they're very contained it sounds like they're just very formal I can't imagine that's really the way it was but but they had hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger when they had seen him they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed and what the Shepherds said to them Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen which were just as they had been told the Shepherds these are like some of my favorite people in the story the shepherd fellows were smart they knew that something unusual had just happened it was unusual activity it's a shame they didn't have Instagram back there right you know what I mean you know I mean I'd be like yeah behind me [Music] Hope was on the way Hope was on the way they knew Hope was on the way because they've just been told by the Angels a lot of them now the Shepherds get this the Shepherds had no context for understanding Angels suddenly showing up by the thousands and singing and celebrating and dancing in the sky in front of them that we don't have context for that either like that just does something that happens to us all the time clearly the Angels were so excited they could not contain themselves the angels singing it proclaiming the Shepherds knew that God was up to something the Angels knew that God's most favored Creation in mankind was about to see the ultimate turnaround Hope was on the way hope is on the way for us today and there's a new thing that was happening so here this really amazing things that thing happens and and my deepest most profound theological moment questions show up to me when I'm reading the scripture and my deep question for this was what happened to the Sheep Shepherds Angels Shepherds mean sheep they're watching over the Sheep it says that it doesn't say what happened to the Sheep I want to know what happened to the Sheep would they pass out do they just pass out did they like get left behind and there's all by themselves wolves attacking them or did they follow the Shepherds to say I have no idea I wish I knew but you know why I don't know what happened to the Sheep foreign because that's not the point of the story that's just some add stuff happening right there not the point of the story shepherding was normal Angels Dancing in the Sky singing not normal announcement of the universe's final and only long-awaited rescuer abnormal Christmas is the story if you wanted to know what it is Christmas is the story of abnormal things occurring of irrational hope being met with miraculous Promises of God being fulfilled that's what Christmas is it's not really about that tree it's not really about the gifts it's not really about the songs oh it's fun it's all fun it's fine it's all fine but what we're talking about is really what it's about it's about this great hope and when people celebrate Christmas without the hope they miss the whole point in 1940s Samuel Beckett an author of playwright wrote a classic play called Waiting for Godot and in the play there's two men that stand on an empty stage just two guys hands in their pocket staring at each other and all they do is stand and stare no action no plot they just stand there waiting for Godot to come down a person does he represent God one Christian ethicist suggests that Godot stands for the pipe dreams that a lot of people hang on to as an escape but whatever as the play ends the men are still standing on the stage doing nothing just waiting now you don't have to pay money to go see that play I just told you everything about the play when the 50th anniversary of that play was celebrated someone asked Beckett now will you tell us who Godot is he answered how should I know Waiting for Godot is a parable of many people's lives empty and meaningless literally just doing time pointless matter of waiting can I tell you that if there is no God of love if there is no God of Grace and wisdom then life really is simply hopeless waiting for empty time to pass but how completely and totally different though is life with the hope of Jesus that not just that he came but that he's coming again you see there's this fancy theological term that we call the Blessed hope in Titus Chapter 2 verse 11 it says for the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people it teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions there's an idea and to live self-controlled upright and godly lives in this present age while we wait for the Blessed hope which is the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us to redeem us all from wickedness and to purify for himself of people that are his very own eager to do what is good what is this all about what it means is this that at Christmas time we not only celebrate the birth of Jesus and his great rescue we are also joining with the Blessed hope that he will return once again and that hope sustains us a hope that is beyond this world you see this isn't all there is it's not just about this no matter how good or bad your life is this really isn't all there is it's a blessed hope that we have in Jesus that we will once one day be on the other side of this life experiencing Indescribable blessing and that hope matters because it sustains Us in the most difficult situations and moments in life as the worship team I'm going to invite back up several years ago there was a millionaire named Eugene Lang unrelated to me um and he asked to speak to a class he was asked to speak to a class of sixth graders from an inner city school he started prepare and think about how we could Inspire these students but then he was talking to them he just finally threw away his notes and he said to this from his heart he said listen stay in school and I'll help pay for your college tuition every one of you that was a turning point for them and for the first time in their lives these students had hope and he actually ended up paying for their college tuition unlike Michael from the office um one of the students said I had something to look forward to something waiting for me it was a golden feeling that nearly 90 percent of that sixth grade class went on to graduate from high school far beyond the normal stat stats of that school people without a hope are people without a future but when hope is restored life is restored and this is especially true for those that come to know Jesus Christ Jesus gives a sure basis for hope he has promised to return to Earth and to take us to our Eternal home until then he has given us the Holy Spirit the spirit of God that is with us the believer experiences a new kind of life right now and we get to anticipate the Fulfillment of this blessed hope when Jesus returns the birth of Jesus Christ signaled to the world the hope is on the way and for us today it signals the hope is always available through Jesus Christ and that the hope of Eternity allows us persevere until we get to that other side the old spiritual says this and I just took out the words I won't sing it says I looked over Jordan and what did I see a band of angels coming after me Jordan was like crossing over if you get to heaven before I do tell all my friends I'm coming there too what is that that is a hope that is a confidence that there is something on the other side and I'm on my way it doesn't matter what happened in this earth it doesn't matter how many challenges it doesn't matter how much drama I have something greater in front of me and that is part of the hope of Christmas it's a great hope that there is more than what we see on this Earth and that in Jesus we always have bright hope for tomorrow thank God for Christmas would you stand with me would you stand with me the worship team is going to close us with this if you would like to just spend some time thanking God for Christmas today let's do it thank God for Jesus and listen if you don't have the hope of Jesus today if you walked in here without the hope of Jesus don't don't get to the other side of Christmas without talking to Jesus about that just in your own words talk to Jesus invite him to forgive you of your sins to lead your life experience the Blessed hope the hope that there is an abundant life here on Earth but even a greater life in front of us thank God for Christmas [Music]", "[Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting you're listening to pastor dave thank you for joining us in the series titled you will receive power we're in day five and today's topic is stay until stay until we're gonna go back to a question we started answering yesterday what is the biggest challenge you face in your prayer life take a moment be honest be transparent be vulnerable well today i want to share with you a story and it's it's a personal story it's a story of my prayer life a challenge that i had to overcome and hopefully it'll help somebody listening today we're talking about challenges in prayer obstacles right and i remember back in college when i first began to explore what it meant to follow jesus on my own i got invited to a prayer meeting with some students and these students would go out every friday night and share the message of jesus with people on the street and before going out every friday night they would spend an hour in prayer i thought how hard could it be i'll join in pray with them but in reality i was really stepping out of my comfort zone i didn't realize this but when i showed up i began to pray and when i say pray i was really just regurgitating things that i've heard before phrases growing up in the church i had identified some phrases that i could repeat and i would just kind of say them but i wasn't really talking to god not on my own i kept on looking up at the clock and you know thinking it was like half an hour had passed and in reality was like five minutes it was super difficult super challenging and i just i kept thinking like what in the world is the clock broken it was a real real challenge for me so fast forward i kept on showing up again and again but something hit me as i as i began to be around these people that actually were praying they were actually talking to god and i realized that all my life i had grown up believing that god is everywhere and you know if god is everywhere we can talk to him anywhere in my room at the church outside of the church on the street we can talk to god anywhere but the truth is when i was alone with god and when i was with people apparently i had a hard time actually talking to god like directing my attention towards god and telling him what was really going on in my life i thought it was kind of stupid like i would be in my room trying to pray and it was so hard and and i would begin to tell god what it is that i was thinking what was on my heart and expressing to him and i would pull back because i would think like why why do i talk to god like what's going to happen i don't know and i just couldn't break through that and then one day i realized that something had to break in my life because i talked to a lot of people all the time i talked to my friends i i talked to my parents and it never seemed that i had a challenge in speaking to other people but when it came to prayer i would start falling asleep i would get interruptions of all kinds you know someone would pop in you know there was always an excuse to push off talking to god i just couldn't bring myself to even open my mouth and then one day i decided that enough is enough i decided today i'm gonna pray and i was literally in a room and i said i'm not coming out of here until i speak to god because this is my heavenly father and if my earthly father my biological dad was here i would talk to him as if he were my friend i could just address him why can't i do that with god and in my own experience this is not something that is for everybody but in in that moment i felt like that was something that the enemy had placed over my life where i wasn't allowed to speak to god and i said i can't have this i'm going to push through the discomfort and i said i'm just gonna begin to pray i'm just gonna say whatever is on my mind to god and i could feel the enemy trying to hold me back and i said no no i'm gonna pray and i just began to tell god what was on my mind whatever it was it didn't matter because i had to break through that i had to push through the discomfort and so that was a major step that i took and from then on i began to practice that a little bit at a time more and more years have passed and thankfully i can look back on that moment now and that was a big breakthrough that i received it didn't seem like a breakthrough at the time because you know nothing apparently supernatural happened but i broke through and i was able to stay whereas before you know as soon as i got the urge to pray i also immediately got the urge to step out and do something else or to turn on the television or to or to just do anything but pray and i never understood that that was a spiritual hindrance now you might have a different type of hindrance but whatever it is i want to encourage you with the words of jesus and we go back to luke 24 49 where he said and now i will send the holy spirit just as my father promised but stay here in the city until oh you can underline that word if you want to in your bible until the holy spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven sometimes we have to stay in that prayer closet until something happens here's the principle that i want to draw from this scripture god is inviting us to go beyond our comfort level god is inviting us to go beyond our comfort level what is your current comfort level when it comes to prayer well god wants to push you beyond that and don't get me wrong here the goal is not for us to torture ourselves okay and thankfully everybody has a different personality there are different ways to pray there are different approaches there are different prayer languages and thankfully nowadays too there are some amazing prayer resources to help us pray and while the goal is not to torture ourselves at the same time the ultimate goal of prayer is also not comfort it is not to be comfortable that's not the ultimate goal and it's also not about how long you pray it's about being transformed in our minds there's even this acronym that i find helpful push which is pray until something happens push and can i just be honest with you sometimes when i'm thinking of prayer like my mind when i come to prayer sometimes it's so jacked up from living in this world that sometimes i feel like i have to pray until something happens within me like something in me needs to change and friends i want to invite you to do that with the word of god to stay in that prayer moment until something within you shifts so as we pray today would you invite god to meet you and would you ask for help we're going to pray together we're going to invite god to help us to stay until to break through the discomfort to to ask him for supernatural power because there may be something that is holding you back that is you know sometimes it's natural sometimes it's supernatural sometimes there's a spiritual barrier that you need to break through because until you face that giant the enemy is always going to hold you back from what god has for you so i'm going to pray with you and we're going to invite god god's going to help us so let us pray heavenly father god we thank you so much um we thank you for jesus god we thank you for the authority that you've given us for your promise god we need the holy spirit god i pray that today you would help us everyone listening here everyone praying along god help us all to push through the discomfort to break through the barrier god so many times we want to pray we really do but there's always something pulling us away if it's not one thing it's another god today empower us to break free from that god let it get to a point where when people talk to us about prayer that it's not causing us anxiety that it's not causing us just an immediate response of discomfort and you know flight no god help us to get excited to to develop a passion for prayer where when we're around other people who love to pray we just feel right at home god help us to develop the discipline help us to understand what you're trying to do through us god we pray for release we pray for freedom we pray for supernatural ability to pray if there's anything natural or spiritual that is holding us back from growing in our prayer life god would you remove it right now would you empower us to overcome to rise above god we know that there's more we know that there's more you have more for us help us to pray until something happens god we want to be transformed we want to be more like you today we pray these things in jesus name amen please join us again tomorrow and until then god bless you [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "all right you should have seen that coming right that was pretty obvious the uh that was you so why are we have we have red chairs up here today it's red chairs Sunday so okay so why are we have red chairs out here today we're talking about our Bible engagement so every month we have a different Bible engagement goal last month was Ephesians 4 insulin Colossians all right I loved that goal that was a great great goal I know right yeah good idea whoever came out yeah that's good good I'm going there this summer those places um the uh what is this month's Bible engagement goal we heard about it a little bit but fill it out for us month of June and in your hand and your handout is a how to access the chosen I mean looks like there's 30 ways there to figure out how to do it in case you couldn't figure it out on your own okay but okay so we're asking people to engage with the Bible by watching a TV show is that all there is to it we're inviting you to read the okay so episode one season one episode one episode two episode three episode four all in the back of this sheet of paper are some Bible uh where they got the story in the Bible from okay and that what we're going to challenge you to do is this read the passage of scripture that it goes along with the episode then watch the episode then go back to the scripture all right so that's that's the goal so that you can see and uh and that's really important otherwise uh you will become a very passive Observer of this and you'll just kind of let it happen as opposed to engage with it so there might be some things you're like hey that's not in the Bible you know that's going to happen every single episode by the way and that's okay um because we don't it doesn't say what's not in the Bible right so so why why did you come up with this goal for this why did we come up with this goal for this month so I've been really impressed with the chosen TV series myself from kind of a 21st century storytelling standpoint so you get a little bit of backstory you can kind of relate to some of the characters you can see a little bit of the why behind some of the interactions that you see in the Bible or an idea that someone had of what a why might have been for that interaction that's informed by historical studying it's really good yeah they did a good job with it um one of the things that is important for us all to pay attention to with the Bible is that much of the Bible is in story form it's presented to us as an exam a story or sometimes we call that history sure right so it's a lesson uh it's a story or history and so it can it can actually be done well in story form if we allow it to be done to influence and help us in in our faith um did you have any comic book or graphic novel Bibles when you were a kid I did get guys some lots of pictures not comic books not a comic book so I had a graphic novel version of the Bible when I was a kid and I as a result I read the Bible almost every day like every night I go to bed reading this graphic novel of the Bible because there's some crazy stuff in the Bible and when you're a kid it's pretty interesting you know Nightmares From that nightmares right nightmares anyways so so as a result of years of seeing the Bible presented in the graphic novel form when I read the Bible I still have images and story things playing out in my head when I read the Bible that kind of and then so much so there's a newer one a newer graphic novel version of the Bible called The Action Bible it's Giant and it's a graphic novel form and I still refer to it quite frequently it's uh it's just a way to help me engage the Bible when I just don't want it to be in black and white right in front of me uh because sometimes my brain gets distracted on on stuff so that's helpful yeah so this is a like a presentation a story right yeah a story of of the Bible and so so is the chosen TV series The Bible [Music] walk that out for us explain that to us so there's a lot in there that writers have kind of manipulated or expounded upon Amplified I mean it's yeah so we can't take it as the Bible definitely not no it's just a tool to help us see the Bible through a fresh lens that's important to know so should I be quoting The Chosen like I quote the Bible no no no no no about the Bible but what if Jesus says it in the chosen no no no no still no definitely no because that's not actually Jesus because it's not actually it's an actor all right so with the screen so when Travis back there quoted the chosen to me or Jesus the other day yeah so that he wasn't actually quoting about oh did I say your name out loud sorry about that yeah so uh so so we're not supposed to like treat it like it's actually the Bible it helps us see it so I'm going to read you a passage of scripture we're going to do this right now John chapter 5 you have the sheet or you should in front of you if not uh raise your hand and somebody can bring it to you Pastor David can bring it to you so John chapter 5 sometime later Jesus went to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals so something I would do is I'd be asking questions where is Jerusalem which Jewish Festival is it verse two now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep gate a pool I don't have any sheep Gates do you have any sheep Gates I'm not actually sure what a sheep gate is in my normal life all right so I would what's a cheap gate which in Aramaic is called Bethesda also what's Aramaic and why is that important and which is surrounded by five covered Colonnades here a great number of disabled people used to lie the blind the lame the paralyzed one who was there had been an invalid for 38 years when Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in that condition for a long time he asked him do you want to get well somebody said do you want to get well do you want to just so you're engaging with the whole thing you're asking questions like why are there a whole bunch of paralyzed people and sick people and invalid people in the same spot next to a pool there's answers to those questions sir the invalid replied I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred while I am trying to get in someone else goes down ahead of me then Jesus said to him get up pick up your mat and walk at once the man was cured he picked up his mat and walked the day on which this took place was a Sabbath so things that you're just asking what is a sheep gate what is this pool of Bethesda why were so many people paralyzed why did Jesus pick this man why was this man waiting for the water to be stirred why did he pick up his why did he need to pick up his mat there's about 80 questions you could ask in this little in this little text so we've read it John chapter 5. now let's watch this representation on the screen of this account shalom me yes shuttle I have a question for you for me I don't have many answers but I'm listening do you want to be healed who are you I'll get to that later but my question remains will you take me to the water look I'm hearing a really bad day you've been having a bad day for a long time so sir I have no one to help me into the water when it's teared up and when I do get close the others stepped down in front of me and so look at me that's not what I asked I'm not asking you about who's helping you who's not helping or who's getting in your way I'm asking about you I've tried [Music] for a long time I know and you don't want false hope again I understand but this poor it has nothing for you it means nothing and you know it but you're still here why don't you don't need this poor you only need me so do you want to be healed so let's go get up pick up your mat and walk [Music] [Laughter] laughs [Music] I'm free to walk like he said don't forget your bed why does this matter because you're not coming back here that life is over Everything Changes now all right all right so so I started watching that when I first came out and um I had like when got like a whole thing at kleenexes right and so I'm running out I just gave up wiping my eyes during this I just weep Uncle my shirts are wet it's just crazy um so it's well done so when Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time he asked him do you want to get well that's what the text says kind of question is that does the man want to get well uh he's he's not been well for 38 years his body's been broken for 38 years at first the question doesn't really seem to make much sense on the surface seriously like asking me if I want to slice a homemade pecan pie or some good Tres Leches or a plate of pastelitos with a bottle of cold Coke made with real sugar you don't ever have to ask me would you like this you can just open up the door put it on my lap you don't have to knock you don't have to say anything it'll just be understood the answer was yes before you asked because asking the question and just wasting time when I could have been savoring these delicious things foreign but as you can guess Jesus because it's Jesus turns out the question is very important here is a man whose body has been broken for 38 years if his whole life is about to change he needs to be part of the decision think about it what skills does he have what's he going to do for work his whole life will be different everything that was normal will no longer be normal everything will be changed the answer is clearly yes but Jesus is honoring and respecting this man's agency his ability to make his choices like he's the one that will have to live with the consequences of this healing but it's still his decision right it's still his his agency his ability to say yes or no to it and that matters and here Jesus is asking him do you want to be well so maybe the question do you want to get well wasn't such a crazy question after all although you still don't have to ask me if I want pastelitos maybe it was a question that pierced to the very center of the man's heart and exposed the motives that lie deep within his Spears his concerns his hopes his dreams and as we do with the scripture we bring it right up to 2023 What About Us as Jesus looks at us today as he looks at us in our broken moments and our broken problems are broken by circumstances or broken by sin what does Jesus say to us could it be that Jesus asked us today the same question he asked of the broken man at the pool do you want to get well do you want to be healed do you want Jesus to heal the parts of your life where you've been damaged or is it easier to Simply hold on to the hurt is it easier to let bitterness fester and and to wallow in the hurt and betrayal licking and liking our wounds all too often we hold on tightly to those things that paralyze us spiritually but Jesus can heal us of those things but when he does we will be left without anything to hide from or hide behind to so we will be fully responsible now for our life choices the ones that we make we no longer able to cry out my life situation isn't my fault and no one and everybody else is to blame so the question isn't really crazy at all it's still relevant to each of us today do you want to get well if you've been crippled by past hurts Jesus asked do you want to be healed if you are chained by secret sin Jesus asks do you want to be loosed if if you are battling addiction Jesus asks do you want to be free if you are the one that still has not invited Christ to lead your life Jesus asks do you want to follow to all of us who need his healing touch in any part or any way in our life Jesus still asks do you want to get well in verse 7 says sir the invalid replied I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred while I am trying to get in someone else goes down ahead of me so there was a ton of superstition in this moment going on and people thought that an angel would come down and stir up the water and then the first person in would get healed or something like that the man did not answer Jesus's question at all Jesus asked him do you want to be well he gave an excuse for why he hadn't been healed yet he says I'm all alone there is no one to help me we we can't help but feel sorry for this man who is alone in the world his family having died or deserted him broken and lonely sir I have no one to help me it's really a tragic cry but it still didn't answer the question do you want to get well and what about us today when Jesus asks do you want to get well what is your response when Jesus asked do you want to be healed from your past hurts do we reply you don't know how bad the hurt really was you don't know what I've been through you don't know the challenges you don't know the pain you don't know the difficulties I've had but that's not what Jesus asks when Jesus asked do you want to be loosed from the chains of secret sin do we counter I just can't control myself again not what he asked when Jesus says to the struggling addict do you want to overcome is the answer I have a disease I can't overcome when Jesus asks do you want to be saved will you say well I'm not nearly as bad as these other people that need to be saved Jesus said to this man do you want to get well and he replied I don't have anyone to put me in it's the wrong answer I just want to scream at the text it's the wrong answer just say yes it's Jesus just say yes yes yes I want to be healed just say yes I in in my life when I watch Jesus ask you do you want to be well I'm screaming inside just say yes because he wants to Jesus shows Mercy though to our friend who gave this this wrong answer or this this revealing emotionally complicated answer he shows Mercy on our friend and thankfully he still shows Mercy to us even when we give the wrong answers Matt he understands the man is probably terrified unsure of who Jesus is is he being messed with life has been cruel is this just another trick can't even dare to get his hopes up but this might be something valid or real so Jesus shows Mercy on him and in verse 8 it says then Jesus said to him get up pick up your mat and walk not a big show not a big spectacle just get up pick up your Mountain walk this is not just anyone Jesus but Jesus is someone who can bring life someone who can bring life to our own withered limbs bring healing to our own damaged emotion bringing strength to our own resolve someone who can say with all authority get up and walk the healing here is a hundred percent from God you know it's the power of the spirit it's the power of Jesus 100 percent but there is a factor of human responsibility here who healed the man at the pool Jesus did but who had to get up and walk the man did who saves us from our sins Jesus does but who must repent and believe we must who cleans us up and gives us the power to live above sin Jesus but who must decide day by day by day to follow him and do what is right we must Jesus came and died on the cross to destroy the works of Satan and to pay the penalty for our sins in scripture we learn that the blood that Jesus shed that day that he spilled out that it somehow spiritually washes us from our sin and its bondage in our life and the fact that he rose from the dead demonstrates his victory over Satan's dominion and death there's a lot going on there and now because of all that we are able to be part of that Victory if we will reach out to Christ reach out to Jesus in faith and we get to reach out to him because he still calls us to get up and walk once you're set free once you encounter Jesus in these moments in all the different forms and ways that he does I'm going to give you a hint you need to still keep on moving it's not a one-and-done situation it's kind of like riding a bike you got to keep on peddling or you will fall off there's like a third of you in the room that just secretly thought yeah but not if you're going down the hill I'm not talking about going down the hill because there's no place in life when you are coasting downhill don't get stuck address one issue and guess what you get to work on the next issue and then you get to work on the next issue and then you get the every time you work on the next issue you realize I got more issues I didn't even know I had this many issues like every time I work out another issue I realize I actually have more issues than I had when I started because you're getting wiser for example in a journey of overcoming addiction so many in the room wrestle with addiction and in a journey of overcoming addiction I want to help you with this overcoming addiction is not your life goal overcoming addiction is getting you to the starting line of life that's true statement it gets you to the beginning line The Starting Line not the finish line so you get to the starting line so you can start doing some work like what I thought I just did all the work you're just getting ready to do the rest of the work with us address one issue then move on to the next issue for example if you have your Merit your marriage is complicated and broken and it's restored or a relationship is reconciled get what guess what you have to do you're back on track but you still have a relationship to grow and develop it just got you back to the starting line you got to keep on moving forward one step one thing at a time one step one thing at a time most of you know I like to go hiking and when I go hiking we do this thing where we stop at the Common Man rest area in New Hampshire on the way to the mountains now we stopped there to get some supplies it's a it's a nice rest area in fact I think it's the nicest rest area in the world you can you can stop there you can like live there if you wanted you can get fresh apple cider donuts you can get pizza that they make really fast that's delicious sweet potato fries I smoked a coffee drinks caramel cheddar popcorns little fudges and chips and candies and it's just a wonderful wonderful place thank you here's the problem it's such a nice rest there the problem is I'm not going on this trip for the rest area I'm going to climb a mountain it's just a play it's not even the starting line yet the rest area is part of the journey but it's it's just there to prepare us to conquer the trails it's not the trail it's not the mountain but it can suck you in it can suck suck you in like hey I made it I arrived making fun of the Teslas in the corner to take an hour to fill up you know their electric thing it's a great place anyhow listen carefully once God puts you on a path of freedom stay on the path and keep moving forward and upward on the path and never mistake the rest areas as your mountaintops being part of a supernatural miracle in your life is a big deal it's fantastic and Powerful but it's not Magic just because God moved in your life does not mean that you now have a cosmic force field around you that brings you automatic fulfillment and victory in all the areas of your life you do have power to overcome power to be victorious but it has to be used has to be used which means you've got to keep on taking the next step please do not listen I've been at this long enough to know people are like let's go you're taking Giant Steps try like oh listen just take some baby steps please just take some baby steps just take one step and then another step and then another step and then another step listen you're going to be doing this for the rest of your life it's okay to take some baby steps and make sure that your eyes are always focused on who you are walking towards you are walking towards Jesus Jesus is your strong tower Jesus is your place of Refuge Jesus is your source of healing and you keep on moving forward towards Jesus we used to play this game when I was a kid in the midwest because there's nothing to do in the midwest except play games that turn out aren't all that fun like walking a straight line in the snow great game I know you got some friends you're like who could make the straightest line in the snow it sounds much less exciting saying it from the stage right now okay really it does and so but when you're a kid you're like you're like I'm gonna make the straightest line ever and you're like okay you're walking you're like I'm gonna make the straight line you're like two three steps in and then what are you gonna do you look back and then you start to lie when you get to the end of the line you have the crookedest line you've ever seen crookedest line in the snow because you kept looking backwards the only way to make a straight line in the snow in this game is to look at the tree straight ahead and not look back even one time well you just keep on walking straight towards that tree because it's the focus it's the goal it's where I'm heading that's why in life we keep focusing forward we keep focusing on Jesus we keep focusing on the Strong Tower our refuge that's where we go not on the past if we took every story in this room in all the difficulties and all the challenges that you've had to overcome to even be here in this room breathing and we heard them all and we listed it all off it would be deeply traumatizing it would be I have a both a privilege and great responsibility to know many of your stories and you know many of the backstories and it's rough I'm going to tell you something if you never learn to stop looking back and instead start looking forward you won't make the steps you want to make we focus forward not back did stuff happen yes it did now let's talk about what's important let's talk about the next step that's how we're going to get there how are we going to take that next step how are you going to lift that foot when you don't want to lift it and get it there how are you going to keep your eyes on Jesus that gets you to where you need to go the worship team comes up I forgot to call them up keep your eyes on the goal keep your eyes on Jesus the psalmist writes this he upholds the cause of the oppressed gives food to the hungry the Lord sets prisoners free the Lord gives sight to the blind the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down the lord loves the righteous the Lord watches over the alien which means immigrant or Foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the Widow but he frustrates the Way of the Wicked this is the kind of God we are focusing on this is the kind of God that we entrust Our Lives to the one who says would you like to get well and he means it and the one who loves it when we say yes could you stand with me as we close [Music] across the room today would you just bow your head and close your eyes just take a moment to respond and reflect [Music] before the worship team leads us in this I want you to know this if God has the power to forgive you he has the power to walk with you and lead you so that you could stay in Freedom so you can stay moving forward [Music] and as you walked in here to date there were some things in your life that may have been broken that you're wrestling with that you're just having a difficult time with I want you to hear Jesus today asking you do you want to be well [Music] and through all of those immediate things that surface and all the reasons why and all the challenges I want you to know that Jesus can still hear your yes even if it's buried in there but make sure you say yes make sure you say yes and invite Jesus to do a miracle in your life today to bring healing to whatever part of your life today that you need it the worship team is going to lead us but let's take some time to pray and invite Jesus into this space the altars are open let's spend some time [Music]", "all right good morning everyone the um let me start off today by saying thank you to John Hinkle for preaching for us last week did a great job thank you John thank you [Applause] this Wednesday we have our annual Christmas party and uh we said we're going to have like lots of like treats a little like a tasty treats what that means is you're bringing tasty treats is what that so we're saying that in faith so bring those tasty treats okay so and don't bring them like at 8 30 when everyone's leaving bring them a little before seven that would be great so uh today we're going to be uh jumping right in Ezekiel chapter 26 tells us something it's one of God's most aggressive and devastating prophetic warnings it's one it's one of the most overwhelmingly devastating warnings in the Bible it's against the king of tire and his people somebody say Tire D so it sounds like you know the things on your car but it's spelled different so t-y-r-e and he warns the people he like brings judgment upon them and what should have happened is this repentance should have ensued they should have been like oh God we're so sorry uh that we repent we're going to turn from our Wicked Ways and go in another direction throughout the Bible this has happened where God will say he's going to do something the people repent and then um uh he relents so had they done so God could have then brought Legions of Heaven's armies to their defense but they did not repent and they uh and the King did not repent and world history tells us that a devastating destruction was brought upon the city of Tire by Nation after Nation after Nation coming in and destroying the city of Tire the region of tire one of the guys that you know is tiglath police are the Third you all probably think about him regularly I know particular police are the third in uh seven in the 730s BC he came in and just wiped the place out Alexander the Great same thing destroyed the region in 320 332 BC and there were several others in between then between that time that devastated that region in history they had Wicked leaders Leading the People into wickedness it was just a really bad scene all around and they paid dearly for centuries centuries more than just one generation centuries and centuries for their ongoing refusal to repent to renounce their sin to recognize their own personal lack of deity what that means is they thought they were their own Gods and we wrestle with this exact thing in the United States when you think of your own God you think you can do whatever you want whenever you want with whoever you want no matter what the cost okay that just means you think you're your own God this refusal ex this refusal to repent Exempted them from the benefits of God's hand to protection and that's really what's going on here is it may look like God's like bringing a a judgment upon a nation but normally what's really happening is that the refusal to repent just means that God can't protect them and his his Angelic armies aren't allowed to come to their defense and the opportunities for abundance peace and prosperity are not there why because God's hand isn't there because we refuse to repent and that's the consequence so remember this Rebel City the city of Tire somebody say Tire again tire and its ultimate destruction okay just remember you got to hold it hold it right over here fast forward now several years several hundred years of time to the time of Jesus Jesus has started his ministry he's preaching and miraculously feeds thousands of people Healing The Sick he's commanded the storm to be still he cast out demons he's walked on water the people from the town where he grew up tried to murder him by throwing him off a cliff he and his close cousin John the Baptist is executed by beheading all this is happening in a really really fast time frame it's been a very powerful season but it's also been an emotionally exhausting spiritually and emotionally exhausting time for Jesus and his disciples they're clearly worn out from the demands of the people in the ministry and he Jesus doesn't want anybody to know where he's going or where he is he just needs some rest and privacy so he takes the fellas and they're on a journey to go have some rest and this is what happens Mark chapter 7 Mark chapter 7. Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of tire whoa whoa hold what we're in Jesus era now several hundred years after all this other stuff I talked about and there that city is again tire and Tire he entered a house and did not want anyone to know it why because he was trying to rest yeah he could not keep his presence Secret in fact as soon as she heard about him a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure Spirit came and fell at his feet the woman was a Greek born in Syrian phenicia phenicia she begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter first let the Jesus's response first let the children eat all they want he told her for it's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs help you understand the children are the people of Israel the bread is Jesus and the dogs is her so that's what's going on Lord she replied even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs then he told her for such a reply you may go the demon has left your daughter she went home and found her child lying on the bed with a demon gone now so Jesus was unable to keep his presence a secret imagine that an unnamed woman seeks him out he delivers her daughter from a demon after a unique verbal exchange it's a little bit complicated but in the in the text it highlights her background her non-jewish background remember Jesus was Jewish and he came first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles her non-jewish background is stressed a gentile a Greek a Canaanite syrophoenician woman entire now let's make sure you understand where we're at on the map on the map on the screen in the middle of the sea is the Sea of Galilee Jesus was on the north side of the sea where the red pin is located when they decided they needed to make a trek up to Tire to find tire you'll have to go north and east I mean north and west so to the left side of the map up at the top now I want you to catch this this is outside the boundary of Israel Jesus is no longer inside uh where Israel is he's now going outside to another Nation to a city in another nation which is not a Jewish Nation it's really important to grasp this and this is not what would have been expected of the Messiah of the long-awaited Messiah of the Jewish people it would not have been expected that he would go hang out with Greeks sour Phoenicians entire that's just not what he would do but that is what Jesus did and it's important to pay attention to this little little nugget right there specifically a city that had been devastated after prophetic warnings from in Ezekiel 26. in verse 25 it says in fact as soon as she heard about him a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure Spirit came and fell at his feet boldly and humbly she approached Jesus she fell at his feet this was not a presumptuous boldness this wasn't like hey Jesus I'm here take care of me now it was a boldness born of humility there was no presumptuousness in this boldness it was a recognition that this was a problem Beyond her control and she was desperately in need of God's intervention the combination of being both bold enough to dare to ask and humble enough to know that she was in the presence of true greatness was a powerful combination because we see her humility when she falls at the feet of Jesus and and begs him to heal her daughter to cast The Demon out of her daughter the reason this is an important distinction is because boldness without humility is simply arrogance and there's a lot of arrogant people out there and sometimes the arrogance can sneak into us so boldness without humility is arrogant so we always have to have the humility this was not an arrogant woman that was this was a broken woman reaching out to Jesus she is hoping with all of her heart that he is who she has heard the rumors about him to be true remember this is not an Israel this is not everybody's seeing everything every day he is way outside of this area she has heard some rumors about a guy it's doing some pretty neat things and she is desperately hoping she's got it right what if it's true what if it's true that this guy cashed demons out what if it's true that he heals the sick what if it's true he's the long-awaited Messiah of the Jewish what if it's true what if it's true and she's bold and humble and she just knows it's true I want to encourage us to follow the example of this woman as she brought her need to Jesus verse 26 says she begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter instead of running from Jesus she ran to Jesus remember again the story where the story's at geographically geography matters in the Bible when you're reading through the Bible or hearing the Bible or listening to somebody talk about the Bible where it takes place is equally as important as what takes place there it it tells you where for a reason Jesus Emmanuel God With Us shows up in the exact spot that Ezekiel prophesies would be destroyed it's been destroyed for centuries tire was ravaged with destruction and rebuilt and destroyed over and over again and now God shows up entire and in her spirit this woman understands this king is no longer coming to this king is not coming to destroy like the other kings came to destroy this king is here to bring peace this king is here to bring healing she understands this somehow God has helped her to understand it she understands he's there to heal and remember the message of Jesus from the very beginning has been repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand or repent for the kingdom of God is here right now in him this woman chose to run to Jesus instead of running away I'm convinced after 31 plus years of pastoring that many people would just rather live with their chaos than turn to Jesus they're just content living a half-life they like got kind of a half-life going on and it's just good enough they don't want to do something great with their life this woman was not content for letting her daughter just slip off her need was desperate and she wanted Jesus to intervene it's also a reminder of this story it's a subtle reminder though that Satan goes after our kids and Satan wants to destroy our kids and maybe never in our nation's history has that been that so that been so evident the enemy is coming after our kids her daughter is demon-possessed maybe maybe you can relate to this woman not that your kids demon-possessed but it may be a good maybe you felt like that from time to time um maybe maybe though you have some kind of significant need in your life A desperate need in your life maybe it's for financial help or Freedom maybe it's relational help or parenting help or medical help or spiritual help maybe it's something deep like deciding what the next major step in your life needs to be maybe you're desperate and you just don't know what to do or maybe you're like it happens to many you get kind of to the end of your rope and you've tried everything and nothing seems to work Reds those are all all of those things are perfect things to bring to Jesus bring your need to Jesus be bold and be humble boldly and humbly bring your need to Jesus like this syrophoenician woman did we don't even know her name James chapter 4 verse 2 says you do not have because you do not ask God I hate that verse because whenever I read I'm like oh yeah that's so simple it's so obvious I haven't even asked talk to God about this yet well ask God first we've been talking about a greater things for the last few weeks in this series and in the past month I just want to just ask you directly like you answer answer to yourself but have you been asking God for anything in the last month with boldness and humility and uh and you're thinking to yourself well there's things that I I should have asked God about but maybe I didn't or ask yourself why why haven't you what's what's the driver behind it how many have simply gone into a situation and it then been the last thing they thought about we don't have because we don't ask and we oftentimes don't ask because we simply lack faith the author of the book of Mark who we're reading is writing to the Gentiles of the area of the era he's passionately and clearly shouting out in as many places as possible that salvation has come to the Gentiles on the basis of their faith not just to the Jews but also to the Gentiles and the Gentile woman is a great example of such faith one of the points of the Book of Mark is that one of the greatest hindrances to Faith is the invisibility of God's power which requires faith for Mark Jesus is the model of Ministry for Ministry for us today you want to know how we're supposed to live our life exactly like Jesus live it like Jesus he's challenging his readers Live Like Jesus act like Jesus bring people to repentance by preaching the kingdom is here Healing The Sick casting out demons each time we behave as Jesus we bring about the further destruction of the kingdom of darkness the kingdom of evil and we advance God's Kingdom now there are reasons why we don't always bring our needs to Jesus sometimes it's arrogance like we can just we can just take we got it we got it sometimes it's nervousness sometimes we feel unworthy sometimes we have no faith like well God can't do that or God won't do that sometimes we load ourselves up with doubt I think this is a common thing in America we load ourselves up with doubt we doubt everything we are so cynical and skeptical we just load ourselves up also we tend to be a self-reliant people and self-reliance is a very high value for us and we don't really want any help we want to figure it out on our own we don't want to have bootstraps handed to us we want to build our own bootstraps like it's us we did it you don't want to need the help that's humility or lack of it sometimes we refuse to see the supernatural around us it happens all the time but yet we say it's not that somebody gets healed well that was just a coincidence part of faith is acknowledging that a miracle is a miracle that's part of faith somebody gets delivered from something and they're like oh yeah they just finally grew up isn't it interesting how they grow up when they met Jesus you know we have to be willing to see it but think about this from a negative Supernatural side okay so there's the positive things they just say well it's a negative thing the Holocaust was a clear work of Satan we recognize that it was evil Cambodian genocide was a clear work of Satan it was Pure Evil a child being abused is evil a woman being beaten is evil a country being led by a murdering dictator is evil cancer ravaging the Bible a body is evil you know we see that it's odd like oh yeah yeah that's you know something else is behind it yet even though there was clear evidence that many of those things are the supernatural works of Satan they are usually dismissed as something less than Supernatural human nature or something unfortunate or even worse sometimes people generically refer to these things as somehow part of God's overarching good and divine plan that's rough in 2012 Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the shooter apologized quotes apologize to the parents and then said it was all part of God's plan so the thing he did was evil and then he doubles down on it it's evil but it if we're paying attention we can see the supernatural evil things why is it so hard for us to embrace the supernatural good things that God does you know there's a wrestling there there's a wrestling Jesus does something interesting in the story he challenges her faith it's not just good enough that she came and bowed down and asked for him to deliver her daughter she doesn't initially get the response she wants Jesus says this hold on so I mess with your understanding of Jesus first let the children eat all they want he told her for it's not right to take children's bread and then toss it to the dogs she's the dog in the story I don't know the last time somebody called you a dog it's probably not a compliment but it's an interesting there's more going on here than it seems in English there it's a little less harsh um in the original language but one of the reasons that Jesus refuses to immediately Grant her request is that he doesn't want to be seen as just a miracle worker he's he's not just your personal Genie in a Bottle Jesus doesn't want only people interested in him for what he can do for them he in fact wants a relationship with them us and wants to be our God not just a genie the power of God in this situation is not released in a context of superstition or Magic well let me just speak to this for a second we live in an exceedingly spiritual moment in history where everybody's a spiritual person or a person of faith I have I still don't know what all this means okay lots of spiritual people out there trying to treat God like he's a big magician they're trying to it's some kind of superstitious magic going on and that and Jesus very much is not interested in that for us he wants to respond to us in response to Faith a faith in him so when Jesus initially refuses her he's actually engaging her inviting her into a dialogue a conversation and he does so to check her faith it's a faith check what he's interested in is a response to his statement she could have just said oh well I'm out must not be for me you might have heard wrong he wants to know how you will respond when you don't get the answer you want and maybe that's important because maybe we need to know what our response is going to be when we don't get the answer we want how will you respond when you don't get the answer you want in faith or not in faith she responds in faith verse 28. one of the greatest sentences in the Bible Lord she replied even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs and if you got a little puppy at home you know what she's talking about her response back is filled with so much humility and faith that Jesus is Amazed by her faith this story is not really about the healing and deliverance of the daughter it's about faith the girl being delivered is almost a side note to the story like oh yeah yeah she got delivered but the real story is about the faith the real point is God responds to Faith because Faith releases God's power when I was a kid I used to spend a lot of time you know out in the woods we have Woods where I was from we would find Creeks or Creeks you call them streams streams and uh we would find a creek and we would play in that thing and you get all wet and when you're 10 years old it's the best you'd find a stream and you would like jam it up and you would make like a little Pond and you would try to make it as big as you could and then it would where it used to be the water flowing it would be dry and then we were all done making this damn we'd like put like a little action figure like a little evil villain figure on the other side and then we'd blow up the dam and oh and it would destroy it would destroy and the barrier that I had created between the soon to be powerful Pond of water and my evil enemies was destroyed and it would rush in like a flood and destroy the enemy that's what it would do that's what the Bible says also we will Rush In Russian it's an illustration of faith we create barriers and obstacles to God and his power we create them all his power is available and accessible but we have too many barriers in the way we have cultural barriers we have social barriers we have pride barriers many people honestly would rather skip a miracle instead of humbling themselves before God the idea of falling at the feet of Jesus boldly and riskily speaking out their faith is an act of humility that is just too great but that's what it takes to boldly and humbly come to Jesus Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 as the worship team comes up without faith it is impossible to please God somebody say impossible without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him now watch this Jesus shows up to rest on the streets of tire in part for rest but also to give the people of tire one more chance to repent and turn from their Wicked Ways they had a chance centuries earlier and they didn't take it Jesus intentionally shows up at Tire to give them one more chance this woman from Tire she's heard about Jesus she finds Jesus she humbles herself before Jesus she believes in Jesus and it sets the tone in the story it sets the tone for the Deliverance of her daughter but she also does one other thing That You Don't See in the Bible what she's also doing is she's blazing a trail for the entire city of time Tire to turn to God she's blazing a trail she's creating an opportunity she's a trailblazer in fact the city of tire would become in history the first city in the region to become a Jesus following City became a Christian City whatever that means it's a it's a profound lesson that when Jesus was amongst the religious people they tried to kill him but when he left his religious friends and went to a city long devastated for centuries he was treated with boldness and humility and faith This Woman's Faith set the tone not just for her daughter but for the entire city to embrace Jesus would you stand with me as we close today here's my challenge for you today first identify the barriers between you and God what are those barriers that you have set up maybe some intentionally maybe some not intentionally but what are the barriers that are set between you and God what is one situation in your life your family that you need to go and humbly talk to Jesus about where you need to go with boldness and humility where you're not afraid to ask where you could exercise your faith even if it's small and just go for it it's part of removing those barriers identifying removing going to Jesus and then the third thing is start today don't wait till tonight don't wait till tomorrow start today one of you just come today talk to Jesus and start taking care of these things today as the worship team leads us the altars are open let's let's spend some time with Jesus today", "in right there at the end see how they did that they snuck that in right there at the end for you the uh I just want to pause and say thank you to the entire volunteer team over at the Loftus Stetson what a great grand opening uh day we had on Friday so thank you thank you the uh that is just a tremendous you know we call it a social Enterprise but it's really a Ministry and uh it's just going to be a great ministry for the city something to the city really needs right now uh and the announcements you heard about a reveal survey that we are doing on your way out of the service on one of the television screens in the back there is a QR code for you to just scan and you can take that survey for us please it's really important that we have at least 100 people take the survey so uh between all of the services we absolutely need people to do that um it would be very very helpful it's cold today outside I noticed that and uh it's going to continue to be cold for a little bit probably I don't think global warming is fully here yet but just so you know we don't cancel church on Sundays because of snow so if you're new here you don't know that but if it snows or like three feet of snow somebody will have slept in the building that night and if you want to walk to church you can come and we will be here somebody will be here for you so just just so you know we don't cancel uh on on Sundays over the past couple of weeks we've uh we saw that a paralyzed man and his friends were commended for their faith for the paralyzed man to be healed and for his sins to be forgiven then we saw last week the daughter of a religious leader named Jairus raised from the dead and an outcast woman be healed and elevated uh as Jesus has called her daughter it's a very important moment and those are some pretty great things that Jesus did we've been learning about greater things like the things that Jesus did things to reflect on we should meditate on these things we should embrace them in our own lives and we need to implement them in our daily Walk With Jesus we don't just see these stories to just say oh that's awesome but that happened a long time ago what are we supposed to do with it right now Jesus said something that I think is really important for us to wrestle with and it's something I'm going to want us to wrestle with for a long time he said in John chapter 4 I tell you the truth anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done hard pause what what say same works I have done Jesus did a lot of stuff healing delivering teaching other unique miracles of nature lots of lots of wild wild things he empowered the powerless it continues and he says and even greater works another hard pause what same Works Greater Works because I'm going to be with the father so because Jesus will not be hands on doing the mission of Jesus we look at your neighbors say we we must continue to do the same work and even greater things than Jesus it's kind of a really mind-blowing statement by Jesus that we'll dig in to an in further in the future but I want to say this it's such a significant passage in Scripture that people have been trying to explain this away for centuries they've been trying to take it out try to make it not mean what it clearly means so we have to think through this very carefully this mind-blowing statement of Jesus and today where we're going with this in our greater things series is I really want us to Think Through how do we prepare ourselves for greater things how do we prepare our hearts our Spirits ourselves our church how do we prepare ourselves to do even more things than Jesus did I'm going to give you a hint to where we're going with this Jesus never started a social Enterprise Jesus never built 24 housing units for homeless young adults never started a homeless shelter that's not what Jesus did we're already at the cusp of doing greater things but that's not all that it meant okay it's not all it meant it meant even more than that and I want us to pay attention to this as we move forward as a church everything comes back to motorcycles in case you didn't know it so my motorcycle yeah my motorcycle has an enemy its name is rust the Chrome on my motorcycle has an enemy this rust thing and if it gets wet and I don't get care of it it begins to rust in certain weak spots and if I don't get rid of that rust right away it starts to make itself at home like it owns the motorcycle and if I don't get rid of it then it can start to do some real damage the rust is Progressive and eventually it becomes deadly to my bike similar to strategies of Satan that are both Progressive and deadly and they prevent us from fulfilling the greater things part of our assignment you see we have an assignment and there are things that can prevent it today we're going to talk about preparing ourselves from the the main thing that prevents us from doing the mission of Jesus in Genesis you have the account of God talking to Cain Genesis 4 God says why are you so angry somebody so angry hold on to that word angry the Lord asks Cain why do you look so dejected you will be accepted if you do what is right but if you refuse to do what is right then watch out sin is crouching at the door just to kind of just imagine what sin would look like crouching okay just crouching at the door eager to control you but you must subdue it and be its master so Satan or sin is always crouching at your door the door of your life looking for an opportunity to cross the threshold of your life okay the threshold across that line now if you don't know what a threshold is if you open up a door there's this moment when you are inside your house in this moment when you're outside your house it's got the magic line that you cross whenever you leave your home that thing that you cross is the threshold and today we're going to be looking at how the enemy can cross that threshold into your life it is my experience that things like anger are intimately connected to this idea of letting Satan cross the threshold of your life and we're going to see some real examples today where Satan is literally crouching at the threshold you see when you begin to follow Jesus when you enter into a whole surrendered relationship with Jesus Christ Satan in that exact moment has no legal authority to have any part of your life he is in essence evicted from your life he has lost all power all control in your life until this is really important until the moment you allow him to cross that threshold back into your life so what's the strategy that Satan uses to sneak back in how does he get back in I think most of us would say we don't want Satan in our life most of it would be like yeah yeah that's a bad idea generally not something I want to do but how is it that we constantly wrestle with this and the number one strategy the main tool of the enemy is simply lies the father because Satan is the father of Lies so when you tell a lie in your life when you tell a lie you're aligning yourself with the father of Lies which is a bad idea so don't do that lies is how the enemy gets in into our life he will try to get us to believe things that are ultimately destructive to ask your neighbor what do you believe what do you mean that and that is the fundamental that is the fundamental challenge in our journey with Jesus is what do we believe you see the threshold I did not even ask for that the the threshold that crosses here is when a lie is believed when the enemy tells us a lie gets into our head tells us a lie and we believe it that's the threshold being crossed here's a dozen of these lies I'm just going to give you a quick Dirty Dozen dirty lies from the enemy lie number one believing that if you acquire more money and more things it will bring you lasting happiness money won't make you happy is that what you're saying pastor Kurt that's exactly what I'm saying but the enemy will tell you all day long if you get more stuff not just money for the shoppers out there Christmas is coming the more stuff you get the more lasting happiness it'll bring you so that's a lie two believing that excessive food or alcohol marijuana can relieve your stress to make you happy that's a lie the second service got the marijuana ad the first service didn't need it but I put it here for the second service of marijuana three believing that an attractive body and personality will get you what you need it's a lie believing that gratifying sexual lust will bring satisfaction lie believing that you can sin and get away without the negative consequences ever people trying to beat this one for centuries it won't get me believing that you need more than what God has given you in Christ believing that you can do whatever you want and no one can touch you believing that you can be entangled with bad company and not be corrupted believing that you can read or see or listen or anything and not be corrupted believing that there are no consequences on Earth for your sin believing that you must gain the approval of certain people in order to be happy believing that you must measure up to certain standards in order to feel good about yourself all of these started with believe these are lies that the enemy crouches at the threshold of your life which is in your thinking he crouches there speaking lies and if you capture one of them and believe it it crosses over so that this is great but how do I know if it's a lie how do I know what's true versus what's a lie very simply we're not going to go in deep but very simply whatever the Bible says is true is true period whatever the Bible says is a lie is a lie it's an oversimplification but it's a radically important and simple thing for us to understand it's not what does my friend think is true it's not what does Instagram think is true it is not what Facebook thinks is true it's not what the politicians think is true it's what the Bible says is true is true yeah so when you reject these lies of the enemy when you reject the crouching Satan when you do not allow him into any area of your life he cannot have access but when you allow him to cross the threshold by believing a lie then he begins to establish this next thing called a foothold Ephesians chapter 4 says in your anger someone said anger second time now second verse that's connected to this idea in your anger do not sin do not let the sun go down while you are still angry and do not give the devil a foothold somebody say foothold boom so we see how we can go from having the devil at the door the threshold to actually cracking the door open allowing him a foothold please don't forget that connection to anger at this stage in the development of Satan's strategy problems in your life that you get from this are generally still manageable your life you can still have some control over and because it's manageable this is the moment where you find two general paths path number one is you ignore it you ignore the foothold because the problem is manageable it just you don't want to deal with it it's fine you can figure it out you know all the lies that you tell yourself marriages do this all the time many marriages do this they think they can manage their problems by avoiding or ignoring or walking on eggshells around each other and just never dealing with the clear issue they create systems or structures and their family that manage the foothold or the sin instead of dealing with it head-on and so what we're really supposed to do is not manage these footholds we're supposed to address the footholds head on allow Christ to defeat the work of the enemy in any area of our life you see we are not a sin management Institution we have a waste management company that comes and picks up our trash okay we don't manage sin that's not what we're supposed to do we're in this sin eradication business that's two very different things we're not here to help you be better at not suffering the consequences of sin that you're doing every day I'll be managing it we're here to help you eradicate the sins in your life through because we are called to let Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit do so so my challenge is don't be content tolerating the things in your life that you should be eradicating in your life that's a challenge long time ago when I was in college we uh we were sitting around playing Penny poker Penny poker this is where you pretend to be playing poker with pennies okay right so that's what that's what you're doing every night every like once a week we'd get together with guys in my dorm and we would be playing Panic poker and after a few times uh we went from like you know three cent bets and five cent bets to like like people started bringing in rolls of pennies so 50 cents 50 cents like okay and then then the next week people brought in like a a coke bottle uh filled with pennies and they had counted how many pennies were in there and so people were bringing Coke bottles of pennies now we're getting some money okay now it's five bucks in pennies uh then the next week somebody brought in a few two liter bottles filled with pennies now we're into like the twenty dollar you know we figured out exactly how much money was in when everything and we're playing and it started to feel a little uncomfortable because now it wasn't just like six cents okay it was it was real money it was happening and then one night you know Ada was playing and it dwindled down and there was two guys left and there was over four hundred dollars in pennies in this in the middle four hundred dollars of pennies and in the room at that exact moment all of us we were all Christians all of us understood we had just crossed a line we somehow it was hard to explain it but we all knew like the spirit was in the room saying stop you're crossing a line right now you cross the line probably a long time ago but now it's really obvious and you know what every one of us at the same time understood that that had happened we ended the game distributed the pennies amongst everybody and we never played again now why because we understood that a foothold was being created a foothold was being created in our life and it become a problem and so we eradicated the problem that's how you deal with a foothold you eradicate the problem in second Corinthians chapter 10 it takes us into another territory it says for though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought I'll read it again take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ and we will be ready to punish Every Act of Disobedience once your obedience is complete now the context of this passage is speaking heavily to the matter of taking captive your thoughts which is a very unique idea because the scripture tells us that our thoughts we are allowed to tell what to do so if you have a thought that's doing the wrong thing or taking you in the wrong direction we are supposed to command our thoughts to get back in line to tell them what to do make them obedient you make your thoughts obedient that means we have a power to control our thoughts to tell our thoughts what to do it's an interesting idea and that's where most of these battles are fought these threshold foothold stronghold battles start right there in those places around your thinking in the Old Testament there's a stuff called high places these these high places are places where the people would set up altars to worship false gods so they would go they would go to these false god high places and it was very problematic because this is not what they were supposed to be doing interestingly enough even when in Israel and Judah they would have good kings that would bring on spiritual reform to the nation many times the Bible records that even the good Kings would not remove all of the high places and those high places became strongholds for the spiritual enemy of their life and Nation to wreck the household of faith so here's how this plays out when you believe the lies and thresholds are crossed and when you ignore the footholds instead of dealing with them head on and you when you permit the strongholds you create a life scenario that is simply a life of survival instead of thriving the goal for your life is not to survive the goal for our life is to thrive to have the Abundant Life that Jesus offers so if you find yourself today in survival mode it's a warning it's a huge warning we have to move from surviving to thriving 20 years ago uh our church purchased a property over on Chestnut Street we referred to it as the Ministry Center and we used it as such for nearly a decade and for the old timers around you'll remember you used to have staff housing there small groups food pantry Counseling Center different programs during the morning the afternoon the evening six days a week we had homeless young adult housing there for a while we did below Market rental housing and much more we have used that building effectively for 20 years this past Monday we were able to officially sell that property and to pay off the rest of our 884 000 mortgage we had on all five of our properties [Music] what that what that means is that as of Monday East Coast International Church has absolutely no debt whatsoever and and there's always ends right and we are now positioned to try and purchase another property here in the downtown area closer to the church when we walked into that place that Ministry Center when we walked into that place we had to do a lot of renovations in fact when I took the early leadership team into the building I said just don't look at anything just don't look at anything it'll be fine a major reason was because Chestnut Street had become a cockroach mansion a cockroach stronghold so to speak let me tell you how much I'm not talking about two or three cockroaches I'm not talking about a dozen cockroaches I'm not talking about you walk in and cockroaches scatter when you turn on the lights no no no no these cockroaches were not afraid of the light I'm talking about you could see the wallpaper moving on every wall because the Cockroaches were underneath eating the glue in the wallpaper true story I'm talking you would go into the kitchen area and there were cockroaches moving in and out of the refrigerator and freezer like it was just a habitat for them the sinks and faucets cockroaches were coming out of this is not an exaggeration the uh the cabinets did not have cockroaches inside of them like the oh when you open it the Cockroaches were in the wood going through the wood going through the wood like when I say infestation like all the Cockroaches and land lived in this building and then went out to every area each morning it was insane oh my God I I am not I'm not exaggerating this at all when I say tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of cockroaches that is a true statement it took when we had it um when we had the uh the guy come in to kill all the Cockroaches you know it takes it takes a couple of weeks to do this when it's this bad every day we come in and we would sweep up garbage bags of dead cockroaches every day for two weeks this was insane so so what do you do when you have a situation in your life or a stronghold has been established a cockroach strong if it helps you to overcome sin think of it as a cockroach stronghold okay that can work you either live with the Cockroaches which the previous tenants had done or you get rid of the Cockroaches what do you decide to do yeah so friends when a stronghold emerges in your life stop living with it and start eradicating it just just destroy it in your life like no mercy no mercy it's time for eradication okay back in 1999 there there's this set of awards called the Darwin Awards the Darwin Awards are are given to people that do really dumb things okay back in 1999 the guy that came in second place for this award it was a Vermont native named Ronald demuth he found himself in a rather difficult position one day while touring Eagle Rock African safari zoo with a group of of thespians from Saint Petersburg Russia Mr demuth went overboard to show them one of America's many Marvels he demonstrated the effectiveness of crazy glue the hard way apparently Mr demuth wanted to demonstrate just how good the adhesive was so we covered the palms of his hands with the adhesive and jokingly placed them on the rear end of a passing rhino the Rhino was a resident of the zoo for the past 13 years he was not and Rhino was not initially startled as it had been part of a petting exhibit since its arrival as a baby however once it became aware of its being involuntarily stuck to Mr demuth it began to panic and run around the petting area wildly Making Mr demuth an unintended passenger Sally the rhino also hasn't been feeling well lately she has been constipated we had just given her a laxative and some depressants to relax her bowels when Mr demuth played this juvenile prank said James Douglas caretaker during Sally's tirade two fences were destroyed a shed wall was gored a number of small animals escaped and during the Stampede three pygmy goats and one dunk one duck were stomped to death as for the move it took a team of Medics and Zoo caretakers to remove his hands from her buttocks first the animal had to be captured and calmed down however during the process the laxatives began to take hold and Mr demuth was was reportedly showered with over 30 gallons of rhino diarrhea [Music] I couldn't wait to tell this story yeah it was tricky we had to calm her down while at the same time Shield our faces from being pelted with rhino dung I guess you could say that Mr demuth was into it up to his neck once she was under control we had three people with shovels working to keep an air passage open for Mr demuth we were able to tranquilize her and apply a solvent to remove his hands from her rear said Douglas I don't think he'll be playing with crazy glue for a while now some of you have no idea what the sermon about is is about anymore I know here's the point have you ever indulged in being ticked off for a moment and then remained angry have you ever spent a week trying to plot Revenge have you ever knowingly gone to a place where you knew you were probably going to get in trouble or do something you weren't proud of and then it ended up being a lifestyle have you ever known a good thing to do and chose not to do it have you ever in other words stuck your hand to a rhino's butt I think most people can identify with how anger and unforgiveness can get a stronghold in our life that you struggle to break free from if you've ever been cheated on or abandoned or neglected or something important was stolen from you unforgiveness and bitterness can begin to settle in and this is what's happening it's like the spiritual version of sticking yourself to a rhino's butt and we can clearly see that it's not something we want it's not something that's beneficial for us to do as a worship team comes up of course that applies to somebody opening up our lives if it's to drugs or pornography or gambling or anger or a myriad of other things it's like super glue on your hands to slap a rhino because these things are like opening the door to the enemy to invite trouble heartache potential for Life controlling problems I think the Old Testament example of allowing high places is an example of how some people that begin to follow Jesus that allow high places to return to remain in their lives even those that have been following Christ for many years and have repented oftentimes still have that that one thing that one sin that one challenge that one life-controlling problem that so easily besets them it becomes a stronghold it's a stronghold in your life so around here we believe in something called Deliverance and do people need Deliverance of course absolutely but people also need discipline discipline to remain free in most cases it begins with now watch this it begins with tearing down strongholds or footholds throwing out the stuff making strategic decisions ending unhealthy relationships and then shutting the door and keeping it shut why because sin is always crouching at the door that's why at Sunday school I used to sing Shut the Door Keep Out the Devil [Music] people want to be delivered in five minutes at the altar and that's great but then when I get up go live like the Devil Without discipline for the rest of the week here's what we need to understand being free is a combination of the dynamic Healing Touch of Jesus as well as the disciplined life of following Christ daily you can't really have one without the other they come together and we want both for everyone I'm calling each and every person in this church to a place of deep spiritual analysis I want you to identify each and every area of your life that is not right with God and intentionally tear down the strongholds and footholds of sin in your life or your family or your marriage or your business or whatever it is because of this I want you to know friends that we are in the beginning stages right now of Watching God rebuild this church as we're coming out of the pandemic the last you know the first few months was pretty complicated as we came out of the pandemic and things have turned to corner and we're moving in a very different and Speedy Direction God is doing something special and we are praying for a continued steady outpouring of the Holy Spirit In God's favor upon this church but when this happens it is imperative that everybody prepares themself for greater things that you deal with the threshold the foothold and the stronghold issues in your life because we're God changes lives the enemy is right behind trying to take advantage of any undealt sin on sins that haven't been dealt with and I want us all to be able to participate with this together I don't want to see casualties of War so today if your hand is stuck on a rhino's butt then it's time to take care of business disentangle yourself be rid of the sin that so easily entangles you Revere I hope that translated well by the way revered online is so all right why don't you stand with me today would you stand with me today Ramsay the worship team is going to close us with this song and as they do go ahead and start doing this work right now the altar is open spend some time in prayer wherever either at the altar or wherever you're at spend some time in prayer talking to God about these things what is the stronghold what is the foothold what are the threshold issues right now and just go to work with this right now", "thank you everybody the uh today in our Justice Conference um we we have so many directions that we could go we're not going to go in every direction today but we are going to tackle some things direct and head on and Bishop Harvey is going to help us do that for those of you that don't know who Bishop Harvey is which is probably most of you at this point the uh but he will become a dear friend of yours very very soon uh Bishop Harvey uh pastored in Milwaukee Wisconsin Wisconsin is close to my heart since I was born there but the uh so Milwaukee Wisconsin for many years he's the president of our movement's national black Fellowship but he is also now one of our executive presbyters what that means is that uh everything wrong with our movement is his fault at this point that's what that means so so um he's only been there a brief a short period of time and uh he is uh what that means so you understand that he is one of our overseers ultimately he's a little he's one of my overseers and uh that that's very very important for you to understand as he comes and shares with us today so we didn't just like find some random person to talk about this okay um so we have much to learn much to grow from this is in the context of our movement our family our team our tribe this is uh this is really important stuff for us to tackle here today and we've been on this journey as a church and for those of you that have been around for a few years you understand that this journey has not been easy it has been complicated and we are still moving forward in this this is what we've been called to do preach good news to the poor feeling for the broken Justice freedom for the captive and justice for the oppressed and we need to be front and center on this because if we don't do justice nobody in our city will do justice we do justice so that our city can have justice so our cities can have justice so why don't you welcome Bishop Harvey as he comes and shares today foreign [Applause] thank you well I was his friend until he said all the problems are mine I was tracking with you but Jen straightened it out and said I didn't I didn't create them they're mine right I'm I'm there to fix them yeah not my fault but I'm there to fix them wow it's so great to be here I really feel and I don't I'm not flattering you all but I feel like I'm I'm home that I found a family I found a tribe I love being around real people I have a problem with religious people so if that's you you know I probably won't be talking to you at lunch today all right I'm gonna be looking for some real folks you know some people who are ex you know because I'm an ex a whole lot of stuff I'm not here to share my testimony but you know you know we got a lot of exes I used to be but I'm not anymore by God's grace I mean God uses those people right if you think about Peter right he was he would cuss you out and cut your ear off and and one stroke you know Moses was a murderer Rahab was a a harlot I was going to say something else from the streets but you know God just he just takes those kind of people and redeems them and uh and we're all just a testimony of that so can we just give God praise for what he's doing and what he's done Pastor Kurt thank you Jen thank you for being here thanks for the hospitality I've received already um I want to tell you all the story so Pastor Tanisha yelled out the word justice today and that's what we're here to talk about um a story about mercy and justice the Bible tells us in Psalm 89 verse 14 that Justice is the foundation of God's Throne this is a powerful scripture Justice is the foundation of God's throne and mercy and Truth they reside with him and so mercy and Justice one day we're playing by the Riverside and uh all of a sudden they heard this Splash and this man was floating down the river just trying to you know just breathe he was drowning and so Mercy jumped in and ran swam towards the man struggled but pulled a man out of the water got them on the side of the of the of the shore by that time Justice came over and they were just trying to help resuscitate the man then they heard another splash another man was in the water and he's now floating down the river stream and he's panting trying to get his breath and trying to survive and this time mercy and Justice they both leave this man and they jump into the water swim pull the man ashore pull him on the bank and try to revive him bring him back to life and would you know there's another splash and a third man is in that same river stream and he's drowning in Mercy jumps in starts swimming turns around and looks and all he sees is Justice's back because Justice is running away from Mercy at that time and mercy says Hey Justice where are you going I need you justice says I'm going Upstream to find out who's throwing these people in the water that's a picture of Justice that's Justice does something yeah Justice seeks to identify the root problem and fix it to correct the wrongs and I want to let you know that justice has a name and his name is Jesus Justice is not a political term it's not a sociological term Justice is Jesus Justice is Jesus's idea it comes from him it's the foundation of his throne and he is all about bringing restoration and fixing broken things and I love what Pastor Kurt says I know the foundation of this church is born out of Isaiah 61 that the spirit of The Sovereign God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to Proclaim good news to the poor that's what Justice does it brings good news to the poor what's good good news to the poor you don't have to be poor no more right justice has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim freedom for the captives release those from Darkness who are prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all who mourn to provide for those who grieve in Zion to bestow upon a crown of beauty instead of Ashes the oil of Joy instead of mourning and a Garment of Praise instead of the spirit of see that's Justice fixing something that's wrong it's it's putting things in order that are missing and that's good news Jesus is justice Michael 6 and 8 tells us that this is what God requires of us it's really simple we've we've kind of made being a follower of Jesus Christ so complex and it's really simple the Old Testament says it's this act justly love Mercy walk humbly with your God go ahead and do that in the New Testament he says love God with all your heart mind soul and strength vertical horizontal love your neighbor as you love yourself do these two things you fulfill the whole law Old Testament and New Testament boom right there you want to know how to be a follower of Christ memorize those two scriptures go ahead and do them you're on your way to heaven and you're taking a whole lot of people with you and you're going to bring Heaven on Earth you're going to bring Justice wherever you go but when we when we look at these two concepts when we look at Justice we find ourselves in a conundrum right now in society where political pundits and cultural critics have just hijacked what it means to practice Justice to do justice to love our neighbor as we love ourselves and what we find is that they're pitting us against one another and they're trying to make us choose are you social justice or biblical Justice are you know which side are you on because if your social justice you're just giving the person uh a sandwich to eat and you're not giving them Jesus but if you're biblical Justice You're just you know concerned about their soul and whether or not they go to heaven but you're not meeting the needs of the people so which one are you I reject that premise I believe that God is telling us that that we are to do justice love Mercy walk humbly with our God love him love our neighbor it's all of the above it's it's not one or the other it's both ad Justice is Justice whatever adjective you put in front of it justice is the noun all right Justice is the verb Justice is what we are called to do I want to give thee give you that definition let you know it's upon that Foundation that I'm I'm teaching from uh today I also want to let you know that I need your prayers I need your help I was sharing with uh with Pastor Kurt and staff recently I said hey I'm not an expert in uh Injustice I'm not an expert in this topic um but I do pray that and ask your prayers for what Isaiah 50 and 4 declares the Lord has given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who was weary he awakens me morning by morning he awakens my ear to hear as the learned so my aim today is not to stand before you as a expert who's you know flew in from Milwaukee and I'm going to just make things right and Lynn and you're never going to you know need Pastor Kurt to teach you another message because you have heard it all from Bishop Walter Harvey no that's not true if I succeed today I'll be two things for you I'll be a counselor and I'll be a teacher those of you that have been to a counselor before counselors don't always just give you advice and five keys go ahead and do this take these three steps and poof you won't need me again counselors they listen counselors ask a lot of questions and counselors bring the answers to your problems out of you right and so uh I'm not here I don't know the city of Lynn I don't know the Greater Boston area you do you know the problems and the solutions are here by the grace of God and so I want to be a counselor but I also want to be a good teacher uh talking to my new friend Nixon who's a teacher uh and uh and there may be other teachers here today but you know teachers are different than gurus right gurus are experts gurus they got a podcast they got a website they gotta you know they got flyers and brochures I I ain't talking about nobody I'm just talking so if that's you just keep looking at me and nobody will know all right but gurus they've got five steps ten keys right do these three things gurus are experts but but teachers are different and mark wolin is a is a great author he wrote a book called it didn't just start with you and the foundation of the book is making us aware of trauma in our lives and know that the trauma that we're experiencing it didn't just start with us many times it's generational it's stuff that we inherited and he says this about the difference between gurus he says gurus give us themselves and then they give us a system so when they give us themselves they're giving us their personality they're giving us their Charisma you know they're giving us their brochures and cards and their bio and then they give us a system and people pay hundreds of dollars for gurus but teachers are different teachers present a truth and then they leave you to yourself so pray for me that I'll be a good teacher and a good counselor today it didn't just start with you when we talk about the issue of of race and and Prejudice and bias and and and and Justice as the foundation we have to do it in the I believe in the context of our family history his family is our story we cannot divorce ourselves from history we can't and and we're seeing that happen in the cultural and the political realm today where you know uh certain theories are being attacked that's trying to really strip us from our history strip us from uh from things that we've inherited they're in the world today so we cannot expunge from the inside of us family in history Peter schizero who's a wonderful pastor and author and teacher from Queens New York wrote numerous books on the topic of emotionally healthy spirituality he he reiterates this point and he says Jesus might be in your heart but Grandpa's in your bones you can't take your background out of you you are who you are because of other folks who came before you and they're in you too yeah when you get married you married mama daddy grandma grandpa uh Aunt June you know Uncle Uncle Leroy all of that they're in you we're gonna we're gonna take a deeper Journey today also into culture because when we understand our inheritance we have to look back but we also have to look out and we have to understand culture now culture is what we do right it's our it's our the food we eat it's the the music that we listen to It's the you know it's it's it's the art that we create it's the clothes that we wear it's it's the Traditions that we have for the holidays uh it's a language it's manner all of that is culture it's our way of life it's how we do stuff and I want to just give you this truth and then leave it to yourself white culture does not set the standard for anything not for beauty not for intellect it doesn't set the standard for excellence doesn't set the standard for uh what is the Utopia of religious expression but it is a dominant culture in America it's not the only one I I like vanilla ice cream with some hot apple pie but I can't eat vanilla ice cream all all the time sometimes I might want some chocolate or some you know Neapolitan where you get the vanilla the chocolate and the strawberry sometimes I might just want some chunky monkey all right don't judge me right I like the chocolate with the banana and the mint chocolate chip those two I mean sometimes you might want some sprinkles some nuts some caramel some chocolate maybe a cherry on top and I believe that's how God created us to understand that culture is important but we have to just reject the myth and the notion that dominant white culture is the standard but that's what we have that's what we've grown up in in America right if you've been in America more than two weeks you've already ingested you've already ingested in your lungs and you have become racialized because the foundation of our nation is race we're going to go deeper and talk about that um my journey I don't know if you all know this but I'm black I don't know if you knew that I used to have a radio broadcast back in Milwaukee when I was a senior pastoring it was called light for today and it was on for about 20 years it would come on Sunday morning it would come on weekday and it was just excerpt excerpts of my sermon that were kind of edited and uh I met a person uh in the in the grocery store one day and uh and we were talking about you know Jesus and the Bible and and uh and I said hey yeah I'm Walter Harvey said you're Walter Harvey I listened to him on the radio you're not him he's a white man they had never met me before but they heard me on the radio and they said this guy must be white so I never really listened to myself and know what white sounds like but they thought I was white but I'll tell you the day I discovered I was black I discovered I was black when I was a freshman at Marquette University in Milwaukee and I was sitting in the front row kind of where Pastor Kurt is uh in the theology class Old Testament Theology and all the students behind me were white and there was a black female sitting next to me on the right where uh Jen is sitting and the the professor was a Jewish rabbi and he made a statement and he said uh Jesus was probably darker than you and he pointed at me that's the day I discovered I was black and my first emotion was one of embarrassment and I was like man everybody knows I'm black and I would have slid down under the seat but I was already in the front row I couldn't go anywhere but that emotion of embarrassment quickly turned to a curiosity which led to a pride not just in my ethnicity but also in the grace of God because it was then that I discovered that I was in the heart and the mind of God as a black man long before I came to this class that there was a history that I participated in in Theology and in Old Testament in the New Testament in the genealogy of Jesus and in history and so it opened up New Horizons for me uh I have many multi-ethnic friends including a lot of white Pastors in Milwaukee uh and I asked my white friends this question remember a teacher gives you truth and leaves you to yourself I said to my white friend pastor Matt Erickson I said Matt when did you discover you were white you've never been asked that question before and you probably never heard that question when did you discover you were white he thought about it he said you know what the day that I walked into a department store with my two African adopted children and they walked in in front of me and immediately the security guard started following them but didn't pay any attention to me that's the day I discovered I was white I asked him another question I said what do you like about being white foreign he didn't have an answer because whiteness as is a myth somebody's really white nobody's really black and even though we use those terms to kind of categorize you know white is you know this is white and this is black but we use that to kind of categorize ourselves he asked me the question what do you like about being black I said oh that's easy man I love you know Motown come on you gotta have Stevie and Smokey and man what would the world be without Motown it'd be vanilla ice cream right just every day just Nashville country and western yes you know pop then BG's yes you gotta have some Motown [Laughter] I say man I love the soul food I love the swag I love y'all I'm married now now I'm not lusting but I love the curves that black women have I'm telling you black women got some curves and some of my white sisters y'all know what I'm talking about right they go out and they they invest in themselves to get some curves I asked a question of Hispanic people they they can answer it the same way and I love I love the way we dance and I love you know I love our swag I love our food you know but when when white people give up their ethnicity for the sake of the privilege of being white you also give up culture you give up so much stuff that I pray that God would help us open up our eyes to see how that there really is One race and it's the human race that God didn't make race he made ethnicity from one man and when you think about it that that first man named Adam one of the ancient definitions of the name Adam is Red Man Red Dirt my daddy was from Georgia mama was from Mississippi every time we go back down south you know black people go south white people go north it's a reason for that the Great Migration black people left the south in the in the 1910s up until about 1960 trying to escape the oppression of Jim Crow and and mass lynching and just blatant overt discrimination and so they came to the north seeking better opportunities uh but when I go down south I see that red dirt first time I went to Africa man I got off the plane and I saw people who look like me and majority I was like I'm home I kneel down and kissed the dirt but it's red brownish dirt and I thought man God you made man from the dust of the ground he didn't make them from Sand I'm just giving you truth and leaving you to yourself you know what the color of sand is right man from the dirt breathe into the breath of life and it became a living Soul God made One race it's the human race and so we need we need to embrace this truth that regardless of where your ancestry lies it may be in the Indigenous native tribal people of this land City wasn't always call Lynn it was probably called by the name of the tribe that was here long before Christopher Columbus got lost I mean before he discovered of America it was long before he discovered America right there were some tribal people here and so you may have ended up here that way or you may have been part of that enslaved uh group of people that came on that transatlantic Journey from Africa to the Caribbean to uh islands and eventually to what we now call America or your ancestry might have come from the European continent across the Atlantic where the the Lady Liberty greeted you at New York Harbor come on welcome give me your tire give me your huddled masses yearning to breathe fear holding up that torch of Liberty saying welcome to the land of opportunity where you can fulfill the American dream your ancestors may have come from the Canadian border they may have come across the southern border from Mexico or they may have come from across the Pacific from an Asian Island however your ancestry got you here Santa Maria uh Penta whatever ship it was we're in the same ship now amen we're in the same ship now and if you believe in Jesus you're my brother you're my sister I'm your brother from another mother you're my sister from another mister right it's the blood of Jesus Christ that has made us common and we need each other we're in this thing together and we are better together Ecclesiastes 3 tells us that two are better than one we need each other I love to watch Marvel Comics right the Marvel and the Marvel series and you know when I was growing up you know my hero was Thor blonde hair Swedish you know European I mean there were no black Marvel Comics they might have been villains but they weren't like the heroes you know but when Black Panther came I can't wait till November 11th y'all I'm just going to wakanda forever I just can't right and it's coming back I can't wait but when the Black Panther camera's like man we finally got a black superhero but notice the thing about these these Marvel heroes they all have individual powers and abilities you know Spider-Man you know Thor with the hammer Wonder Woman with the last Souls you know Superman you know can fly Batman with all of his utility belt but all by themselves they get beat up by whatever the villain is is trying to overtake the globe but when they come together with all of their unique differences that's a picture of the body of Christ that's a picture of humanity and all of our differences coming together how God can bring about his Divine Vision a global local vision of Justice I call it glocal Global and local God's dream God's vision is one of Justice and the truth is you know this better than I do that Greater Boston has had numerous opportunities in the past and even in the present to demonstrate Justice to demonstrate it in a way that's powerful in a way that's practical and in a way that's perceptible in other words those who are poor those who are blind those who are incarcerated those who are mourning those who are captive can experience in perceptible ways it makes a difference for them Boston a city of first right it's it's a city that was the the epicenter for the Abolitionist Movement it's a city where Frederick Douglass uh once called home Lynn a city he called once called home right Pastor was telling me that his first book was written while he was here a city of Champions a city where the first African-American basketball player Chuck Cooper played 1950s for the Boston Celtics and then of course you know the great Bill Russell with 11 Rings people often talk about Michael Jordan and LeBron you know who's the greatest I say Bill Russell I said he's the one that got 11 rings right you put LeBron and Michael together they still don't have 11. oh a city of first but it's also a city a region with challenges you know those challenges better than I do uh but there was a time where Irish were not considered white right there there was there was there were caricatures of the Irish you know based on Protestant and Catholic history in fact uh One Source says that that the English let me let me let me get this right it's talking about the categorization and the history of race that in the late 16th century until the 18th 18th century that the English had a long history of separating themselves from others and treating foreigners such as Iris as aliens by the 17th century their policies and their practices in Ireland had led to an image of the Irish as Savages who were incapable of being civilized proposals to conquer the Irish and take over the land and use them as forced labor failed because of Irish resistance Irish folk loved the fight man that's a that's a stereotype but I know some of them do it they weren't going to be enslaved they were not going to be colonized and so it was then that many Englishmen turned their idea of colonization of the new world they turned to the the idea of colonization and their attitudes towards Iris set the Precedence for how to treat Native Indians Native Americans indigenous people and later Africans I was talking to my my friend Tony he was talking about the North Boston area and the and the South Boston area Italians on the North and Irish on the south you all know that history better than I do but it's unjust it's important to understand how we got to where we are today in order to determine a path for us going forward there's a legacy here uh there's uh there's there's a history and a reality that race has become weaponized I don't know if you remember maybe two years ago during the pandemic that an African-American man was bird watching in Central Park in New York minding his own business and a white woman was walking her dog actually choking her dog on the leash you know I'm just like holding the dog up while she's on the phone saying there's a there's a black man who is who's threatening me I feel unsafe and the man was just like ma'am I'm not doing anything but watching Birds but Blackness and darkness of skin has become a weapon and perceived as threat and as a result of that in your own region some years ago it happened in our city as well a white man by the name of Charles Stewart murdered his wife and told the police that it was a homeless black man who did it guess who got arrested first the black man you fit the description later found out that he had murdered his own wife that happened in in my city as well about five miles from where I live maybe less than that years ago there was a wonderful Mall in a predominantly African-American Community called Northridge mall you can Google it Northridge mall and a white man named Jesse Anderson in the parking lot killed his wife call the police and say hey help send the police there's a black man who just murdered my wife and you know sounded real frantic and so forth and later found out he had did it but the history of that mall declined after that people started leaving oh you got to get out of this part of town this is dangerous the mall is closed and abandoned today there's a history of missed opportunities for the church and for society you all know Dr Henry Louis Yates and uh I heard I wasn't here I don't know but I heard that even no matter how educated you are you still black and you still fit the description and trying to go in his own house with his own house key was arrested to believe to be a burglar so they're they're they're missed opportunities uh and and one other statistic that I found very interesting there was a study done uh on the uh the wealth Gap here in this region can you put that that wealth Gap statistic up gone follow me like five slides ahead there we go uh the color of wealth um non-immigrant African-American households in Greater Boston um the wealth measurement is eight dollars 247 000 for whites 12 000 Caribbean blacks 3020 for Puerto Rican zero for Dominicans and this is based not on how much they have saved minus their income but it's subtracting their debt from their assets just some interesting statistics and a lot of things that I researched and for my own knowledge because I'm not again I'm not an expert I'm learning I'm a teacher I'm a counselor um I also found that you have your own museum that a lot of these facts and history are in even I found in this Museum the Lynn Museum that the Greater Boston area was the first city in America that allowed black people to vote it's called The Negro election day negro election day we get to vote right but a person that was elected was kind of like a king just for black people in that in the city didn't really have any power other than that so there's a there's some opportunities for us today uh to make things right let me say this as well because when we talk about Justice and we talk about race we start using muscles not physically but mentally and soulishly that we normally don't use and you know the first time you decide you're going to work out first time you decide you're going to run five miles you do five blocks right because you're using muscles that you haven't used before and those muscles like hey I'm not used to this I'm pulling over I'm pulling so if you don't pull over I'm gonna pull right you're going to pull a hamstring a calf muscle or something when we start talking about race and Justice we're lifting some heavy stuff that we normally don't lift and black people lifted every day now that's don't don't mean that we don't get tired but it means that we've been lit we've been working these muscles for 500 years in America 600 years in America so we have a larger uh capacity and stamina because we wake up having to deal with it regardless of your education or your economic level or what you've achieved in life every day you walk out of the door you're black and we're living in a racialized society but white people have not don't have to you get to choose whether you want to be a part of this conversation or not you get to choose because it's it's a privilege of being a part of dominant culture but I want to say this as well y'all understand what I mean when I say the difference between being racialized in racism let me let me break that down and I'll I'll go deeper racism is a sin being racialized is a consequence of living in a race based society racism is this racism is Prejudice plus power racism is not just I don't like you um I don't like your color I don't like your culture I don't care if people don't like me right but don't allow your prejudice to be mixed with power so now I don't have to rent to you I choose not to rent to you or I choose not to hire you or I choose not to give you the loan see now when you have power systemically that's married with the fact that I don't like that's racism it's Prejudice plus power we're going to go deeper uh in after the break into that but racism I believe a racialism so that's racism racialization is a result of living in a society that has racism and racialization infects all of us red yellow black white or brown I don't believe that everybody is racist but I believe everybody has been racialized and how it manifests itself in different ethnic groups it's different for white people it manifests itself that if you're not conscious and if you're not careful you can develop a sense of entitlement and superiority like the woman who called the police on the man who was bird watching right she used her Prejudice and her power I got the power I can call you and tell the police because I'm white that you're threatening me but that's that's because she lived in a racialized environment it's like living in uh Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the 60s where there were steel mills a steel town right Pittsburgh Steelers and imagine living next door to a steel mill and you grew up in that household your father grew up in that household your grandfather grew up in that household and every day just you know pollution's going up in the air and they all worked everybody in your family worked in the steel mill and you after three generations have the audacity to say you know what we've all worked here and lived here our entire lifetime but none of us have you know pollution in our lungs how is that possible in the same way it's impossible to live in a racialized nation one way in which race has been created to establish privilege for some and disparities for others and systems that enforce that in government that backs that and say I've lived in America all my life and my father and my grandfather and we've all lived and we've benefited from this privileges but none of us have been racialized I'm colorblind I know what you mean by saying you're colorblind but you're not really we all have it in us so how it manifests itself sometimes in in Hispanic or Latino population is they are they often feel frustrated and invisible as if you all are just saying that blacks and whites only have the history of of dealing with race What About Us maybe it manifests itself in uh in Blacks where some feel like hey I'm angry I'm going to take somebody out you know first white person that says something to me they gonna get it right that's being racialized the anger may come out or the sense of frustration or maybe feelings of inferiority that when a black person walks into a into an office of all black of all white people maybe they might feel maybe I'm not as good as I think I am so we all have the responsibility as Believers of getting that cancer out of our lungs because we've breathed it we've drunk the water for years it's in us so how do we get it out well that's another seminar we'll talk about that we'll talk about that next time but God has a dream the power of a dream God's dream is found in Revelation 7 and 9. that he would have a family made up of every tongue tribe nation and language that every ethnicity Every Nation would be part of his family and gather around his throne in Matthew 28 our commission is to go into all the world and Make Disciples of the Nations the word nation is ethnos that's God's Vision that's his dream and he's left us here to do it but we got to make sure that we're healthy that we're right in order that we can do it one of the things that we have to really dive into is and understand this culture the power of culture I don't know if you've ever heard this this statement I defined culture earlier it's what we do it's music food clothing how we talk you know those kind of Expressions but culture eats vision and values for breakfast culture is important every organization has a culture every city has a culture land is a different culture than Boston right every church has a culture every family has a culture um and if you don't know what the culture of your organization is you are probably in the dominant group of that culture because you don't have to know it it was created for you so you don't have to be conscious of it so if you want to know what it is ask somebody who's in the minority they'll tell you but when they tell you listen to them don't discount them don't don't rationalize it away oh because I can't see it I haven't experienced that well it's for you then it's not for me the systems were built for your benefit and privilege not for me but culture eats vision and values for breakfast it's important for us to understand culture and and to the degree that we increase our cultural competency is to that same degree that we can greater impact every ethnicity to hear and participate in God's dream now the lower our cultural intelligence the more offense the more bridges are going to be burned laws are going to be built up and people are going to reject us into Jesus is on on the inside of us what time is our break anytime now okay uh give me just a few more minutes and we'll take a break so I want you all to I want to take you on a quick journey of cultural competency there is a uh there's a school of thought called cultural intelligence and the school of thought is that IQ gets you hired but lack of CQ is what gets you fired IQ right intelligent my intelligence quotient right that's what that's that's my what my resume tells you how smart I am what my experience has been I don't care what your IQ is that will get you in the door but if you come in there and you don't have cultural intelligence you're leaving right because you're affecting the company's bottom line because you're causing us to lose employees causing us to lose customers causing us to Lose a Good Will in the community IQ gets you hired CQ lack of CQ gets you fired and there's a wonderful book by David Livermore called 10 cultural clusters and David Livermore is the executive director of a organization called the cultural Intelligence Center it's in Grand Rapids Michigan area and what he has done is that he has looked over the globe not just America because the the issue of justice and race is not just an American issue it's Global we have to increase our our cultural intelligence globally not just locally and he's he's identified 10 cultures or 10 cultural clusters uh like the Nordic culture I don't know if you all have Ikea stores here in the Boston area but the Ikea stores is really a that logo is really a symbol of the Nordic culture it's one that symbolizes uh simplicity minimalistic functional modesty and so those who are generally from that background uh those are some of the values humility equality in society those are Nordic values he identifies Anglo values now these are uh generally white people from Ireland New Zealand the United States the UK Europe Australia the icon he uses to identify anglos is deodorant because hygiene is important to many people that are from these these Anglo cultures and personal space is important to them now I understand why they're suburbs I don't understand why white people move away from townhouses and row houses and projects they got to have space it's a cultural value for anglos now I understand why colonization was birth out of this desire for space it's a very individualistic as opposed to a collectivist culture uh collectivist cultures are like we need to we need to have a meeting and decide to make sure everybody's in consensus individualistic is that hey if I want it I'm going for it foreign then there's this Latin culture that he looks at and uh Latin Europe culture in particular I'm not talking about Latin uh uh American or Southern uh America but Latin European culture is one one of the Clusters he looks at is like France and Italy and Spain and Portugal and the icon is fine dining and when McDonald's went to these countries to try to establish a foothold they had a hard time because uh in this culture it's important to dress properly to go and sit down in the restaurant have your first course have your second course have your third course have your fourth course maybe your fifth course and McDonald's is like you know put it in the Box put it in a bag give me some you know condiments and I'm going and so what they did McDonald's began gradually adjusting and to make that McDonald's kind of look like houses and the younger culture uh like you know here they like to go to dunks you know Wisconsin like to go to Starbucks it's like it's the end thing you feel something when you're paying five dollars for a you know regular cup of coffee is like I'm part of a community you know but what they did over there young folks go to McDonald's but they sit down and eat very few are drive through or just grab it and go uh he talks about Asian Confucian culture China Japan Singapore South Korea the icon is Chopsticks there's a widespread use of Chopsticks that's associated with confusion uh and unlike the fortune cookie take out carton Chinese restaurants that we have in America that's not the case in these Asian countries it's sit down it's it's and and if you want to go up higher in the wrong of of relevance in these cultures learn how to use chopsticks and don't drop your chopsticks because that's like a bad taboo don", "'t ask for silverware I'm from America I'm not gonna eat no chop you know give me this fork and a knife and a spoon okay that's like okay this this dumb American is here again probably wants it in the to-go box with a fortune cookie we don't do fortunate cookies in Asian countries it's an American thing he talks about the sub-Saharan African cluster Ghana Kenya nambia Namibia Nigeria Zambia Zimbabwe and I know you all know this but Africa is not a country it's a continent it's 52 countries and uh there is a there's a culture and the the icon is unbuntu which means that I am because we are we are better together it's a collectivist culture that to wait to illustrate this there was an anthropologist who proposed a game to a group of kids in an African tribe he put a basket full of fruit at the bottom of a tree and came back about a hundred yards spoke to the kids and said hey kids we're going to have a race I want you all to stand up whoever is the first person to run and reach that tree you get the basket of fruit he said okay on your mark Get Ready Get Set Go all the African kids grab hands and they walked together towards the tree because they were they were practicing the culture of umbutu I am because we are if I win we all win that's why many Africans in America when they come here they're sending money back home that's why African students struggle sometimes when they come and they go to college and they're in a dorm room by themselves they're like man I'm not used to this I need some people in this room with me I need to eat with somebody I need to have somebody sleeping on the floor somebody on the bunk next to me sharing the bed with somebody it's part of the collectivist culture it's not a competitive culture it's a Cooperative culture he goes on to talk about about many others but what I want to under what you to understand is that culture eats vision for lunch now those that are part of the majority culture don't have to execute don't have to consider other cultures and that's why there's been walls and bridges walls built and bridges burn because we see it in all the society we see it in media we see it in videos that illustrate insensitive insensitivity towards minority ethnic cultures things that are really kind of born out of this mythology of the rightness of whiteness we see it in even Disney cartoons like the aristocrats had a cat with slanted eyes and buck teeth a racist character of an East Asian even the fame Mickey Rooney dressed up in an over culturalization uh um exaggeration of stereotypical traits uh Dumbo included a group of crows that were paying homage to the racist Minstrel shows like as if the crows were wearing black face and talking in a Southern uh extreme Southern dialect the Aunt Jemima brand of Pancakes was dissolved after the murder of George Floyd because Quaker Oats said hey we're contributing to stereotypical behavior of culture so it's now called Pearl meal my wife can make some pancakes y'all and it's Pearl meal now you can't get at your mommy anymore the names have been changed and on and on and on are expressions now let me close by this and we take a break I believe that most people in the world most people in America most people that are in churches they're not racist they don't identify with David Duke and the KKK they don't identify with supremacist uh organizations now there are probably some that do I believe that most people are not they reject that but we all have been racialized and we all should wake up every morning thanking Jesus that he has washed us from our sins that we're on our way to heaven but as long as we are down here in this environment we have a duty we have a job every day I got to get that cancer out of my lungs I gotta every day I need to find a way and it's not just through prayer it's not just through scripture reading but there are things that that we can do we'll talk about that a little bit more

It is absent when something happens _to_ you.\n\n  * Hospitality exists when you believe the other person is on your side.\n\n  * Hospitality is _the sum of all_ the thoughtful, caring, gracious things our staff does to make you feel we are on your side when you are dining with us.\n\n  * Hospitality is a _team_ sport.\n\n  * Excellence is a journey rather than a destination.\n\n**Working with Volunteers & Staff**\n\n  * Ideas and ideals are the only currency for volunteers.\n\n  * Willingness to overcome difficult circumstances is a crucial character trait in my employees, partners, and restaurants.\n\n  * If you\u2019re trying to provide engaging hospitality and outstanding technical services, there must also be a certain amount of fun involved.\n\n  * I had already learned that the trick to delivering superior hospitality was to hire, genuine, happy, optimistic people.\n\n  * Most important, I watch my staff members. Are they enjoying one another\u2019s company? And are they focused on their work? If the answer to both questions is yes, I feel confident that we\u2019re at the top of our game.\n\n**Offensive Vs. Defensive**\n\n  * An \u201cathletic\u201d approach to hospitality: Sometimes playing offense, sometimes playing defense, but always wanting to find a way to win.\n\n  * _Offensive_ : Figuring out creative ways to enhance an _already good_ experience.\n\n  * Being proactive about hospitality. Example:\n\n  * _One day I noticed on a reservation sheet that a couple would be coming in that evening to celebrate their twentieth anniversary. That morning I picked up the phone to call them and thanked them for sharing the special occasion with us. \u201cBring a good appetite,\u201d I said,\u201c and enjoy your anniversary.\u201d The woman on the other end of the line was happily surprised to hear from me, and she was just about to confirm her reservation. \u201cNo need to call,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken care of.\u201d_\n\n _After we hung up, I confirmed the reservation and instructed the restaurant\nto send a complimentary midcourse to the couple that evening. Knowing it would\nbe something delicious delivered by a wonderful waiter, I was confident we\nwould create an evening worth talking about._\n\n  * _Defensive_ : Becoming better at overcoming most frequent mistakes or defusing whatever situations guests might be upset about.\n\n    * The point is to keep the dialogue open while sending the message: I am your agent, not the gatekeeper!\n\n**Service Vs. Hospitality**\n\n  * Service is the technical delivery of a product.\n\n  * Hospitality is how the delivery of that product makes its recipient feel.\n\n  * Service is a monologue--we decide how we want to do things and set our own standards for service.\n\n  * Hospitality is a dialogue. To be on the guest\u2019s side requires listening to that person with every sense, and following up with a thoughtful, gracious, appropriate response.\n\n  * I instruct my staff members to figure out whatever it takes to make the guests feel and understand that we are in their corner.  \n\n  * Hospitality can exist only when there is human dialogue.\n\n  * It takes both great service and great hospitality to rise to the top.\n\n  * Shared ownership develops when guests talk about a restaurant as if it\u2019s theirs.\n\n  * Initiate relationships with guests whenever it\u2019s appropriate.\n\n  * I\u2019m not there just to greet and shake hands. I\u2019m building daily communities within the restaurant\u2019s larger community.\n\n  * ABCD - _always be connecting the dots_ : Dots are information. The more information you collect, the more frequently you can make meaningful connections that can make other people feel good and give you an edge in business.\n\n  * \u201cToday\u2019s solo diner could host tomorrow\u2019s party of four.\u201d\n\n  * Most businesses are better at coddling regulars than they are at focusing on first-timers. But both are crucial to any business.\n\n  * People buy your product not just because of how the product itself performs, but to tell a story about themselves. Our job is to give people a story worth telling.\n\n  * Special occasions: People talk about where and how they celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays, and so those special occasions are especially rich opportunities to build world-of-mouth business.\n\n  * I encourage each manager to take 10 minutes a day to make three gestures that exceed expectations and take a special interest in our guests.\n\n  * Our job is not to impose our own needs on our guests: it's\u2019 to be aware of their needs and to deliver the goods accordingly. In hospitality, one size fits one!\n\n  * Know thyself: Before you go to market, know what you are selling and to whom. It\u2019s a very rare business  that can (or should) be all things to all people.\n\n**Enlightened Hospitality**\n\n  * Nothing could ever matter more to me than how we expressed hospitality to one another. (Whoever wrote the rule that the customer is always first?) And then, in descending order, our next core values would be to extend gracious hospitality to our guests, our community, our suppliers, and finally our investors. We would define our successes as well as our failures in terms of the degree to which we had championed, first one another and then our guests, community, suppliers, and investors.\n\n  \n\n", "\n\n**Staff Meeting 11.20.18**\n\n**General Notes - Pastor Joshua**\n\n  * WINS\n\n    * Joshua - having lunch w/ John Barry + new relational credit created\n\n    * David - Revere Thanksgiving 500 (previous Full Gospel ppl engaging, amount of food, turnout + impact)\n\n    * Tanisha - bday cards sent out w/ extremely positive responses\n\n    * Hoana - visiting a number of families (created a plan for the Gerardos to come to Wed night)\n\n    * Danielle - Revere Thanksgiving 500 (lots of food handed out + incredible stories)\n\n    * Carolyn - promo table sign-ups + Kalani\n\n  \n\n  * Calendar Requests\n\n    * Men\u2019s retreat - First weekend in Aug? **approved**\n\n    * Joshua Personal Day - Jan 4. **approved**\n\n    * PT personal day request Nov 24 **approved**\n\n    * Hoana switched her day off from Monday Nov **approved**\n\n    * PD- Can I book the Revere Chapel for Sat.

I feel like it would be better to have him be on stage saying he is up there to demonstrate to people how to sing and praise but not give him a mic or synth. I feel like it is that is being honest with him and is an actual contribution and a service. As I mentioned in my email, I am not sure that we have a criteria for telling someone they don't qualify for the team based on musical ability at this point with he and Jeff on the team._\u201d  What is our end-goal with Scott/the worship team in this situation? **the  process is, PK can place whoever he wants to be on a ministry team + we need to figure it out - PK is ok if it doesn\u2019t work but something else needs to be found - the importance is that everyone is working thru this - at the moment PK thinks this is the best spot for Scott - PJ to set up a meeting with Adam **\n\n  * Can we try replacing the outside sign with a teardrop sign?

The information from the insurance company wasn\u2019t overly helpful.\n\n    2. The AG (with Richard Hammar) has produced several training videos that suggest the following courses of action: \n\n      1. Hire uniformed officers from the police dept. and have them park outside as a deterrent.\n\n      2. Hire private security people.\n\n      3.

The Lynn Police Dept. is currently training two community liaisons to provide support for organizations developing active shooter plans, so I will meet with them once they are available. **communicate  with Jonathan**\n\n  * See attached for one way to have specific ACCESS standards that are in relation to IGNITE standards. **put  a sentence or two at the top \u201care there things that are not on here that should be here\" - let\u2019s find out what\u2019s missing - **\n\n  * I think we should experiment with breaking up this  Sunday\u2019s LEAD meeting to separate ACCESS-level people from IGNITE-level people. **talk  to PK about it - Ignite=PK Access=PJ**\n\n    1. IGNITE people (on either 4th floor or Cafe?) - focusing on leadership development (LEAD OTHERS).\n\n    2. ACCESS people - focus on becoming faithful, available, teachable and missional in basic ways (LEAD YOURSELF).\n\n  * Mike Neves asked about joining the ACK team.  He has been through ACCESS, so he technically can, but he is only recently sober.  Should we have a length of sobriety for people wanting to go into ACK for drugs or alcohol? **no  \\- 5yr plan bc he\u2019s been up and down for too long - he is not safe or the right person to be working with kids period **\n\n  \n\n  * I believe that I have successfully cancelled Ministry Pass as requested.  \n\nTasks:\n\n  * be in the room for one offering count to see if there are mistakes that need to be caught\n\n  * meet w/ Bobby + do a blue sky session with him + transition him to something else\n\n  \n\nDavid Urbina\n\nQuestions:\n\n  1. **Revere: Observations from last preview week**\n\n    1. I think we need a pre-determined altar time key for synthesizer/piano/strings that can last to the end of your sermon video. Otherwise, the transition is very abrupt/distracting. **work out with Adam**\n\n  2. Can I install the handicap ramp permanently in Revere?  **no - use and then put away - it is meant to be temporary**\n\n  3. How can I get the offering video that will be picked every Sunday? **Revere needs the same video - PH to make sure both locations get it**\n\n  4. Video - sounded muffled\n\n  5.

How would you like the media team (s) to be structured? I would like to have either Amy or Hoana (our most tech-savvy people) onsite at Revere if possible as there are details that can fall through the cracks and our current volunteers know only basic setup. And, would that person then answer to you directly or to me? **action step = who the media person/ppl (Amy will not be pulled over - PH is assigned here) on launch day, PR most likely will be  there - on-going though, we will need to pick out who the media person will be + get them fully trained (Carlos cannot be in change of anything)**\n\n  10.

Diaper pail for nursery - Suggested by Jeanine, she also said workers should really wear medical gloves when changing diapers/handling dirty diapers as some illnesses can be transmitted via body excretions. **yes**\n\n    8. Blinders for all windows for light control (especially main auditorium/media room), there are too many visible distractions **  not blinders but a shade or curtains - put this into Revere ToDoIst list**\n\n    9. A storage container like the other churches have to put our stuff.  **we need to get all new storage ones - PK has been looking - wait a minute to order**\n\n    10. Wireless mic - chord mics are two distracting between transitions \n\n    11. An extra sound machine - There is still too much noise in the main auditorium even with 2 machines turned all the way up **hearing ppl going to restroom, slamming doors, hitting electrical heaters - put  into Revere ToDoIst**\n\n    12.

he wanted to change the world so he would read, study, call friends, attending meetings/conference to resource himself in order to do this - it took more than 40hrs a week - there became these spots where you need to figure out how to do it -

you learn how to resource yourself + you put that into practice and then you will go into a new season of learning and how to resource yourself again\n\n    * staff need to be open in what 'you don\u2019t know what to do' with PJ - sometimes the answer will be go figure out how to do it + sometimes it will be ok let\u2019s figure this out together\n\n    * we are in the God has given us much so we need to steward it well - it may not be money but people - we need to equip them into leaders \n\n  * On being a pastor\n\n    * you are never not a pastor, you are never on break from being a pastor\n\n    * while you are on staff here, your voice is PK\u2019s voice and the voice of ECIC\n\n    * when you speak words, it\u2019s as if PK is speaking - it will show up as \u201cthe church said\u201d bc people hear it that way - this includes posting on social media\n\n    * staff does not make policy independently but is done as a team\n\n    * we are politically neutral as a staff - we are not to comment on president Trump or anything else - we need to remember this will not help us reach lost people to Jesus it could actually harm us \n\n    * \u201clet\u2019s be patient, pray for our leaders, I\u2019m somewhere in between\", it\u2019s ok to encourage education/reading on a personal level but you still need to be guarded if someone asks you your opinion \n\n    * exceptions = anything that is blatantly moral is ok to take a strong stand on (i.e. immigration issue)\n\n  \n\nCommunication is the art of being understood\n\n  \n\n  \n\n", "\n\n**Staff Meeting 6.19.18**\n\n**General Notes**\n\n  * PK asked staff what is something you have physically built:\n\n    * PH -

he ask John Thurel to take over\n\n    * he made a great ask, 16 hours assigned, but too much free reign given to John, didn\u2019t coach him on how to get volunteers, ((PK + John both like to be the one doing the task))\n\n    * in the early stages, you are the only one that is going to get it done - no one else will own it the way you do, see it they way you do, it\u2019s all on your back BUT there needs to be a moment when we stop being the primary person + release that authority to others - + it will only happen when you decide - do you go get volunteers or do you go to them\n\n    * 400+ go from a doing to becoming a specialty trainer to lead\n\n    * this is about teams - if your ministry is under 85 ppl, it\u2019s on your back + you carry it forward on your skillset -

our holy week podcast this week we're going to be taking a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it [Music] hello everyone hey guys happy monday happy monday day two of holy week today we're gonna be looking at jesus's activities on monday mm-hmm isn't there a fancy name for monday it's like something monday no that's monday thursday i always get those confused no that's i think what i was thinking of no okay i don't know if there's a fancy name for monday but we're gonna look at what jesus was doing the day after the triumphal entry and just five days before he died on the cross so we're gonna start off by reading a short passage in mark and then switch it over to matthew if you're following along you can see the references in the description hopefully so starting off in mark chapter 11 verse 12. it says the next morning as they were leaving bethany jesus was hungry he noticed a fig tree in full leaf a little way off so he went over to see if he could find any figs but there were only leaves because it was too early in the season for fruit then jesus said to the tree may no one ever eat your fruit again and the disciples heard him say it oh wow little snap that's crazy so i have heard that some scholars believe this is referring to um old testament passages about the leaders during that time who were very unjust and kind of taking advantage of what god had given them and they were bearing stinky fruit bad fruit it was rotten oh yeah right on the tree um yeah that's kind of gross um and so i'm gonna read a passage in isaiah that um might help put some light to why jesus was so angry at this fig tree all right isaiah 5 verses 1 to 7 i will sing for the one i love a song about his vineyard my loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside he dug it up and cleared it of stone and planted it with the choicest of vines he built a watchtower and cut out a wine press as well then he looked for a crop of good grapes but it yielded only bad fruit now you dwellers in jerusalem and people of judah judge between me and my vineyard what more could have been done for my vineyard that i have done for it when i looked for good grapes why did it yield only bad now i will tell you what i am doing what i am going to do to my vineyard i will take away its hedge and it will be destroyed i will break down its walls and it will be trampled i will make it a wasteland neither prune nor cultivated and briars and thorns both grow there i will command the clouds not to rain on it the vineyard of the lord almighty is the nation of israel and the people of judah are the vines he delighted in and he looked for justice but saw blood shell bloodshed for righteousness but heard cries of distress that's intense there's a lot yeah i feel like that puts that passage really well into perspective mark's storytelling style is so funny to me because he he just doesn't really take time to explain anything he just kind of like boom this happened moving on boom this happened and so he's just like yeah jesus got mad at fig tree and cursed it moving on right like and when we read the book of mark in bible coaching together a lot of times people are kind of like oh my goodness i thought jesus was like a nice guy and here he is he's mad at the patriot it says it was out of season but as we talked about yesterday jesus was being very intentional with every step that he took and so this holy week was um not an exception to that but an amplification of that it was like these are his last moments with his disciples and he is just like it's revelation after revelation after revelation and the the gospels even say like after the fact we we reflected on this and we realized oh like this is what was happening oh look at how these scriptures talk about this other thing that jesus did and we didn't even realize it in the moment but now we see clearly um and so i always feel like first of all jesus is the creator yeah so how dare the tree not give him fruit like he made it you know he made all things so that's that's the first thing like it's not like he's you know being some entitled brat he's god you know to begin with and then second of all he's being really intentional to try to teach the people around him and we're going to talk a little bit more about the fig tree tomorrow so we'll just put a pin in that and we want to read about the rest of what happened on monday of holy week so we're going to be looking at matthew chapter 21 again picking up where we left off yesterday with verse 12. all right verses 12 to 17 jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice he knocked over the tables of money of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves he said to them the scriptures declare my temple will be called a house of prayer but you have turned it into a den of thieves the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them the leading priests and the teachers of religious law saw these wonderful miracles and heard even the children in the temple shouting praise god for the son of david but the leaders were indignant they asked jesus do you hear what these children are saying yes jesus replied haven't you ever read the scriptures for they say you have taught children and infants to give you praise then he returned to bethany where he stayed overnight awesome awesome so it seems like there wasn't a ton going on this day in terms of the story isn't very long but it's actually really really profound i think so yesterday jesus had this huge moment where he entered the city of jerusalem as the the rightful king coming to take his place and then he goes home and so that was this really incredible moment and now today he comes back to his city i'm just going to call it his city he comes back to his city jerusalem he comes back to his temple and he's starting to set things right and showing kind of what it looks like when he's in town when jesus is is there um and so it's kind of two parts to the story of the day but it took all day long he started off by clearing things out and then he and then he continued to fill the space with exactly what it was supposed to have so i wanted to share a few reflections on um what jesus was doing clearing out the temple uh john actually tells about how jesus cleared the temple and it talks about how he he made a a whip out of leather cords um and you know just so you know too we're we're dividing these passages up and there's four different tellers of these stories and it's not always a hundred percent that everything we say is divided on the days the way that we have it but this is a really good rendering of it um some people think that jesus actually this wasn't the first time he cleared out the temple that he had done it before and other people think that those are all stories about the same moment but whatever the case is we know that he came into town and he took over like he was he was you know um throwing tables and you know letting doves loose and he had a whip i don't know what he was doing with the whip but i can imagine it just like crack you know like is everybody's kind of like what in the world is going on and at first it almost seems a little bit strange for me because i i love jesus right and i i think of jesus as this like gentle and really really like kind and loving and giving person yeah and here he is kind of like raging in the temple and and when you think about it too he's who is he raging at it's like people who are um selling animals for sacrifices and money changers and whatever and it's kind of like temple related business so at first glance it almost seems like why isn't this okay you know like it almost seems like you've just got this beautiful seamless connection between a bustling economy and uh you know a place of worship and the temples become kind of like this community center where all of like this interesting stuff happens and so it's like almost got this like one-stop shop kind of feel yeah like come here bring the money that you had which a lot of people needed to do that because as we talked about before a lot of people were making pilgrimages in to jerusalem for the holy festivals this week and so let's say you're a farmer that lives like two days journey away from the city of jerusalem and you have crops of wheat or whatever and you want to bring to god your tithe of wheat well it might be difficult for you to bring it at the right time and for it all to be fresh and to carry all those bundles of wheat and so a lot of times what people would do is they would sell their wheat they would have the money and then when they got to jerusalem they would buy something of equal value and they would bring that to the temple so that they didn't have to travel with all of their goods right so it was kind of like you know business interactions or transactions that you would kind of imagine going along with the temple yeah but it was happening right inside the temple right inside the temple and jesus is kind of saying listen my house the temple is holy yeah it's intended for a specific purpose it's not a one-stop shop it's not a community center it's not a place for all the busyness of life to flood in it's a place where you prepare in advance to arrive and it's dedicated to the things of god it's dedicated to the purpose for which it was built and you're not supposed to bring in all of this other chaos all of this other these task things that you have to get done and i also imagine that there was a you know um making a profit component to a lot of these tables right because he calls them a den of you've turned it into a den of thieves right so he's also not happy with the justice component of the transactions that are happening right i'd be interested to hear from the old testament perspective because i know he's quoting old testament verses here yeah what do you see in the old testament when you look at that yeah so this is a thing that spans kind of hundreds of years we're sort of seeing the state of the the pharisees and the sadducees and the spiritual leaders of the time and their hearts are just not not there and jesus is exposing them for that but but this also spans back into the old testament and so jesus quotes from jeremiah 7 11 and he also quotes from isaiah 56 7. um jeremiah 7 11 talks about how the house of god has had been made into a den of robbers and then there was just a lot of um exploitation going on financial expectations just people who were supposed to be the leaders who were supposed to be the ones taking care of the temple using it for their own evil desires and uh just malicious intents um and then i also want to read from isaiah 56 it's it's a pretty cool passage but jesus references it when he talks about what the temple is supposed to be as opposed to what uh these evil leaders have made it um what these selfish leaders have made it and his house is supposed to be a house of prayer so let me just read from that is isaiah 56 it says this is what the lord says maintain justice and do what is right for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed blessed is the one who does this the person who holds it fast who keeps the sabbath without desecrating it and keeps their hands from doing any evil let no foreigner who is bound to the lord say the lord will surely exclude me from his people and let no unit complain i am only a dry tree for this is what the lord says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbath who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant to them i will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters i will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever and foreigners who bind themselves to the lord to minister to him to love the name of the lord and to be his servants all who keep the sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant these i will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations the sovereign lord declares he who gathers the exiles of israel i will gather still others to them besides those already gathered and so this is just a telling of what god's house is to be it's like all of the nations are welcome into this place all who want to come and worship jesus are welcome to this place and this is to be a holy and a sacred place full of of worship and joy and prayer yeah and instead they've made it into a place of business and and even a place of exploitation yeah i think it really shines through like the way jesus's heart when you think about it it wasn't just this like man i'm angry at all what all of these people are doing but it you know it's it's this i want people to come near me yeah and to get to be with me right and not be harassed by um people taking advantage of the fact that they you know needed to make a last-minute purchase to transaction to get a dove or whatever like it was like my house is a place for people to come near me you don't go to my house motorcycles you don't go to my house you know so that you can just do this ritual of like oh okay i you know i i give the money to the person the person gives me the animal i give the animal to the priest the priest does the thing like just this like wrote like right it's not transact business transactions it's a relationship and and that's a huge thing a huge point that they're missing if they're caught up in in the functions of it exactly and that's exactly what prayer is i think sometimes we can try to like dress prayer up with prayer strategies and like you know prayer techniques and like oh did i pray the right way but ultimately prayer is just conversation between you and god it's it's the cornerstone of every relationship is conversation right you know and so it's it's a place where you're supposed to be able to come and speak to god speak with god and come and hear from god yeah and have that back and forth and nothing should be interrupting that so that kind of brings us to the second part of what jesus did with his day which i imagine took up the bulk of the time once he had cleared out all of these money changing tables and businesses that were going on i love the way the message puts it that verse in matthew chapter 21 14 it says now there was room for the blind and crippled to get in they came to jesus and he healed that's awesome yeah so it was like not just a clearing of the temple so that it could be empty and pristine and this nice beautiful place but so that the blind and the crippled could come and get healing and calm and interact with their god and yeah do you know what i mean it was so that the house of god could be full of what it's supposed to be full of right um and so i love that you see jesus doing three things throughout the day um you see jesus healing people it talks about how people lined up all these people came to him and this was normal if you know anything about jesus's ministry he could barely travel because of how many people were you know pressing in around him for healing um and he was also teaching the people and what a cool moment like if you were a jew at that time you had no idea right like you just were hearing a teaching from a rabbi but it was captivating but in all reality you were actually hearing god wow talk to you that's crazy in his house i mean how cool would that be if we went to church on sunday morning and pastor kurt was like we have an incredible guest speaker this morning god will be giving the sermon today you know like and so people got they just got to hear straight from jesus as he taught and then there's this little part in there it's like goes by really quickly this blip with the kids worshiping jesus but i i really wanted to zone in on it for a second because the kids um the kids say to jesus what is it they say they say praise god for the son of david and i love this right because you think first of all okay what so there's kids there like but of course there are the city is full of people who have come for this festival and he just cleared out all of the business people but not so that it would be empty but so that it would be full and now there's crowds of people listening to jesus preach asking him to heal them so of course there are families everyone is there men women and children all around him and he is getting this incredible audience and you can picture these kids who probably some of them had heard the triumphal entry from yesterday and had heard their parents like shouting and had heard like the praise and the worship that was going on and so now you can just i can just picture like kids like running around like you know like turning it into almost like a game like playing tag or whatever in the in the outskirts of the temple areas their uncle got healed from his you know like bum leg or whatever and they're just like praise god for the son of david praise god for the son of david and just i don't know is there such a purity there and something so beautiful about that it's like that's what the temple was supposed to be full of a community center in the sense that the community is there yeah but it's full of the things of god and so that it was hitting every a socio-economic stratosphere every generational stratosphere everyone was welcome and everyone was able to participate in what was happening so these kids are worshiping jesus they're worshiping jesus in his house they're worshiping the king and here come the pharisees yeah they're not too happy about it they are allowed to have as usual they're jealous of jesus they're mad at jesus and they're also scared of jesus because he's getting popular and and they don't like that because they want to be popular and like who's this guy coming in and you know drawing all these crowds and we can barely get people to listen to us but second of all like he's saying stuff that challenges them that is making exposing them like you were saying before yeah he's exposing them hardcore hardcore he is and so there are some pharisees that actually called jesus out and were like do you hear what the children are saying like like they're realizing that this is inappropriate the son of david like it they're calling on this prophecy about jesus as the messiah right but jesus turns around and says yeah don't you know what the scriptures say yeah and then he quotes what is it he's quoting yeah so here he's quoting psalm 8 2 and it says through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger wow crazy yeah so he's talking about how the how god this is it did david write this psalm uh yes cool so david wrote this psalm david man david was like in the spirit he wrote a lot of prophetic scripture yeah and they're they're using them obviously david's psalms were very actively used they just quoted from one when they were saying hosanna right psalm 118 and now today yeah psalm 8. powerful timeless and memorable and at the same time deeply prophetic and so jesus says jesus says okay not only am i the son of david to you pharisees who are offended by that yeah but i'm god yeah if you look if you pay attention haven't you this is what jesus said haven't you ever read the scriptures for they say you have taught children and infants to give you praise god you taught children and infants to give you god praise so he's saying these kids that are running around saying praise god for the son of david they're praising god when they're praising me right and so once again you kind of see this if you're looking for it you see jesus talking about who he is in no uncertain terms for the people who are listening they would have caught this right and they would have known exactly what he was saying and that's why they were so mad and they began looking for ways to kill him this is when the disciples really were like boiling over and so they began trying to figure out how are we gonna get rid of this guy this has gone too far but they've got no idea how to do it and um one of the gospel writers says that they were they were frustrated in their efforts to get rid of jesus because the people were hanging on his every word yeah which is really like for me that that speaks to me today because i want to be somebody who is hanging on jesus's every word i want to be somebody who is benefiting from the house of god and the things of god someone who is worshiping god someone who is coming to jesus for healing and coming and hearing sitting at his feet and hearing his teaching and just inviting him to do in my heart and my life because we know from romans right that we are the temple of god i just want to make sure that god is clearing out the temple of my life and filling it with the things that he wants it full of yeah not emptying it out because everything's bad and i have to get away from everything but emptying it out so it can be full of exactly what it's supposed to be full of all of these good and beautiful and holy things that jesus cares about so why don't we as we're just wrapping it up for today why don't we close in prayer together do you want to lead us christina sure all right god i thank you again so much for this time as we searched your word and learned more about you god i thank you for that jesus and i thank you for the the privilege of being able to look back over this story that spans hundreds and thousands of years god and just to see how you brought it all together and and just to be able to see the culmination of it in jesus god and i thank you jesus for coming for doing all of this for us and um that this is a story that we share and that we're a part of god that it was for us just as much as it was for them god and i thank you jesus for that and god i do i do just want to take a moment and pray as emily said that you would um that you would empty us of everything that is not right that is not of you that is um unjust or against the character of who you are god and i pray that you would fill us up with prayer and worship and joy and um just a a dedication to you a devotion to you god that we would be in relationship uh in a right and good way with you god and and in a holistic way god i just pray that you would fill us up god we are yours jesus and and i thank you for that god thank you for that jesus and god i pray that you would bless every person listening as they go about the rest of their of their days god that the the joy that you have for us would be um in them today god and and that we would all be little houses of prayer walking around worshiping you and joyful in you thank you so much for that jesus in your precious name i pray amen amen thank you so much for joining us today guys don't miss out happy holy week it's just getting started we've got a bunch of awesome podcasts coming up for you so hopefully we'll see you tomorrow yeah awesome have a good day guys bye [Music] that you died [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Laughter] [Music] in heaven you", "on morning morning all right it's great to see you today we're gonna Jump Right In we have a today I'm going to introduce you to two men abishai and Joshua beam common names I know we find him in second Samuel chapter 23. abbishai son of Zariah the brother of joab was the leader of the 30. he once used a spear to kill 300 enemy Warriors in a single battle it was by such beats that he became as famous as the three abhishai was the most famous of the 30 and was their Commander though he was not one of the three so some language there you may not understand there's this guy named King David he was the leader of the people he had two groups of awesome Warriors one was a group of three these were the most elite of the elite the special services then there was this group of 30. these were also really Elite Warriors but they weren't part of the three so two distinct groups abhishai was in the group of 30. and he had to be kind of a force to be reckoned with the kind of guy carries a spear around with him ready to knock out like as many people as he can it's the kind of guy that you would go anywhere with because he's got your back and honestly he's clearly a little bit crazy you know taking on 300 Warriors by yourself and thinking you can do that that requires you to be a little bit crazy you know what I mean like I have some sturdy friends that they got my back in a time of need but if I'm being honest I feel safest when I got some of my just a little bit crazy friends with me that's why I love linen Revere so much right you know a little bit crazy a little bit crazy up in here so look a lot crazy up in here so uh so I think we're a part of the head here okay anyhow in your life so the question here today is in your life how do you become an abbishai how do you position yourself to be able to take down the Giants that you face to ward off the 300 enemy attacks of Satan on your life and still be standing how do you see that mountain that's been in front of you for years or decades how do you learn to climb that mountain and turn it into your surfboard and surf it all the way out to the ocean in order to do that you've got to increase you have to increase your minimum you have to get yourself ready tell your neighbor get yourself ready all right now tell yourself get myself ready okay crazy people talking to yourselves yeah I told you you have to qualify somebody say qualify you have to you have to qualify yourself for the dream you could all have a dream and I hope you do but are you willing to do what you need to do to qualify for that dream I don't know if you know this but those crazy people that ran the marathon last week you know the Boston Marathon running it looked like they're all about to die to me but anyhow there's all running and running you have to qualify to run that race you have to want to run that race and then you have to run really good for a long time in order to qualify to run that race if you're going to be one of the contenders I have no desire to qualify to run that race I don't want to qualify that is not in my in my space but in order to run that race you have to qualify and our dreams and our lives that in order to accomplish you have to qualify to even start it you have to qualify so let's challenge ourselves to step up to qualify and to be careful not to disqualify yourself in the process I am disqualified to run the Boston Marathon because I'm not willing to try to qualify so I'm disqualified now in that scripture in the passage in uh Titus Chapter One it talks about the qualifications for a pastoral leadership or eldership and one of the things it says at the very beginning is an elder must be blameless and then it then it goes on and lists all of these things and there's throughout the scripture there are several qualifications in scripture for spiritual leaders at least 17 total and I have kind of squashed them for today's purpose into a few broad General categories that we can learn and grow together as we try to qualify ourselves to fulfill the dreams that God has given us so today I want to teach you and for some to re-teach you uh this principle on how to qualify yourself uh to be an abishai here we have a little bucket and in this little bucket we have several States these little these little pieces of wood they're called staves new lesson for you today uh in the in the cities we don't deal with staves a lot but these are these are the staves in this bucket and imagine this bucket here if you if you want this a buck a bucket to be effective and you want to fill it up with stuff like water or gold coins whatever happens to be you throw these the stuff in here if you want it to stay in the bucket you got to take care of these states because they can get worn out over time and not be as effective as you'd want it to be and so because it's not expect the stuff just falls out you pour water in water comes out water comes with water and you're not actually accomplishing anything this bucket right here looks great kind of like a first date [Laughter] kind of like a first date right right looks good from one side but from the other side it's not gonna hold it's not gonna hold right foreign but if you want a bucket full of Health in your life you've got to take care of all the states like you got to take care of this little guy right and if there's just like one thing in your life that isn't firing good enough it's not firing all cylinders it's just like maybe this far then they all that's as high as your health can go like that's as high as you can get maybe you only get to take out like 12 enemies instead of 300. right that's the idea here okay and so your your attack you're trying to get as much health as possible uh with the same illustration and so here's a few staves for you to think about one is a Stave of spiritual health a state of spiritual health in the bucket of your life you have all of these things one of them is your spiritual health these are your fundamental spiritual disciplines that you put into your life to qualify in this area things like prayer we have a week of prayer and fasting here's an opportunity for you to join together you'll probably do a lot of it separately but we come together for a combined purpose to pray and to fast to seek God and His purposes in our life okay so we're praying other is scripture engagement this is our year of Bible engagement and we've been encouraging you to read different passages of the Bible at different times and so we engage intentionally with the scriptures there's also the aspect of generosity things like tithes and offerings now every once in a while somebody will come up to me and I'll have this great dream they want to go change the world they want to do whatever it is that they want to do is great it's awesome tremendous and one of the things that I check early when with people is when they do this I'll ask them the question what are you currently financially contributing to help make that happen for somebody else good and if it's zero I don't believe that person because they have disqualified themselves from pursuing the dream so in order to fix that state they have to learn to be generous right stinginess is a major sign of spiritual unhealth sharing the good news of what Jesus uh is doing in your life with other people right that's that's a spiritual discipline that's something that we learn to do praying for the sick to be healed making time in your life for authentic Christian Community I'm gonna teach you something right now there are 168 hours in a week one terrible week a year there's 167. and another great week here is 169. but in general there's a 168 hours in a week you can't actually make time it's somebody else has made time and it's not you what you can do is you can carve out time you see you will never find the time in your life for Christian Community ever you have to create the time by by carving it out of your schedule and then considering and treating that time as completely sacred this is sacred time for Christian Community and that's hard to do in a really really hot we live in the fastest Pace region of the country year over year over year the Greater Boston region is the fastest pace of life in the country which means we have to work twice as hard to carve out the time in our schedule but why is that so important because that's a that's a Stave issue right you could have you can settle for just like a little bit or you can like make make a really significant effort at it next is intellectual health Proverbs chapter 1 verse 22 says how long you simpletons will you insist on being simple-minded how long will you mockers relish your mocking how long were you fools hate knowledge it's calling us up to be better in this area of our life intellectual Health becoming lifelong learners you see the lower the level of your intellectual Health the lower the stave on your Barrel and so you can be doing great in the other areas but that can be a weak spot and it just pours out of your bucket of Health that you're trying to build so you're allowed to read a book every once in a while now to listen to a book if you don't know how to read and if if you can't afford a book go to the library or borrow one from me you can see You've Got One Life to Live it well invest in yourself so that you can go after the dreams that God has given you so you can be an abishai and take down the enemy when he comes against you next would be Financial Health Proverbs 3 9 says honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce you've heard me say it a lot debt destroys dreams debt destroys dreams we all understand that well I don't know if we understand it we've experienced it maybe okay if we understand it maybe we would stop doing it personal financial ignorance should be something that you wage war against that you don't settle for personal financial ignorance if your dream involves an organization you must achieve organizational Financial Excellence as well as personal this is a barrel Stave a Stave of the barrel issue then there's physical health Proverbs talks about this it says worry weighs a person down lots of things impact your physical health spiritual emotional social all these things impact your your physical health it kind of there's a weight to them that can hit you your physical health health can collapse if we don't intentionally prioritize it I mean everything in our society fights against us from having achieving physical health it's but the lower the physical health uh The Stave on the bucket is the harder it will be to maintain overall health in your life and accomplish your dreams it's a constant battle for many of us now as we're going through this list Perfection is not the goal progress is the goal we're not saying hey that Barrel that'll all be fooled by next week let's make a little bit of progress if we're at three percent let's go to four percent if we're forty percent go to 41 like just make some progress folks it's okay make a little progress listen we have 52 Sundays a year 52. if you changed 52 times in a year we'd all be like flying in here like Angels okay I understand we don't really change 52 times in a year let's just make some gentle progress let's just let's let's go towards the Finish Line one step at a time okay make progress not perfection then of course there's mental emotional health Romans chapter 12 verse two stay with me on this it says don't copy the behavior and customs of this world so hold that intention over here behavior and customs of this world but let God transform you into a new person somebody say new person how do I be a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know God's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect can we like that last part the will of God that is good and pleasing and perfect which requires us to know his will which require us to have been transformed in our thinking if you've ever read the Bible with any level of authenticity you have probably disagreed with it I have disagreed with the Bible so many times I have been wrong every single time but you know what the process is the process is recognizing that I have been corrupted by the behavior and the customs of this world that teach me to think and be a certain way but when the scripture comes in and I am confronted with the scripture then I have to wrestle with it and I have to engage with it it doesn't mean I get there right away it takes me a while the reason I'm hoping that I can be patient with you is because I'm hoping God can be patient with me because it takes some time to get there but the process is learning to be transformed in our Thinking by turning our corrupted thinking into God's thinking letting putting aside our street smarts and picking up Spirit smarts so that's that's that that trade-off it's sometimes honestly you need a friend or a person to help you transform your thinking you need somebody to go on that Journey with you sometimes that might be a professional Christian counselor for kind of high level issues but other times you need mentors and friends and pastors and small group leaders and just people that will go on the journey with you you just are going to journey together when you tackle these things head on so that you make progress again Perfection is not the goal progress is the goal we're filling up our bucket with health we're taking care of one Stave at a time and of course relational health this is this comes down to like your choice of peers your your choice of friends during the pandemic we discovered that relationships are even more complicated than we thought before lots of relationships disrupted lots of complicated things if you're an introvert if you're like if like me or like a super introvert like the pandemic had a season of like being really awesome but you know what introverts don't like to admit this but introverts still need people also confessions from an introvert birds of a feather flock together they say they're right Proverbs 13 says walk with the wise become wise if I want to be wise walk with the wise associate with fools and get in trouble if you find yourself in trouble a lot guess what you got some foolish friends hopefully you won't be one of them and you'll learn to walk with the wise so in your journey to be an abhishai find your people find your people not the foolish people find the Wise people Proverbs 24 27 do your planning and prepare your Fields before building your house the idea here is that there take some intentionality before you're going to do something great you have to plan and and prepare so you intentionally need to find your people intentionally go after the people you want to learn from the people you want to grow with the people you want to learn with the people you want to serve with the people you want to do life with the people you want to go Slaughter some Giants with the people you want to take on the enemy with you got to find those people I got a lot of people in my life that I'm willing to do that with I got some other people in my life I'm not going there with them all right pick the first pick the wise so who should you be with abhishai did this how do I know this he clearly had been hanging out with people further along than him think about that further along an average side the guy that killed that took out 300 enemies with the spirit he didn't just show up one day and say like I'm super abishai like I can I can take it on I can do it all by myself specifically had a guy in front of him named Jojo beam in verse 8 earlier it says Joshua beam the hackamite who was leader of the three so that three and thirty the three mightiest Warriors among David's men so there's guys in front of abishai David's men he once used his spear to kill 800 enemy Warriors in a single battle what 800 abishai knocked off 300 and out of context it sounds like abhishai is The Greatest Warrior hand-to-hand combat in human history turns out he was a rookie because he had somebody in front of him Joshua beam to set the example for what was possible he could dare to dream that he could go after those 300. he could dare to dream that the enemy was come chasing him and he could stand and he would make it out alive so the goal here for us today is find your Joshua beams that are in front of you and the people that will walk with you Propel you challenge you give you boldness to help you see further than you could see on your own some of you grew up in situations where the farthest you can see in front of you is like 30 seconds you're just surviving so you got to get some people in your life to understand how to see further they can even see the best in you that you can't see yet and when you're with somebody that has your calling or has a similar dream and they nail it like Joshua being killed 800 then taking on the 300 doesn't really seem like that big of a deal oh they got 800 I could certainly do three it helps you get your head around it I grew up in a super tiny Church in rural Indiana a church that loved people and each other but I couldn't really figure out how to be a larger Church partly because there weren't a lot of people around so when it was time for me to intern my pastor refused to let me intern with them he said to me go find the largest church that will let you intern with them an intern there so I ended up in East Hartford Connecticut it was a great church I lived in the projects with a wonderful Puerto Rican family that summer I ate more rice than beans in the first dinner than I had eaten in my entire life first off now listen if you know my story first off I didn't know what a Puerto Rican was all right that's a true story I was very young and very white and very rural second when they put the rice and beans and chicken on the table I thought it was the family platter and it turns out it was just for me it's just such a great moment in my life anyhow so anyhow this church that I was interning at they had multiple Services they had a smaller building multiple Services they had over a thousand people come every Sunday and uh then later on I served at Calvary in Linfield at the time it was just a small Church and over the years it grew significantly and today it's a couple thousand people here's what I'm trying to teach you as the worship team comes up foreign part of the reason that as a church we've been able to grow is because we were deeply influenced by Ministries much further along they have consistently grown they are much much further so it was easier for me to see it I could see it so I could believe it I could say I can get there we can get there together let's go this had to kind of tuck in behind their wake and kind of learn some lessons along the way and kind of add our unique uh cities to that a few years ago I was kneeboarding in Jamaica and that sounds fancier than it really was but we were kneeboarding in Jamaica and uh I was not really doing a very good job I would get up and I would I would constantly tip over in into the ocean and I was drinking more of the Ocean than I was kneeboarding on CE I learned actually stay up I figured out that if I stayed in the Wake like the calm part of the week that I could get up and I could get up pretty easily and then once I was set then I could do my extreme sports moves right so you know you're jumping out in my mind I'm like doing triple flips and I'm just holding on for dear life in reality but I couldn't make any progress until I got in the wake I couldn't make any progress until I got behind that thing that was in front of me I just needed something out in front of me today is what we're calling connection Sunday and that's because we believe that we are truly Better Together than separate and so we're gonna we're gonna try to help out with that a little bit today I want you to know that at different seasons in your life you do different things in different seasons in a church you do different things sometimes there's a season where you go out and you're just so out you're outward Focus out out out out you go and you get and other times you have to take a moment to go in and be better together and that's where we're at right now why don't you stand with me as we close [Music] the worship team's gonna lead us in this last song then I'll come up afterwards and we'll have some uh we'll pray and they'll have some instructions for you from there but let's let's just close together", "all right is on Sunday September 29th coming up very soon now like since the pandemic make sure that they're here and uh make sure that uh you've invited somebody to come to church with you and just let me give you a hint if somebody has never been to church before in their life which I know a lot of our friends have not uh in fact the vast majority uh just just to make sure that you get this right the vast majority of uh English-speaking people in the city of Lynn have never been to um a church for real it's it's a true true statement the vast majority of them so they really don't have any idea what happens in here so you can only imagine what they think happens like because if you've ever watched media if you ever watched a TV show if you ever watched a movie about what people think happens in church you can just imagine what they think happens in here so that's what they think you're doing okay just just to make sure you understand so you may you may have some like communicating to do also so you might want to help them uh get here if you bring them so uh let's do that on Sunday September 9th just go out of your way to help somebody uh make their way here um today uh we are uh talking a little bit about the distractor sneakiest strategies and so we'll get into that here for many years I had a special bag badge and this badge would allow me to go into the Middleton prison uh not for anything I had done but some of you a lot some of you a lot of you have been there for a different reason this allowed me this allowed me to go directly into the prison uh during the day with special permission and to visit without special permission and to visit any of the guests of the prison okay and uh in order to get this badge I had to go through quite a bit of training where to walk and not to walk so the dogs wouldn't eat me and what doors to touch and not touch and but mostly this is what they wanted to teach me they wanted to make sure I knew what I could bring in and what I could not bring in so that I would not become an accidental mule of sorts no no matter how well-intentioned God is good H the safest way uh if you wanted to know how to do something illegal I'm about to teach you the safest way to do something illegal is to recruit somebody else to do it for you amen who doesn't know who you are that works for just about anything illegal once somebody is recruited properly you can use them for just about anything they can be used for sabotage or deception or covert operations or assassination just about anything the apparatus of most intelligence agencies the operations are built on this idea of Lies deception and using people generally foolish or uh people that get trapped in these lies usually these agencies follow the same pattern the recruit doesn't realize what they are going to be doing the recruiter fools them into thinking they aren't doing anything particularly bad and then the recruiter traps them into situations where they can see no choice but to do whatever it is they're told to do for example when Russia uh was recruiting American spies during the Cold War the first thing they would do was ask somebody for simple public information that was available in any phone book if you remember some of you know what phone books are I know not all of you do okay but um these are these yellow thick things and never mind the so but little by little they would ask for more and more information so first it didn't seem like a big deal and then it got more complicated well the enemy of our souls has a recruiting plan that is actually quite similar and so we're going to track that today in Matthew chapter 7:3 Jesus says this Jesus says you can enter God's kingdom whenever Jesus talks about God's kingdom make sure you pay really close attention you can enter God's kingdom only through the narrow gate the highway to hell is Broad and its gate is wide for the many who choose the easy way now let me tell you the signs pointing to the highway to hell are not neon signs that flash Highway to Hell here the great distractor is much smoother than that he has a great deal of subtlety in luring us off the beautiful and narrow path onto the highway to hell the Highway to Hell might be a great rock and roll song right but it is a terrible destination for Life the Bible gives an account of the life of a man named Samson who we'll be talking about today Samson was a man that possessed great physical strength he was selected by God to lead his people but unfortunately he had some weaknesses and his decision to reject the will of God ultimately brought Samson down this morning I want us to look at just one of the seasons in the life of Samson as he goes careening down the path of destruction and look for those sneaky strategies of the distractor and the warnings along the way so that we can recognize how Samson got on the wrong path so that perhaps we can recognize the same strategies in our own lives in time to get back on the straight and narrow and if you don't know the whole story go to the Book of Judges in the Bible and you can read it's in judges 1314 or 14 era and you can read the whole story the first sneak is the simple one the seemingly insignificant strategy like the public record phone book uh it's it's a simple enough recruiting strategy of the enemy and it's it's this one it's really simple it's getting somebody to be careless it's just carelessness somebody say carelessness carelessness okay and we find it in judges 14: 1 and 2 and it's hard to tell that it's there but it is one day when Samson was in timna somebody say timna he noticed a certain Philistine woman when he returned home he told his father and mother I want to marry a young Philistine woman I saw in timna now I don't know I don't think that Samson was trying to get in trouble at this point I don't even think he was going down to timna to look for a Philistine woman he was just being careless and in case you don't understand what's going on here uh the Philistines because she's a Philistine woman the Philistines in the Bible are the bad guys like the really bad guys you're not supposed to have anything to do with the Philistines the Philistines uh have ens snared uh the Israelites and Samson's whole point is he's been chosen by God to deliver his Nation from the oppression of the Philistines but along the way he makes a few mistakes or a lot of mistakes the Bible uh talks to us about them and one of the facts here is that he's he's noticed this Philistine woman somebody say noticed not the text it says he noticed her that's interesting it doesn't say that he was looking for her it says he noticed her amen the point is he was careless you see he may not have gone down to timna looking but he certainly was looking while he was in timna amen because that's how it works friends amen when you put yourself within temptation's reach you end up doing things that you wouldn't ordinarily have done the scripture says that Samson went down to timna what's the big deal he wasn't supposed to be in timna yes timna was a border City in no man's land between the Philistines and the Israelites you see he wasn't supposed to be there at all so it just kind of you have to as the Bible just assumes you know that like it's reading like you're supposed to read Tima and go uhoh he's not supposed to be there it was populated with both some Jews and some Philistines it was kind of like a large red light district of a large city it was kind of a place where a man of character definitely would not go and the scripture says several more times that Samson went down to timna a place of Temptation because he was careless he was careless see and this matters because Samson wasn't a regular man he was exceptional and just in case you think this is not about you today you are supposed to be a you are not supposed to be a regular man or woman you are supposed to be an exceptional man or woman okay God didn't make you to be ordinary he made you to be extraordinary you see we have a room full of people that God has chosen so this is about you today not just about some guy a long time ago amen he had been hand selected by God to be the leader of the people he was raised by Good People godly people that gave him a Godly Heritage he had been raised to honor God so he didn't have beef with his family and when Samson went to a place where he wasn't supposed to be he became entranced with a woman he wasn't supposed to be entranced with and that was a problem I want you to know that what happened to Samson happens to us too because I bet if you take a look at some of the most Pro problematic situations in your life today I bet you can trace the beginning of that problematic situation all the way back to a decision that you made to be some place where you weren't supposed to begin weren't supposed to be to begin with amen like you ended up you you put yourself in a place where you weren't even supposed to be at and it didn't seem like a big deal but you know fast forward five years you're like oh man I wish I'd ever went to that place what that means is that Samson wasn't really seduced by Temptation he willingly of his own free will took steps that led him in the wrong direction he was careless what was he careless with he was careless with his curiosity you ever been curious about something yes a lot of people are careless today with their curiosity he was careless with his life he was careless with his right living he was careless with his calling he was careless with his purpose and the scripture is plain to us in its message about our first line of defense we are supposed to be careful with what God has entrusted to us you see God has entrusted to you a gift God has entrusted to you a calling God has entrusted to you a purpose something for you to do something for you to be and you are supposed to be careful with it you are not supposed to be careless with your life or careless with your calling so in other words don't run into temptation run away from it don't put yourself in complicated places 2 Timothy chapter 2:22 run away from anything that stimulates youthful lust instead pursue righteous living faithfulness love and peace enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts so don't put yourself on a careless path so if the producer of a reality television show called Temptation Island calls you up and invit you on to be a contestant on the television show just say no thank you in fact don't even pick up the phone don't even pick it up press block report report so it doesn't come again avoid careless Temptations don't even put yourself in a scenario if you are married don't don't Place yourself in careless situations don't be careless with sacred things amen amen if you struggle with keeping your thoughts pure welcome to 2024 first of all but second if you struggle with keeping your thoughts pure don't don't give yourself access to unaccountable and careless opportunities if you get into debt easily also welcome to 2024 but if you get into debt easily cut up your credit cards and don't apply for the scams that will entice you to get another if if you stop smoking weed also welcome to 2024 the uh then don't go over to the place where everybody is smoking weed amen if you're trying to get into shape don't find yourself at McDonald's there is not a human being in the entire world that has ever gotten into shape going to McDonald's I can testify to that uh so I tried and it failed if you are working at becoming an encourager you can't surround yourself with constantly negative griping and complaining people amen because when you are careless you make careless mistakes in other words don't be careless live your life with an intentionality and with an intense Integrity as if your life dependent on it because your life does depend on it that's the point so the next strategy that the distractor of our soul uses to recruit us it's not the first one was carelessness second is compromis let's let's continue the story verse three Samson his father and mother objected strenuously about the woman isn't there one woman in our tribe or among all Israelites you could marry why must you go to the Pagan Philistines again the Philistines are the bad guys to find a wife but Samson told his father get her for me she is the one I want his father and mother didn't realize the Lord was at work in this creating an opportunity to disrupt the Philistines who ruled over Israel at the time again if you don't know the whole story you can go and read the whole thing about your own as Samson and his parents were going down to timna a young lion attacked Samson near The Vineyards of timna now Young Lion normally if a person is attacked by a lion that is the end of the story okay right that's the but the story continues at that moment the spirit of the Lord powerfully took control of him and he ripped the Lion's Jaws apart with his bare hands he did as easily as if it were a young goat I don't know what that means for real I I I couldn't rip the jaws of a young goat apart that seems like it's really difficult to do these are different kinds of people than us today he did it as easily as if it were a young goat but he didn't tell his father or mother about it interesting when Samson arrived in timna he talked with the woman and was very pleased with her later when he returned to timum for the wedding pay attention to this he turned off the path to look at the carcass of the lion which he had killed earlier quite some time earlier he found that a swarm of bees had made some honey in the carcass he scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate it along the way and he gave some to his father and mother and they ate it but he didn't tell them there it is again he had taken the honey from the carcass of the Lion Okay the second the second strategy was compromise but you might not see it here unless if you don't know the context of the whole story what he did here is he compromised his vow he compromised his word he compromised his promise you see at this point Samson's Behavior can't just be blamed on carelessness there's an intentionality going on here and you might wonder what the big deal is the big deal is this Samson was supposed to be honoring something called the Nazarite vow for life at God's instruction this is who he was because he was the leader of the people he was set aside as holy he was supposed to be doing a certain set of things a certain kind of way and one of the rules for Samson is this he is not to have any contact whatsoever with dead things including a dead lion so touching a dead thing thing an unclean even an animal that's dead would have made him unclean even if it was absolutely necessary he was still not supposed to do it as a Nazarite Samson had absolutely no business being anywhere near a place where he knew that a dead lion would be now it sounds ridiculous to us I know if I knew that there was a dead lion out there I would go look at the dead lion like like every week I would want to go take a picture of the Dead lion to see how much it was decomposed I'll be so curious about the dead lion I'll be like look at my look at me next to the dead lion selfie next to the dead lion that's what would be happening but Samson's not allowed to do that I don't have a Nazarite vow Samson did he was not he was compromising Samson knew what he was doing and what how he compromised was this he turned off the the path to look at the carcass of the lion have you ever heard the expression curiosity killed a cat I don't know what happened I just went to look I didn't mean to touch it I was just looking not only does he go to look he he sees that it has some honey in the carcass now hopefully you're tracking with more than just being a lion and honey there's honey in the lion and he eats the honey out of it because friends that's exactly what the devil does when he's trying to make you unclean he sneaks some honey in the Dead Lions of your life ask your neighbor do you have a deadline yeah do you have a deadline it okay if your neighbor said yes don't ask where what it is okay don't ask where what it is right so go listen friends I want you to pay attention to this because somebody here today in person online somebody has a dead Lion in their life that they've been getting their honey from and that honey has been intoxicating and that dead lion has been making you unclean for a very long time and it's time to walk away from it see the devil's sneaky like that you know you're not supposed to touch dead lion so he put some honey in it so it seems like it's got to be okay because there weren't it's you can just see it Sam's like well God must be providing for me because there's honey but but God already told him he's not supposed to touch it but God must be providing because no Bees stung me but he already knows he's not supposed to touch it but I was famished and it was there right for me but he already knows he's not supposed to touch it he already knows God doesn't have to tell him again he already knows whatever your dead lion is it's time to walk away yes it is the dead lion has a way of making you unclean and then he he does this horrible thing he he feeds his parents from it because his his parents aren't supposed to be touching dead stuff either and he covers it up because he planned to go take a look at his lion and samsons at this point smack dab in the realm of compromise one of the enemy's recruiting tactics these is quickly sending Samson down this slippery slope of Destruction carelessness and compromise it's funny how once once a little bit of compromise sneaks in it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse I don't know if you're aware of this but every tax season uh I'm I'm reminded of this the story that uh the federal income tax for the average American has not always been around like are you kidding me when was it like like it hasn't always been here in the United States it said that when they first uh instituted the federal income tax that there was a debate on the in the senate floor and there was one of the um Senators that said that stood up in opposition to the idea of a federal income tax ta and supposedly he said if we allow this 1% tax foot in the door 1% at some future date it might rise to five whole percent. apparently he was correct and the compromise we made then impacts us all now just one little thing another and then another than another Samson also compromised his relationship with his parents he was dishonoring his parents by not being honest verse six it says he didn't tell his father or mother about it verse 9 but he didn't tell them about the lion situation he was keeping secrets he's building a veil of secrecy he's he he he compromises himself because he no longer has the protection and direction of his Godly Parents that could have Pro protected and provided for him now he's not a child anymore we understand he's an adult but he still could have had their protection their counsel their guidance he compromised he compromised his gift as well even though Samson was careless and compromising God still had gifted him and God was still trying to fulfill his plan in Samson's life it says that the spirit of the Lord came upon him why because God was still trying to use Samson but somehow Samson got began to think of this gift of God that this gift of God was his of his own doing his like super strength was really his he went to the gym a lot or something and he began to forget that the real reason for his gift was from God and for a higher purpose and it is an interesting idea and pay attention to this friends don't ever think that because God uses you or has gifted you that that means he is necessarily pleased with you on because God uses people all the time to accomplish his plan and purposes many times in spite of them that should help you understand why it is that somebody can seem so anointed by God or gifted by God or used by God and then you find out later that they were a hot mess behind the scenes because God was trying to use them to help somebody else even though they were still a hot mess you know that's between them and God okay and we can all probably relate to that quite honestly God uses people in spite of our own selves but that means that you could be light years away from God God you could have turned your back on God you could have forgotten that the gifts you possess were actually given to you by God and that you could go out and use those gifts but if you use those gifts for the wrong purpose for your own gain and Advantage uh you are what you are doing is you are compromising yourself and you're compromising those gifts amen it doesn't NE you're not being blessed by God for your own gain there's a kind of scary passage in Proverbs chapter 13 18:22 it says this says the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous one of my many favorite verses in the Bible that's why you always got to have a wealthy sinner friend right so you know the wealth of the sinner is stored up I love that verse anyhow so just because you're blessed does not necessarily mean you're all set amen God May set you up to be blessed even when you in a bad spot in order to accomplish his purpose at a later date with somebody else you might be the sinner whose wealth is being stored up for the righteous if you're compromising you know that's true compromise always matters no matter how small your reputation matters even if it's only you and God that knows compromise is indeed a slippery slope one which eventually leads to the third recruiting strategy of the enemy which is company particularly bad company verse 10 as his father was making final arrangements for the marriage Samson threw a party at timna as was custom of the day 30 young men from the town were invited to be His companion Samson said to them let me tell you a riddle if you solve my riddle during these seven days of the celebration I will give you 30 plain linen robes and 30 fancy robes but if you can't solve it then you must give me 30 LEM and robes and 30 fancy robes all right they agreed let's hear your riddle so he said from the one who eats came something to eat out of the strong came something sweet three days later they were still trying to figure it out on the fourth day they said to the Samson's wife get the answer to the riddle from your husband or we will burn down your father's house with you in it did you invite us to this party just to make us poor so Samson's wife came to him in tears and said you don't love me you hate me You' have given my people riddle but you haven't told me the answer I haven't even given the answer to my father or mother he replied why should I tell you so she cried whenever she was with him and kept it up for the rest of the celebration at last on the seventh day he told her the answer because of her persistent nagging then she gave the answer to the young men now the rest of the story is awesome you'll have to read it on your own at home now at a simple glance the chapter doesn't seem like a big deal but who is at the party 30 men from the town the bad guys 30 the bad guys these men have only one desire in their life which is to see Samson and his people captive or destroyed so why is Samson a greatly gifted individual what is he doing with such bad company maybe he's tricking them maybe he's got like a secret plan spying on them that's not really what's going on on Samson side of things things Samson has simply surrounded himself with bad company and he's allowing it to corrupt his good character or at this point not so good character but Bad Company corrupts good character yes it does it always has it always will even the most gifted strong wise and brilliant people are corrupted when they find themselves carelessly compromising themselves with Bad Company also notice secrecy one more time rears its ugly head first Samson held secrecy from his parents and now his wife is holding a secret from him obviously she should have told her husband what was going on why didn't she because he had surrounded himself with Bad Company including his own wife man and I want you to get this very clearly today secrets are not a good thing Secrets destroy Secrets destroy trust Secrets destroy intimacy Secrets destroy relationships Secrets destroy the the spirit your spirit 2 Corinthians chap 4:2 says we have renounced secret and shameful ways the Bible is not a fan of big secrets the type of secrecy we are speaking of here today is nothing short of evil yes as the worship team comes up if you are considering doing something questionable for example you're not sure if you're supposed to do it or not and uh if you can't tell if you're supposed to do or not but and you're like you're like um maybe I should tell my parents they like oh I shouldn't tell my parents or maybe like oh I should ask my spouse if it's something I should no I shouldn't ask my spouse or maybe you maybe you should ask one of your pastors no I shouldn't ask one you already know you shouldn't do it okay you're you're holding it a secret it's the secrecy that gives it away because the secret has a life of its own it wants to stay in darkness it wants to fly under the radar because it's evil it does not want to be exposed oh no have you ever heard somebody use the term narc or rat you know we usually have these phrases or use it a negative context because we don't want people telling on each other why is it an issue when somebody turns somebody else in for harming themselves or somebody else that's not a problem in fact if it's an exposing of secrecy is a stand for justice then that's an honorable thing you may not be legally required to do anything but you are morally required to expose wickedness and Injustice this is what we're supposed to do regardless of what culture says the year I transferred to Gordon College I I transferred midyear so I was assigned to a roommate he was a nice guy and uh I liked him a lot we seem to get along one day I get back back to my dorm a few weeks into the semester and all of his stuff was gone completely moved out uh he had decided to move in with some of his party boyfriends and uh a year goes by at school and one day I'm in the dining hall and he sits down next to me and asks if we can talk and he said I I need to apologize for bailing on you and I said hey it's no big deal no big deal I got a single room for the semester it was awesome it was awesome but the next part was the most important part he said when I came to Gordon I came to Gordon because I knew I was supposed to prepare myself to go into Ministry and I got really distracted by all this other nonsense and whenever we would be in the room together I couldn't breathe because I would be so convicted that you were doing the stuff that I was supposed to be doing amen so I just ran away my my former roommate he had been careless with his calling had been compromising of his gift and really been corrupted by Bad Company as we're sitting there in the dining hall that day I just reminded him it's not too late it's not too late to turn it around it's never too late same thing for you today amen no matter where you're at it's never too late it's not too late turn it around would you stand with me as we [Music] close let me just ask you this today this for you to be able to respond if there's something today that it's just time for you to turn it around then today is your day go ahead and start the process of turning it around maybe you watch walked in today getting your honey from a dead lion you weren't ready for that one today God just surprised you with it maybe you need to come to terms with getting rid of that dead lion and walking away just surrendering to the call of God on your life whatever it is today the altar room but let's spend

myself my family my daughter and I um you know I just want to say that I'm deeply grateful for this opportunity that I get to to bring God's word with you for you today and and hopefully we can learn something valuable and Powerful about God's love but before we jump in I'd love to open up with a word of prayer would you join me God I am so thankful that you are a loving and generous God that you never give up on us thank you for your faithfulness your commitment to us and I pray God that at this time we would just open up our hearts to hear what you have to say to us today through your word in Jesus name we pray amen amen hey man I'm so excited you know I'm glad that we have been going through the Book of Genesis if you're joining us for the first time today welcome and uh we've been going through the Book of Genesis and looking at some important things but you know before we talk about our topic for today I want to go over it with you some I want to share some tips that are helpful for me when I read the word of God and I think you know it might it might help you as well so um if you're taking notes I'd love to give you three helpful tips for reading the Bible and in particular the Old Testament the Old Testament can be a little bit complicated uh the first tip that I want to give you is that we need to meditate on the word of God when we engage with the word of God it means spending some time really listening and the goal of reading the Bible is to know God more amen that we want to know God more and meditation helps us to do that and the main goal of the Bible isn't to speed read or to read through the Bible in a year or you know to read it just so that you say that you've read it all those things are fine but we really want to think about the goodness of God in the same way that a cow chews grass we want to chew on the word of God over and over again slowly have you ever seen a cow do that you know when they eat they're very it's very slowly they just kind of munch on it and and we take it with us the second tip is that God is the hero of the Bible God is always the hero he's always the one that is doing the awesome stuff and no matter how awesome humans appear to be in the stories we read God is always the real hero and anytime we see conflict in God's relationship with humans it is always humans that are walking away from God and God is the one trying to restore that relationship and lastly the Bible interprets the Bible because the Bible is a unified story all the way throughout with the with this theme of God being the hero it's incredibly helpful when we read a particular story to see if there are any other parts of the Bible that reference that same story because a lot of times it helps to bring Clarity and a greater understanding I want to talk to you today for a few moments about the God that runs to the rescue can you say with me the god that runs to the rescue and I want to share with you an experience that I had that really marked me um it's kind of tragic and I'm still wrestling with some of the after effects of it but on September 19 2017 Mexico City experienced a devastating 7.1 magnitude earthquake my wife and I happen to be on vacation there that day by the grace of God unfortunately for us the morning of impact we were visiting some famous pyramids about an hour away outside the city and Upon returning to our hotel that afternoon we found the entire city in complete chaos and Terror over 300 lives were lost and countless others injured and the fear was evident in people's faces I don't know if you've ever had one of those experiences where you can see the fear in people's faces it's hard to describe but you could you could sense it in the air that evening as we walked the city's main Square looking at the destruction we saw a couple of people and heard a loud voice shouting over a megaphone in the distance and as we approached the message became clear and we saw that they were Christians holding up signs quoting scriptures and boiled down to its Essence the message that they wanted all to hear in in that time of Crisis was we told you so have you learned your lesson now this is God's punishment for your disobedience turn or burn have you ever heard those those kinds of folks painfully oblivious to the suffering around them it was as if these people were glad that this tragedy had happened even though they were using the name of Jesus I remember thinking in the moment that it seems to me that they don't have the spirit of God the spirit of Jesus they may be quoting scripture but they're misusing it to kick people while they're down essentially to abuse people who are hurting and worst of all through their lack of compassion they were perpetuating The Stereotype maybe you've heard it it's a stereotype of a wrathful bloodthirsty god with a short temper who is eager to punish the Disobedience at the slightest provocation and in case you didn't know friends if you're newer with us that is not the god of the Bible that is not the god of the Bible now today we're tackling a complicated part of the Bible and we're talking about Sodom and Gomorrah because I thought why don't we tackle something light you know today and so we're talking about Sodom and Gomorrah and it's going to be okay uh as we've been in the Book of Genesis over the past few weeks we've been looking at the lives of some signature characters right remember we've been talking about Abraham we've been talking about Hagar we've been talking about Jacob and we've been talking about Isaac and today we're looking at two cities cities can be important important characters in in the Bible and what we know about Sodom and Gomorrah is this that they were a part of a network of cities in a region that were destroyed because of their wickedness and on the surface it appears that that's all the story is really about you know uh bad guys you know they get on God's nerves and so he destroys them lashes out on them um but that is a very low resolution understanding of the story and my goal today is to walk with you through the story and as we will see shortly this is actually a story about undying hope God's Relentless love and his desire to rescue his broken creation and the links to which you will go to rescue us to rescue you to rescue me we catch up with a story and what's happening here is that God is on his way to deal with the situation he's on his way to deal with what's going down in Sodom but he makes an interesting Pit Stop to talk to Abraham in Genesis 18 it says so the Lord told Abraham I have heard a great outcry can you say outcry I have heard a great outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah because their sin is so flagrant and I'm going down to see if their actions are as wicked as I have heard if not I want to know here we see a picture of God as a a righteous judge and you know a God who is not equipped to judgment but he's investigating he's deliberating he's trying to gather the evidence and and he wants to know if it's as bad as he has heard that's that's very interesting you know a lot of times we we can't fathom how God could be a judge you know and and judge people but the truth is is that God hates anything that harms people and sin harms people and so he must grapple with the issue of sin but how will he do that and that's what we're going to see the first thing that I want to talk with you about today and as we break down the story is what happens when humans how many humans here in the room right what happens with what happens when humans decide right from wrong like we're going to be the ones to decide right from wrong do you ever watch one of those uh reality TV shows where really messed up people live together I know some of you are thinking I live with those people like no they take a whole bunch of chaotic narcissistic and obnoxiously loud super important they're always obnoxiously loud and and they locked them in a house for several days and you know they essentially throw away the key and turn on the camera right they let it roll it's it's fascinating to see them go back and forth and all of their drama or how about one of those TV talk shows with with tons of Dramas any of you remember like Jerry Springer and or Maury man it's okay you can you can confess your sins right now hey man uh right right be like you know Jerry Jerry right they're beating up on each other on stage and and all these things but have you ever seen like one of those episodes where the the family or the couple like it they're so jacked up that you think to yourself I'm glad I'm not them right I got my issues but I'm glad I'm not them right now a lot of times when we read disturbing stories in the Bible we may be tempted to feel that way like I'm glad I'm not them hey I I know I know I'm I'm bad but like Solomon Gomorrah that's on a whole different level but when it comes to reading the Bible if you ever come away feeling that way you probably need to go back and read that story again slowly read it again and again and allow it to speak to you because unlike TV talk shows the Bible is like a mirror everybody see this mirror here next to me the Bible is like a mirror and uh I like the the TV talk shows and all these things it reveals to us the Bible reveals to us an undistorted picture of the most broken and dark parts of human nature and it pulls no punches it's simply real and it's simply simply Raw it tells you the details and so I encourage you when you get home or later this week go back and read the story there's a lot of really graphic details it holds it pulls no punches it's just telling you what it is now when we think about this story we need to focus on what it reveals about us as humans and what it reveals to us at the core is that we are prone to getting ourselves into messy situations have you ever been in a messy situation anybody right you ever find yourself asking how do I keep getting into these messy situations right like like how does it happen that I get into these Cycles or in these uh complicated moments in my life and the Bible calls this propensity towards messy situations sin it's what happens when we as humans decide for ourselves what is right and wrong instead of trusting God's definition of right and wrong it's our own paradise and if you remember Paradise just as a recap if if you're just joining us in Genesis in the beginning God created a good world a good world with the idea of partnering with humans to manage it manage that good world and as long as they trusted God and trusted his definition of right and wrong they could enjoy his abundant provision and continue to govern the world under his protection and that was Paradise that's what Paradise looks like in the Garden of Eden but shortly thereafter a serpent enters the picture and calls into question God's character and so what the serpent essentially tells the human is the humans is are you guys sure that you can trust God's ability to judge right and from wrong you know what God's really just trying to keep you down from your real potential you should be the ones deciding right from wrong and Adam and Eve fall for the Serpent's deception and sin by eating the forbidden fruit and they are expelled from a paradise and the next Story We encounter the first murder a Cain kills his brother Abel out of jealousy and an act of Injustice so get this the humans are in charge of deciding right and wrong for like two seconds and immediately the consequences are that chaos and death and suffering have now become part of human history something God never intended several chapters later in Genesis we find that as humans have multiplied and built these large cities sin and evil have also multiplied within those cities and that's where we get Sodom and Gomorrah as a picture of another attempt yet another attempt of human beings living in Paradise without God that should be like a bumper sticker right living in Paradise without God right in parentheses you get a t-shirt and what's the result what's the result it's not Paradise it is Injustice and we can see that in Ezekiel 48 it says Sodom sins were pride gluttonly and laziness while the poor and needy suffered outside her door so we see that these people have also given themselves over to violence and mistreatment of foreigners and misusing God's Gift of sex and that that's just the tip of the iceberg there's a lot going on down in Sodom but the question we should be asking ourselves when we read stories like this is how often do we attempt to build our own version of paradise without God how many times do I try to find meaning and life outside of God's protective love what are the areas in my life that are like Sodom where I'm not trusting God's goodness and purpose for my life because what happens is there's an outcry that comes from these situations when Cain kills his brother God actually tells Cain your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground and so that that same language for a cry of Injustice or a cry for justice is the same language that's being used to describe what's happening in Sodom and Gomorrah people are suffering and that is rising to the ears of God you know I grew up in a church a very traditional Church my parents are our ministers and I grew up hearing the story over and over again and you know unfortunately I I grew up hearing a lot a talk uh really this story being used as a commentary about inappropriate sexual practice but nothing else it's like that's it that's the point of the story right is that the trump card this is bad this is evil and that was it and and it's it's kind of it's kind of sad because uh what's truly fascinating in this story is that it shows us something about God's character and that is that God is not surprised by the sin part he's not shocked at what's going down in Saturn you know have you ever seen someone who says oh passionate I'd love to go to church but if I walk in there the roof is going to cave in right and I just want you to know if you were afraid of that today and when you were walking in if that was going to happen it would have already happened because you and I are in here right so you're good you're good nothing's going to happen um but God is not surprised by that by by the messiness of the situations that we get ourselves into he's not disengaged he's not baffled rather he runs into the mess that is Sodom like a firefighter running into a burning building to rescue people God runs into our mess that's a major theme in the story isn't it awesome to find people now and then who are willing to roll up their sleeves and help you before you ask for their help I I love that I love that you know before you have to call anyone they're just there they're just they're ready to help a while back I had a car that was giving me a lot of problems and one time it was late at night and I was driving home after a church event and I had stopped at a traffic light and the engine turned off and it's one of those times when you're like this is the worst time please no like I need help and I try to crank the starter but nothing it happened and I realized that I just needed to try to push the car or something you know to get it going but I was by myself and I jumped out of the car and just as I was going back to uh to towards the back of the car and as I was having that thought man I need help a random stranger pulled up on the on the road next to me got out of the car and without asking any questions started pushing the car he started pushing the car and so I immediately started pushing the car uh as well and together we got the car running and without saying a single word he got back into his car and drove off and I was able to make it home I don't know his name and you know if he's watching thank you thank you for that time will you help me out um but I didn't know where he came from but it's as if I had called a friend and said hey hey you know hey Travis come help me you know and he and he was there but but he came and isn't it awesome to have someone to run in and help when you're in trouble before you even ask and that's a picture of what God is like I want you to know today friends if you remember nothing else from this message that no matter how complicated the situation is that you are dealing with no matter how impossible the challenges or how messy it is God's response is to run into our mess that's his response to come and to help you might have had some people in your life that have walked out on you when things got complicated but not God God never gives up on us he always runs into the chaos even when we are the ones that have caused the chaos how many of you enjoyed that video where we had people sharing their testimonies about people that have influenced them right uh We've over the past few weeks we've seen grandparents friends uh all kinds of of people that have just come around people and impacted them just by the way that they live and that's an awesome thing one of the reasons we've been showing those testimonies over the last couple of weeks is to remind ourselves of the impact that our faith has on other people on those around us you see something awesome happens when we take on the responsibility of being light to the people around us when the people in your closest circles your neighbors your friends or family members watch you following Jesus it makes an impact whether you realize it or not you're sowing seeds you're sowing seeds that are gonna flourish and give off fruit that's why Jesus said in Matthew 5 you are the salt of the earth but what good is salt if it has lost its flavor can you make it salty again it will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless in other words our role is to be like salt us Believers and it is to preserve and to add flavor to things in our community is to connect with people to impact them when we love Jesus and share our lives with others we are giving them a chance to see the light of Jesus earlier I said that the story was about God's Relentless love and his desire to restore his broken creation and the links to which he will go and so we're going to look at that right now because it's it's not apparent when you first read it like where is the goodness of God where is the mercy and I want to go over some things that happened where God sends circumstances and people somebody say circumstances and people to warn Sodom and Gomorrah first of all we have lots somebody say a lot all right number one we have a lot in second Peter 2 7 it says but God also rescued lot out of Sodom because he was a righteous man who was sick of the shameful immorality of the wicked people around him so here we have lot Abraham's nephew who goes and lives in Sodom the original sin city right he's living he's living there in Sodom and last week we talked about prophetic reenactment this is the idea that the story of Jesus can be seen in the lives of really jacked up and imperfect people in the Old Testament and a lot really going into this wicked place is uh you know and choosing to live a righteous life is really a picture pointing to Jesus who would later come down to this wicked world and live among us so we have law then we have Abraham God sends Abraham to rescue Adam to rescue Sodom and Gomorrah and there's actually this interesting story in Genesis 14 where uh Abraham rescue Sodom and Gomorrah from captivity after a humiliating defeat in battle they try to revolt essentially and basically Sodom and Gomorrah they get their butts handed to them right uh and in verse 10 it says as it happened the Valley of the Dead Sea was filled with Tar Pits somebody say Tar Pits and as the army of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled some fell into the Tar Pits while the rest escaped into the mountains the Victorious Invaders then plundered Sodom and Gomorrah and headed for home taking with them all The Spoils of War and the Food Supplies so again just to recap because law is living in Sodom at the time and gets carried off as a prisoner of war Abraham goes to rescue him with a small army and in the process he manages to rescue Sodom and Gomorrah and recover their prisoners of war and their Treasures so even after all this that God is doing from Sodom and Gomorrah there seems to be still a lack of genuine gratitude or repentance on behalf of the king of Sodom you would think that the painful chapters in our lives would help us to reconsider our decisions to reconsider our past and that's not that's not what's happening with Sarah there's a famous quote that says God Whispers to us in our Pleasures speaks to us in our conscience but shouts in our pain have you ever had a painful situation where it's like God was trying to speak to you trying to speak a message to you an important one and that's what happens in moments of pain many times those tar pit moments in our lives are God's way of calling out to us to return to him it's important that we listen and respond in those moments so we have lot we have Abraham and now we have God and His angels okay now when when God has to come down and get involved in a spectacular way you know that he means business and and what he goes down to Sodom and Gomorrah but he makes this pit stop and on his way he he shares his plan with Abraham because you know God has promised him that he will be a blessing to the Nations and what Abraham does then is he's able to intercede he's able to pray for Sodom and Gomorrah and God says that he's willing to forgive them if even if there's just a few people in there that will turn from Evil he will forgive them did you know friends that you being here today is an answer to someone's prayer people have been praying for you for a long long time whether you realize it or not and now you're here God in the end goes down himself and sends angels to sodom's doorstep and what happens is the people reject them mistreat them the men in the town actually attempt to assault them in a horrific way and this is what the Angels do after that in in Genesis 19 verse 10 it says but the two angels reached out pulled the law into the house and bolted the door then they blinded all the men young and old who were at the door of the house so they gave up trying to get inside here we see a picture of what it is like to be spiritually blind and willfully blind it's one thing to be blind because you didn't have the opportunity to know it's another thing for for us to be blind because we want to be blind because we we don't want to see the light and Jesus said in John 8 I am the light of the world if you follow me you won't have to walk in darkness because you will have the light that leads to Jesus and so we see here a picture of of darkness and and rejection of God's kind attempts to rescue them and so God even goes to the extent that he says hey at least rescue your family tell them warn them and this is what happens in verse 14. so a lot rushed out to tell his daughter's fiances quick get out of the city the Lord is about to destroy it but the young men thought he was only joking and that Dawn the next morning the Angels became an insistent hurry they said to lot take your wife and your two daughters who are here get out right now or you will be swept away in the destruction of the city so that there God rescues lot and his family and it says in verse 23 lot reached the village just as the sun was rising over the horizon then the Lord rained down fire and burning sulfur from the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah and he utterly destroyed them along with the other cities in the village in The Villages of the plain wiping out all the people in every bit of vegetation but Lot's wife looked back as she was following behind him and she turned into a pillar of salt very interesting very interesting what we have in the story is God's respecting human will and the thing about God is that he will honor our human our human agency our free will every time what God desires for us is life goodness opportunities Prosperity that's what he he wants for us but if we choose death and push away God he will honor that it's also a great reminder in the story that when God rescues you from something it's important to not look back to keep looking forward keep moving forward take the hand of God and just move it's important for us to read the story through the lens of God who is a god of love through Jesus who is non-violent who is a person who died for his enemies and when we do that we recognize that when we continually choose the path of Destruction what happens is that it forces God to withdraw himself and his protection and allow us to fall under the consequences of our own sin that's not that's not God being mean or judgmental it's simply God getting out of the way and that is when these situations happen but that's not his desire that's not his design the question as the worship team comes up at the end of this story as we read it is how will we respond to the kindness of God the Bible says that it is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance not the Judgment of God not the harshness of God it is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance even when humans going back all the way to Adam and Eve have made poor decisions have disobeyed God God has not given up on us he has not given up on his creation in the Bible we see another story of a similar situation Sodom and Gomorrah it's a city called Nineveh and in this city of Nineveh it was so wicked that God sent a messenger some of you will remember Jonah reluctant prophet he sends them and they don't get you know at least in the text not not the same amount of opportunities they just get one word repent and the whole city repents and God spares them in fact God forgives them so fast that Jonah throws a temper tanter like oh God I knew it I knew it God you are merciful you are loving you are gracious that's why I didn't want to come and preach to these people because God is gracious God is a god of compassion God is a good god would you join me on your feet [Music] the call today is for us to be like Nineveh and not like Sodom and Gomorrah through Jesus God provides for us today the ultimate Escape a way out a way out a way towards life towards God's goodness towards God's mercy in second Peter 3 9 it says something really powerful the Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness instead he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish everyone to come to repentance Sodom and Gomorrah is a story about a patient loving God who desires to see his broken creation restored this is a story about a God who runs into the messiest parts of our lives Corey about the length God will go to in order to restore us story about our God the fact that he is a God who runs to the rescue there's an old hymn that has these very very powerful lyrics the love of God is great or far than tongue or pen can ever tell it goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest health guilty pair bowed down with care God gave his son to win his airing child he reconciled pardoned from his sin God will go to the lowest help reach us and to bring us back to himself as you bow your head with me in prayer today I just want to ask you some final questions first how has God been trying to protect you how has God been trying to reach you in what areas of your life are you struggling to trust God is there perhaps a messy situation where you need God to intervene to rescue you to bring his love and his kindness would you take a moment now and give that over to God would you take a moment now and respond to God I'm going to open up the altars if you need prayer feel free to come up but take a moment now and assess your own life call out to God because he is willing to forgive he is longing to forgive and to restore us sing this final song together", "that was good I can't help but feeling um this is just me I feel a great sense of privilege in being here with you also thank you again Pastor Kurt and Jen for having me I know that I'm not here because you all necessarily need information or you lack examples and practitioners who are doing it you're not I'm not here because you don't hear great teaching or preaching uh I certainly recognize that hanging with this man and this woman for just a few hours that I've been here I've often looked over him and said sure you want me you don't need me you you've already got the coins in the house so I'm I'm I feel a great sense of privilege I want you all to also walk away today if I can just go to the end zone real quick and then bring you back to the 50-yard line because we're halfway there now half time is over everybody's got a little lunch in them we're third quarter but if we go to the end zone you will walk away with a great sense of responsibility and ownership for this you may not have created it you may not have been around when you know Brown versus Board of Education was passed you may not have been around when um you know people of color were locked out of jobs or you know police system you know was with the inequities were created you were not around when people of color were enslaved or Native American land was stolen and taken you don't you're not to blame for that but we're responsible for it so if we all leave today with a sense of responsibility that I the spirit of The Sovereign God is upon me and he has anointed me to walk in Justice do justice love Mercy walk humbly with my God love him all my heart my soul and strength love my neighbor as we love ourselves then we will all have received I believe what God wants us to do this to me this is the new math this is that Euler's method that the church fell asleep on and these places of poverty and pain and plight were created and what we have substituted this with is something far easier that we as Christians we've substituted Justice for reconciliation reconciliation uh you know probably the last 30 40 years has been this big buzzword I remember going to the promise Keepers men's conferences and you know racial reconciliation was the big thing and all these books came out and you know and uh that was the thing reconciliation you know let's just bow your heads grab the hand of the brother next to you he might be a different color but that's your brother and we would you know we'd Sing a Song in English we sing a verse of it in Spanish we sing a verse of it in Swahili right and then hug your brother look at him in the eyes right and then the benediction is pronounced and then that white brother he went back to the suburb and I went back to the hood couldn't go home with him and I had to drive down the street where I got profiled or I didn't have a car and I had to wait an extra 45 minutes to get a bus that only ran twice a day or I had to walk you know so reconciliation is easy reconciliation to me is what happens inside the church inside the building right reconciliation is is is a measure that we have of how many are coming what percentage of this group is here what percentage of that group is here and oh aren't we really reflective of our city and are we really reflected of Revelation 7 9 but Justice is what happened when that black brother leave the building are we just as committed as we were when we were singing Kumbaya and holding hands are his issues or her issues not issues because they're my brother and my sister that's Justice that's what we have a opportunity all to walk in and lean in together so I'm privileged to be here I want to begin this third session by taking you all on more of a personal Journey um just by way of introduction I'm gonna show you a video in a moment um two years ago I made a transition out of my role as the lead pastor of my Assembly of God Church that I had pastored for 28 years and I did that intentionally uh really at the peak the height you know of ministry but I felt a mandate in a compelled call of God to do it so that I could become a voice Catalyst an Awakening voice within the body of Christ because remember that Parable we read while men slept the enemy sold these seeds and uh we went through a succession plan the church is doing great my wife and I were still part of it I serve as the Apostle or the apostolic leader of the church still providing some leadership um but we launched a movement and it's a movement that's designed to awaken the church to do this and when I say church I'm not talking about the building the small Sea church I'm talking about the big sea church I'm talking about the equity I'm talking about you and you and you and you and me all of us right because we are the church and we are in the small Sea church but in a moment the church is going to leave the building the church is going to leave the small Sea church and we are called to be ambassadors of reconciliation and so the movement I want to introduce to you guys by video and it's about two and a half minutes and I'll come back and we'll go a little deeper what's the answer to the race problem what's the answer to the political divide what's the answer to poverty and pain and plight God is calling for his people to be sought to be light and to be and to be leavened and the dark and the dangerous places [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's very common especially in the inner city to see a church on every corner and even though you have churches present there you also have pain and there is no disruption this is a model or picture of a church that's simply in a community that people are driving from a community into that Community into that building for several hours of a worship experience and then they're driving out and all of the resources are spent on what happens to those who are inside the building that church is seen as a fortress it's a safe place from the outside world and if that church ever cease to exist the community wouldn't even notice because Community hasn't benefited or profited from it there's been no disruption of their pain then there's another model of the church and that's a church that those arrows are not just focused inside but they're focused on the outside these are the members that drive into the church but every now and then they do Outreach but they do it on the terms of the church they do it as if we know what's best for the community we don't even take advantage of the resources of the stakeholders of the skills of the talents of the assets that are already present within that community but I believe God's given us a new bottle and it's the with movement the width movement comes alongside of people that are living in these places of pain listens to them learns from them and co-creates with them with people themselves who are indigenous to the community literally taking the lead what I love about Jesus is that his methods were so simple so practical and yet so powerful and I believe that the width movement is in that same pattern and the first way that we seek to do that is through the with connect this is a relational space that's done in real time where you can have all of your questions answered the second space is the with Ministry studio and the studio is the place that that you create and you manifest the dream and vision that's inside of your heart we actually come right alongside of you with expert practitioners and people who are living with movement and in real life with with proven results that help you to bring to fruition the dreams and possibilities that exist for your church and for your community and then the third space is through coaching and through a cohort and so for multiple months we've come alongside of you with these same practitioners to help activate your community because there are gifts and their assets that are already at work within the community and we want to come alongside of you with expert Precision so that missional demonstration and missional discipleship intersect so that what we see is that every community's pain point is disrupted and changed by a disciple-making God is calling for people to be saw all to be light and to be leaven and the darker the dangerous places and every one of those things they transform that which they touch that's what the width moment is it's a mobilization and an activation of the Church of the big sea church that comes to the small Sea church the church leaves the building and goes out into the community transforming every pain Point through a disciple-making movement all right all right thank you let me tell you how this this was born um how many mothers we have here wave your hands who we ought to we ought to give a round of applause to Motherhood because [Applause] much respect to mothers um can't imagine what it's like giving birth physically um but I know what it feels like to give birth to a Dream from God a vision from God it comes painful we learn and we give birth by one or two ways we either Birth by revelation God you told me I receive it I'm gonna go do it but if you don't do it you're gonna learn by tribulation right God's Gonna prepare a fish all right swallow you up you're gonna get there one way or another right but I told you I learned that this Vision was birthed by tribulation on March 6 March 30 I'm sorry August 13th of the year 2016. in Milwaukee Wisconsin my wife and I were at a wedding and then went to the wedding reception it was a beautiful Sunday a Saturday afternoon it was hot and while we were at the wedding reception my phone started blowing up with text messages and social media notifications that there was a growing police presence that was building on our church parking lot armored vehicles you know like SWAT team and uh and the reason was because there was a young black male 23 years old who was shot and killed by a Milwaukee Police Department Officer um three blocks from our church three short blocks sideway blocks and um his body was laying in the in the backyard where he had been running from the police they had to tarp over his body and uh foreign people began Gathering I don't know where they came from but many of them didn't even live in that Community but they heard about it and there was this sense of frustration it was like this was our George Floyd moment the match was lit and thrown on the gas our Ferguson Missouri moment and so that night for several nights part of our city a community called Sherman Park went up in Flames Bank was burned a gas station was burned several other businesses were burned um police cars were burned and flipped over and it was this line police on one side and the Angry Crowd on the other side and now this is a Saturday night and and CNN Fox News I mean MSNBC it's it's national news what's happening in Milwaukee and our local news is picking it up and our pastor so what day comes after Saturday Sunday Sundays are coming what are we going to do it's church tomorrow the choir has been rehearsing the praise team the ushers have been ushering and they're I mean everything's ready for Sunday I'm like man what are we gonna do um I made a decision we're going to have church we communicated it through email social media and so forth um and in fact put up the picture of the family coming out of the funeral this is this brother of the young man who was shot and killed his name is sedan his brother who was shot and killed his name Seville you know his daddy must have liked Cadillacs I mean if you wanna if you want a creative name for your child just ask a black woman she will give you a name for your kid it'll be inspired maybe by the drink she had last night you know Chardonnay or it might be inspired by a perfume or something like that she's gonna give a name to that child sedan and Seville we went down to the to the that Sunday we had abbreviated service we went down to the spot of the unrest and church members were instructed hey dress with jeans and t-shirts bring your shovels bring your brooms bring your gloves bring your garbage bags and bring some bottled water we're going down to the spot of the unrest we're going to clean it up and we're going to engage with the crowd of people who are there because it's still anger it's not over in one day this is the day I met that's the that Sunday was the day I first encountered sedan Smith walking through the crowd of people some who are still had rocks in their hand ready for round two and some who were there with brooms and rakes and he was just walking through man they killed my brother man they killed my brother black man without a shirt pants hanging down you could see part of his underwear he's just you know he's he's just a young person right from the inner city that's part of his culture and uh I'm like man Kyle why you got me here it was it was a it wasn't a sanctuary I'm like man I'm supposed to be in a sanctuary it's Sunday I'm supposed to be preaching my but you got me out here in an intense heated environment um that night Sunday night we knew that there was going to be potential more violence and buildings burned and pastors began texting and calling and saying hey Walter this is in your backyard man what are you gonna do whatever you do we're going to be there with you I said I'll tell you what man well let's let's gather at the church and pray and um and then we're going to walk down to the scene of the unrest again and we're going to engage the crowd at night I mean because you know at night time it really can get wild and so we did we went down and uh the very first night Sunday night the crowd was there they were ready to engage the police again and one of the members of the crowd a young black man he said hey aren't you the pastor from up the street I even know he knew I was I said yeah I'm I'm him you know I didn't know what to do I put my hand in my pocket like yeah I'm him what what what you know what you want um he said why are you here I said I'm here because I love God I love this community and we love you we're not going to see our community go up in flames I said okay okay it's a good answer he said uh another question for you where the hell has the church been he said we have been catching excuse me pastor we have been catching hell in this community for years and the church is not shown up he said we drive past your parking lot every Sunday or take the bus pass your parking lot we see the parking lot full 10 o'clock in the morning until about 12 12 30 and then one o'clock when we go back the parking lot's empty people driving in as long as you're in the building as long as you're a member in the church you got a little bit of Heaven on Earth but when the service is over we leave and every now and then when we come in we say Hey you know school's coming up let's do a backpack school bag giveaway and so we do stuff to and for the community we call that Outreach right like we know what's best we we know your kids are poor they must need some school supplies did we ask them what they need they probably would have said no I don't need no school supplies I need to get my kid out of this school and then another one right but no we're doing stuff to and for you as if we know what's best what you really need where the hell has the church been I said you know what you're right but we're here now and they asked another question say will you be here tomorrow it's like man this is tough I thought this is just going to be easy I can just invite you to church and you know you sit there with me we can sing some songs and we can teach you how to act like a good Christian and you know then you can go back home and I can go back to my house and we come back next Sunday and do it all over again and you know Jesus is going to be coming soon one of these Sundays he might just show up you know just keep coming will you be tomorrow is what he wanted to know and then I had a bunch of white pastors with me during those nights and and somebody else said yeah and I see you white Christians I know y'all y'all here today but I tell you what if a hundred of y'all come back tomorrow I believe in your Jesus so we had about 100 white 101 white people come that next night look for the guy but we didn't find him but we were there the next night and the next night and the next night and the next week and the next week and the with movement was born out of pain and thank you the width movement has the vision of transforming every community's pain Point through a disciple-making movement using business as a tool of justice and unleashing Ordinary People from the small Sea church to be the big sea church and just do it um it doesn't diminish what we do on Sunday but we should come to church on Sunday with Monday and mine you come on Sunday so you can change this on Monday and Tuesday you're on Mission and through the width Movement we have a we have a team and we have a pathway we talked about the connect and the studio the studio is the place you go into like when you got a song on your heart or poetry or a canvas a song you put it on canvas or on vinyl it comes out in the studio the studio is a place where we bring pastors and several members of the leadership or planning team and for a day and a half we help them to understand what is God's sacred story for you for your team for your church and for your community because God has been dancing in this community even before you got here he's been he was waiting for us to leave the building on Sunday morning and come and join him in the dance there's there's a Greek word in ancient Greek words called pericaresis which Perry is the word where we get the word uh perimeter or around carisas is where we get the word choreography pericharesis dance around and that ancient Greek word is a religious word that describes the relationship between the father Son and the Holy Spirit it's a dance of unity and Harmony and Rhythm and and and perfect uh submission father loves the world the father sent the son the son says yes Father I'll go there's no resistance prepare me a body I'll go the son gives his life dies on the cross and the son trusts himself to the father father you know why has Thou forsaken me you know he's falling into the arms of the father when you're dancing right you gotta you gotta trust that your partner gonna be there to catch you right don't flip me and then forget about me right don't dip me and drop me I'm trusting you and then the Father resurrects the Son and the son sends the Holy Spirit ten days later on the day of Pentecost it's a pericaresis it's a Divine dance and God has been Dancing in the Dark Places he's been dancing in the dangerous places and we think that you know it's only in the sanctuary that he's dancing right we get our shout on and we get our pick him up and put them down and you know we join in the dance no God's not just here the gifts are for out there therefore here more than they are for in here and he was inviting us to join him in the dance and it was uncomfortable we were scared one of the other questions they asked me this young man asked me after we you know are you going to be here tomorrow he said one other question preacher why are you allowing the police to use your parking lot to harass us he was looking at this system right here the system that was born out of slave catchers which what really designed for us you know I know now we say it's to protect and to serve but it wasn't protecting and serving us it was catching us it was an incarcerating us right why are you allowing the police to use your lot to harass us now I thank God for blue I think blue lives matter but until black lives matter no life matters right all lives don't matter if black lives don't matter but I realized that he was asking me a question about a system that had historically been oppressive like we watched that video on systemic racism and I had to make a choice because I was I'm gonna be honest with you all and I didn't tell them that that night but you know I saw these buildings going up in flame and I thought to myself well they going they ain't gonna burn down our church because for at least on our lot we safe go ahead and burn the bank down I'll go across town to another bank but my building is going to be up and I had to make a choice I said okay you're right I had to the former police chief's number cell number and I called them that night after I left and I told the young man I said you're right they'll be gone tomorrow and on my way home I called the police chief and I said Chief I know you're just doing your job and you just uh imminent domain I think they didn't ask to use our parking lot they just took it over and I said but Chief we're trying to build relationship and we're trying to restore not only the sense of Peace but shalom in our community and uh appreciate it if you all found another command post for your vehicles oh no problem the next night when me and the pastors met at the church we drove up on the lot there were no police there we walked out to the spot the same crowd was there and the young man said hey preacher I see the police are gone man come on over here and talk to us you are right we were trying to build trust and build shalom so I met Seville Smith I met sedan Smith and uh the guy with the dreads on the right his name is Frank Nitty that's his nickname his real name is since about Frank since about this that's his street name Frank Nitty I feel y'all from Boston Chicago y'all might know some Mobsters names but you know he kind of pitched you know he picked up that that's his street name but we began walking with the Smith family in relationship I know them to this day I get phone calls and emails from sedan and his sister shirelle um you know usually when they want something um but that's okay we were able to help this family to heal and he lost a brother y'all mother lost a son can we just look past what he might have done what his background might have been how he earned it he was a human being he died and people were mourning his loss and we were able to join God in the dance build trust with his family perform the funeral for the family I realized some things during the during the course of the unrest the Knights of the unrest even the funeral not everybody that's in this community wants to see change there's some people that profit off of stuff being broken they exist their livelihood comes from stuff being broken so you trying to fix it you're trying to put me out of a job there's some politicians that don't want to see stuff fixed right they stay in office by stuff being broken that's their campaign I'm gonna fix it wait wait a minute you've been in three terms and you still ain't addressed what you said you was gonna fix that's all right we did the funeral and continued to be a relationship we did a community listening session in our church the week after before I don't know if it was before his funeral it was after the funeral we did a community listening session still trying to bring a sense of Peace because wounds are open and we invited the whole Community to come but we did not allow adults to speak right now so no we're just going to listen to the 25 and under I would so adults they're adults but not you know what I mean we're not listening to the ogs that own property and stuff right because they their interest is their property right like my interest was my building we want to hear from the ones who are really feeling another level of pain like me as a as a pastor I had no idea that this was a culture of people that would never cross the threshold of my church sure they might come to an Outreach every now and then and take a backpack or take a hot dog but they were not going to come and say hey can you tell me about Jesus you know can you teach me how to pray there had to be something radical to happen to shift us to get out to where they were so the community listening session is those kind of folks that came in we want to hear from you we want to listen learn and then take action but listen first listen ask people you know what do you need what do you perceive as the problems as we listen we start hearing things like you know we got dreams and visions and we're artists and where we cook and we dance and we want to start businesses and I got a criminal record so I can't get you know a traditional family supporting wage and so I support myself through pharmaceutical sales and you know are you a pharmacist no I'm not a pharmacist no I'm not you know no no kidding so I'm out on the Green Space the first couple nights of the unrest and I start smelling something that smells like a skunk and I think oh man it's dark out here and it's grass I must have surely I must have stepped in something somebody said oh no Bishop that's that's weed they call it skunk I said what I said I mean I'm from back in the day but I ain't never smelled nothing like this um I was just a new world but we're blind to it because we're in the security of the sanctuary so the community listen session takes place is facilitated by not a pastor but somebody from the community this young man sedan comes in and we had like music hip-hop music on the parking lot bounce house for the kids free food and on the inside uh we had these uh what do they call them tumblers you know Run and Jump and you know off the trampoline and flip and on the mat so this professional group of teens that were tumbling they were there and uh this was like some entertainment going on in the gymnasium and sedan comes in and sees what's going on he says oh Bishop man let me let me let me flip I said wait a minute you flip let's say man these guys are trained they know what they're doing man they got to match they they've been doing this they you know they got a coach he said oh man I've been flipping all my life me and my brother Seville man we used to flip off of garages on mattresses I said okay man you got to sign this waiver first that you're not gonna sue the that's what I wanted to say right because I'm a pastor I'm thinking he said oh man let me go this guy goes out now he comes in he's smelling like a little weed right he he didn't come to flip but he whatever he got on he comes and he runs and he flips bam and he's no hands and no hands and no I'm like this guy should have been in the Olympics I mean and we listen and uh we heard entrepreneurship we heard job creation we heard uh you know we need to get our our records expunged we need I need my driver's license I need I need insurance I'm driving but I don't have insurance I'm driving but I don't have a license you know those kind of practical things uh one of the things that we did in response one of my members you know I talked about the equity of the big sea church making change being disciple makers one of my members his name is Maurice he's about this tall African-American man him and his wife coming to church for 15 years right now today Barack Obama is at his grocery store Barack Obama's in Milwaukee campaigning for some democratic candidates and before I left on Thursday Marie said hey man Barack is coming to the grocery store are you going to be in town said no man I'm going to be in land I'm here but Maurice was with me in the ground on the space where you know the unrest was when they was asking me the questions and as we were walking back one day Marie said Bishop what's your vision I said man I don't know my vision is that the church can somehow begin to buy properties and develop them so we can begin to change some of these systemic things Marie said Bishop I can do that man I'm a real estate developer I said you're a what all I knew him to be was faithful to come to church sit in the back while his wife led the praise dance ministry and write his tie check every month I was like man just keep doing that that's good right when he said I can buy I can I can develop property Maurice caught the vision that I had been carrying pregnant with of Milwaukee's first commercial incubation kitchen for food entrepreneurs food truck owners so directly across the street he bought a building that used to be a barber shop I used to walk across the street get my hair cut I know it's hard to imagine but stay with me all right stay with me stay with don't judge me right I'm close man I'm close I'm holding on to my hairline though man I'm trying he bought it he can we converted it we have an Economic Development Corporation it's now called upstart kitchen 27 licensed food entrepreneurs that are cooking out of that kitchen any schedule they want to is open 24 7. they pay an hourly wage to us they cook their stuff you know it was it's like rotating rack ovens where you can cook 400 cookies in 11 minutes you wish you could do that in your kitchen you can't do that you might get a tray or two in there and it might take you 20 or 30 minutes 400 cookies in 11 minutes I mean cheesecake all kind of Bakers barbecue Korean Wok it was a tater chip man in there making potato chips uh juice kitchens all kind of stuff and these are entrepreneurs each one employing one to three people growing their businesses Maurice bought the building next door to used to be a daycare that did make it through and do the pandemic and it is now called Sherman Park grocery store that's the neighborhood this is a grocery store in the middle of a food desert that's where Barack is coming today with the Secret Service because it's beautiful Justice when you walk to the grocery store the the floor is immaculate it looks like the floor of the The Loft at Stetson right I mean I don't know if y'all ever saw that store you you see that star and you see the floor I'm like man look at the floor I was like we got some other stuff in here Bishop oh okay but man I just the floor and it's fruit fresh fruits and vegetables as green as prior to that people were buying their stuff at the gas station kids are getting their breakfast on the way to school at the gas station a red soda and a bag of flaming hot chips that's my protein I'm going to school now now you expect me to perform maybe that's why there's High expulsion and uh suspension rates so this beautiful grocery store in the middle of a food desert beautiful Justice right let's go upstream and find out who's throwing these people in the river the with movement is designed to do that we come alongside of churches in this ministry Studio we help them imagine new possibilities not how to have a better worship service not to have a better children's ministry but how do you make disciples in the marketplace and how do you unleash the the marketplace leaders to be disciple makers and to be Transformers of community where they live work and play and we do that through the national black Fellowship which sponsors the with movement through the ministry Studio and then invite those pastors to take that blueprint that they've created in the studio and Walk It Out by coaching and in a cohort community that's what I that's what I left the church full time to do uh and I'm privileged to be here today so", "for East Coast International Church you guys good cool all right you guys got the energy too first service was pretty good too normally I always got something to say in second service about for service but you guys are matching the energy this morning it's good to be with you guys today my name is Jesse lado I'm the youth and media Pastor here at East Coast International [Applause] Church and I have the pleasure of continuing this awesome series we've been in going through the Book of Genesis uh the last couple weeks we've heard some awesome messages by both Pastor David and Pastor Tanisha so if we can give it up for them thank you we learned about protecting the promise God has over us we learn about how we are seen and sought after by God as we wait for the promise and today I want us to go ahead and fast forward in Genesis to one of the biggest wrestling matches in history the person we're going to really focus in on today is Jacob everybody say Jacob Jacob and his fight with none other than God did you guys know that God God throws down too man if you if you test him he might do it but and here we see it exactly that whole that whole entire exchange takes place it's real I promise but what we know about Jacob is that he's the son of Isaac right and Isaac's the son of Abraham and before Jacob was born a promise was given to his parents Isaac and Rebecca during the beginning years of their marriage you see they were not able to have kids so Isaac pleaded with God to have a child and God answered Isaac's prayer and gave them not just a child but a set of twins all right while Rebecca was pregnant though she always felt like her twins were fighting in her belly man like just always like had it out for each other and and so she prayed to God one day and was just like dude what is going on in my belly right now like they keep fighting together and God told her the sons in your womb will become two nations from the very beginning the two Nations will be Rivals One Nation will be stronger than the other and your older son will serve your younger son when it came time for Rebecca to give birth the first twin to be born was Esau you see uh we've learned that in in scripture right uh uh the names that are given to people are often times described who they are as a person right or or describe the moment that something amazing took place right like the God who sees me or or whatever it might be but for Esau the reason why they named him Esau was because he was Harry that's it that's all it was like Harry with the h a i r y like not that's it and he had red hair I don't know that they call him Esau because of that I guess they didn't think too much into it but I'm sure that dude got bullied in school cuz that is a mess up name but right behind Esau right after he was born was Jacob and the Bible says that as Jacob was coming out he was holding on to the heel of Esau which is how Jacob got his name which means holder of the heel So based off of what God had promised to Rebecca and Isaac Jacob would rule over his older brother Esau which actually went against the culture of the time because the firstborn son was the one that inherited the father's wealth and estate the firstborn son was the one that theoretically ruled over the other siblings and the conflict that we see here between the two children is that their father Isaac loved Esau more the reason why was because you see Esau knew how to hunt and he would always bring home some good animals that they would cook up and Isaac Lov to eat all of that um that Esau brought and so he loved them that for that that's it you know I mean I'm sure there were other great things about Esau but that's what the Bible calls out and while Esau was the skillful Hunter who had favor with his dad Jacob was just a dude with a quiet temperament who stayed at home kind of doing home chores stuff and he was also the son whom their mom Rebecca loved more and so we have this like divided home situation and and she probably favored um Jacob more because God told her that Esau Esau would ultimately serve him right so it kind of Mak makes sense but we you should also know about Jacob is that his name has another meaning and the other meaning is supplanter which is to deceive this definition is also very fitting to Jacob and here's why from the jump whether he was unaware of God's promise to Rebecca or just didn't believe that God's promises were true for him Jacob often deceived his way into his own blessings you see Jacob tricked his brother who actually had the birthright by cultural standards into giving that Birthright away in exchange for a meal that's all it was Esau came home hungry one day saw that Jacob had some steak and cheese with fries and was like dude let me get some of that and then Jacob was like I got you I need your birth right though and he gave it away and then later Rebecca their mom plotted with Jacob to trick Isaac and and have Jacob steal the blessing that was supposed to be given to Esau so pretty much what what ended up happening was was that Isaac told Esau hey I need you to go ahead and get me some food make me the stew that I love because I want to go ahead and bless you Rebecca heard this and told Jacob listen your dad's about to bless Esau right now so what I need you to do is go to the farm get two animals and I need you to cook it up I'll make the stew that I know that he likes you give it to him pretending to be Esau that was blind so he he couldn't tell but then Jacob was like bro Esau is hairy how the heck am I going to get away with that so the animals that they used to make the stew they put on him and had this whole exchange and Jacob tricked Isaac into giving him Esau's blessing and this all resulted in Esau wanting to kill Jacob cuz he stole not only his Birthright but his Blessing All That was supposed to be given to him and so Rebecca hearing Esau plot this whole thing in in and on his own about how he's going to go after Jacob and all these things she hears this and goes to was like dude you got to go because your brother wants to kill you and if you stay here for another second I might not see you anymore so go to my brother's house and and there just stay there until things settle down and so Jacob is now on his journey to see his uncle and in that Journey he had a vision and in that Vision God gave him a promise and said that the ground you are lying on belongs to you I am giving it to you and your descendants your descendants will be as numerous as the dust of the earth they will spread out in all directions to the west and the east East to the North and the South and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants what's more I am with you and I will protect you wherever you go one day I will bring you back to this land and I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you the land that Jacob was running from in fear that his brother was about to kill him God said would be his that's kind of a wild promise when you look at it in the moment and and when Jacob woke up from this Vision he said if God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey and if he will provide me with food and clothing and if I return safely to my father's home then the Lord will certainly be my God and even though we see Jacob having this like amazing exchange with God hearing directly from God himself about all that he promised to do to Jacob and through Jacob and it must have been an amazing exchange but still after this whole thing happened he still tried to deceive his way to Blessings when Jacob reached his destination and he would meet his match and his uncle lean because what would happen is they would spend the next number of years having a tennis match of deception going back and forth with one another just to give a quick summary you see when Jacob arrived he saw Uncle lean's daughter and was like dude she is beautiful I got to have her her name was Rachel everybody say Rachel Rachel we don't got to talk about why he wants a cousin we whatever we'll just ignore that right now but he was in love with lean's younger daughter Rachel and wanted her hand in marriage so he goes to his uncle and says I want to marry Rachel and he says that's cool I I'll let you do that you got to work for me for seven years before you do that right some of us man man we got to we got to we got to be better man cuz seven years is crazy cuz that's exactly what Jacob did and he ends up having this whole wedding this ceremony and and the next day he wakes up he looks to his left and realizes bro this is not Rachel it's it's her sister Leah and so he gets out of bed goes to his uncle and was like dude you said you would give me Rachel why do I have Leah sitting in bed next to me and and and uncle was like well man like don't you know that over here we don't give the younger daughter first we always give the older daughter first and so Jacob was like whatever man what do I have to do to get Rachel and Uncle lean says that's just work another seven years for me so that's what Jacob did he my man work 14 years for Rachel she must have been an awesome person I guess right and and he was deceived through through working many years for laan uh through these exchanges but he was also deceiving laan back because during this time he was able to take much of lean's herds of animals with him he was able to develop wealth for himself and after 20 years of being on the Run God directs Jacob to return to the land of his father the land that he promised him the problem with that though is that Jacob will have to face Esau the brother who last he heard wanted to kill him and on this journey back to the land of his father Isaac Jacob kind of devises a plan together he says all right I'm gonna get all these things I'm gon put him gets a couple Messengers he say hey I need you to take all of these things to my brother tell him I'm his servant like if we can squash the beef I know I stole your birth right and your blessing I'm sorry right take these things and and hopefully things will be good so he sends his Messengers out they go they meet with Esau the Esau has the exchange with the Messengers The Messengers come back to Jacob and he was like well he's like so we told him what you said Jacob was like cool did you give him everything yeah now what he said he's coming to meet you and Jacob was probably like oh great but then they were like but he's also has an army of 400 men and I would imagine in this moment that Jacob's face just went full on white his heart sank couldn't feel his fingertips he was just like what in the world is going on my life is over and and full of fear and distress Jacob strategically starts dividing his people and possessions into these two groups in case things go south at least one can get away and he stays behind and prays this prayer in Genesis 32 starting at verse 9 it says that then Jacob prayed oh god of my grandfather Abraham and God of my father Isaac oh Lord you told me return to your um own land and to your relatives and you promise me I will treat you kindly I am not worthy of all the unfailing love and faithfulness you have shown me your servant when I left home and crossed the Jordan River I owned nothing except a walking stick now my household fills two large camps oh Lord please rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau I am afraid that he is coming to attack me along with my wives and children but you promise me I will surely treat you kindly and I will multiply your descendants until they become as numerous as the Sands along the seashore too many to count he spent the night there and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau and here we see Jacob pleading with God right praying to God asking God to come through for him trying to remind him of all those promises he made all those years ago like hey God remember you told me you're going to do all this I need you to do it now because right now the predicament that Jacob found himself in the chance of Esau coming to kill him was far more real to him than the promises that God had made to be with him and and we see what has been the pattern of Jacob's life after this prayer after asking for help after asking for God to come through even after the prayer he still tries to scheme his own way to the promises we see him trying to get more gifts to bribe his brother maybe with these things he'll spare my life instead of trusting the God he was just praying to for the majority of Jacob's life up to this point it seems as if he didn't trust God with the promises that were set over him and out of this distrust and and out of this unbelief he tried to create them for himself he tried to create a blessing for himself deceiving his brother twice he tried to create multiplication and prosperity and his life for himself causing him to marry two sisters who were in constant tension with each other because the problems that Jacob faced seemed more real to him than the promises of God Jacob decided to do things his way to try to get to the promise and all it did was create more problems more fear more confusion and more discouragement because Jacob tried to do things his own way we see that he wasn't as close to the promise as he thought but rather his actions were causing him to wander away from the promise In This Moment his Birthright and the blessing he stole from Esau didn't matter all his possessions and family he grew while being on the Run didn't matter none of it it mattered because Jacob's back was against the wall as his brother who was determined to kill him all these years ago was headed straight towards him not by himself but with a whole entire Army the question for us though this morning is what do we do when our present problems are more real to us than God's promises for our lives what happens when the chaos is more evident to us than the promise of his peace when the lack in our lives is more evidence to us than the promise of his provision and blessing when the weight of anxiety and loneliness is more evident to us than the promise of his presence I'm not saying that these problems aren't real but what happens when we're in a place where based off what we're going through we're just having a hard time believing in the promises of God for our lives I think if we're not careful we have the tendency to fall into the temptation of Jacob and try to force God's promises for ourselves we make rash decisions to see provision in our lives we make unwise choices to find peace in our lives we go through unwanted territories to try to find fulfillment in our lives we go ahead trying to force his promise into our lives and when we reach the end of the road of doing things our way we find ourselves very similarly to Jacob in more fear more distress more confusion finding ourselves wandering from the things of God but it was when Jacob was at the end of himself that God met him in a rather unusual way Genesis 32 says in verse 22 that during the night Jacob got up and took his two wives his two servant wives and his 11 sons and crossed the jaic river with that's a big family man but after taking them to the other side he sent over all of his possessions this left Jacob all alone in the camp and a man came and wrestled with him until the dawn began to break when the man saw that he would not win the match he touched Jacob's hip and wrenched it out of its socket then the man said let me go for the Dawn is Breaking but Jacob said I will not let you go unless you bless me what is your name the man asked he replied Jacob your name will no longer be Jacob the man told them from now on you you will be called Israel because you have fought with God and with men and have won please tell me your name Jacob said why do you want to know my name the man replied then he blessed Jacob there Jacob named the place pineal which means face of God for he said I have seen God face to face yet my life has been spared the sun was Rising as Jacob left pineal and he was limping because of the injury to his hip amen I'm sure after planning and and and trying to get all these things together to maybe maybe might survive this just strategically putting his family all over the place I'm sure after worrying about what might happen to him the last thing that he wanted to do when he was alone at night was for someone to come over there and pick up a fight with him I'm sure my man just wanted to sleep and rest hoping that something changes but here we see that a man came and picked up a fight with him I'm sure all of the frustration was built uh the frustration that was built in Jacob was just let out in this moment as he just went crazy on his dude like hitting that guy with the onews and everything right and and when the man saw that oh wow Jacob like this dude is not giving up the Bible says that he touched his hip and it caused it to go out of its socket and what it's really saying right it says touch but what's really happening is that that Jacob got punched like really really hard that his hip got like dis jointed and all that stuff it was actually pretty gruesome than what the Bible says right now but it says that even after that Jacob still kept on holding saying I will not let go until you bless me the reason why he would not let go is because Jacob began to realize that this was not some ordinary dude trying to pick a fight with him it was God you see Last year me and a a couple friends went skiing and it was the first time for me I've never gone skiing before and by the end of the day it would be the last time never going back all right any skiers in the room skiers crazy people man I swear I'll pray for you it's wild right if you've never been skiing though there's difficulties to each Trail or Mountain that that each place has and and correct me if I'm wrong but if you're a beginner right you you really spend your time on like the green circle Trails right that's like for the amateurs there's also one in particular that's like really the beginning beginning beginning stages that it's just this little slope that just like whoop that's it it's just a little tiny slope and they call it like Bunny Hill that's where I was spent all my time all right I was just on Bunny Hill going down and and we were at the ski spot spending hours of our day here we went nowhere else I kind of like took this time when I was going down Bunny Hill to learn how to like sway a little bit to the left and to the right right and then kind of learn y'all ever heard of the pizza you go like that you know I did the pizza I learned how to do the pizza right and and we were just doing that the whole time just going down the tail going down to Hill going down to Hill and when the day was wrapping up one of my friends were like bro we went down this bunny Hill thing like 10 times and we didn't fall once all right let's go to the next one up you can deaf do it like I believe in you now mind you this dude never skied before either he was a firsttimer just like I was he was in no place to give me any sort of suggestions but for some reason man he he hyped me up man he hyped me up gave me the confidence I needed to just go up to this Trail and this Trail was a a blue square right which is kind of more for experienced people I think right uh but I didn't care man I went down Bunny Hill 10 times without falling I scared of nothing right and and so we get to this Trail they have these ski lifts that bring you to the top of the of the hill and we get on the ski LIF with my friend and the third guy hops in and we just start talking with him and we come to find out this dude like skied for Team USA years ago and he's now retired and he just comes to these spots to just spend his pastime now the fact that an X Team USA ski is about to go down the same Trail as me right who just started this today immediately told me that I made a terrible decision like Jesse I don't know what you just decided to like put yourself in but you are in trouble and so we just told him like dude it's our first day skiing what advice do you have for us going down this hill man and he asked what well can you guys stop and I was like the pizza count I can do pizza and he was like no like pizza does not count you're going fast here and I was like I can't stop I don't know how to stop then he as well can you sway side to side and and I was on Bunny Hill swaying side to side so I was like D bro like that's that's a dumb question why you ask me that and he was like well if you say if you sway side to side then at least you can maintain speed and not not go out of control so I was like cool at this point of this whole exchange it was time for me to hop off the lift and I hopped off the lift I tripped my ski thing came off my left foot ate the snow and then I already knew in that moment I was like dude this is another sign that you should not be doing this but what did I do I got up I clipped my leg back on that ski and I kept going cuz I was too prideful man and and so so I'm at the top of this hill I'm kind of like inching my way forward to like you know the starting point and all I'm able to see is is my feet what's around me and the end like the middle is just like it's just dry and I and I was like dude this is not going to be good and so what I decided to do just taking what the guy told us I was like you know what if I start all the way on the right side and kind of angle myself to go left then at least I could just start turning back and then like you know then I'll I'll be good so I just went and I started to ski down and things were actually going to plan I'm not going to lie for about 7.3 seconds until I realized a couple things number one I actually didn't know how to move side to side cuz I I was trying to nothing was happening all right the pizza wasn't working okay I tried do pizza and I almost fell right and I kept going faster and faster and faster I didn't know how to stop and the next thing you know I'm going straight down in One Direction going so fast I literally didn't feel the feet I mean the snow under my feet like I may have been floating or I may have been doing a ski wheelie is that a thing ski wheelies I think I was doing a ski wheelie I don't know but I was going fast dude I've never felt more out of control in my life than in this moment because I couldn't control how fast I was going I couldn't control how I wanted to stop I couldn't control where I wanted to go it was just me and my ski Poes and I refused to fall man because up to that point look I I'm 25 I was 24 at the time I never broke a bone in my in my life I've been pretty good with that and I was not about to start on that day cuz if I fell ER was the only place I was going to after there's no way around it and so I I took these skap poles right it's supposed to be like some sort of like to help you balance to kind of navigate and I held on as tight as I could and I remember I just started praying out loud I was like God please don't let this be the first time I break a bone man I've been so good up to this point please let me get home to my wife man I miss her right now and please God don't let there be anyone in front of me cuz if there is then I'm definitely not going home to my wife today right and then after that I don't know what I was pranking I just started speaking Tong man I was so scared I just I kept going and and I remember as after holding on as tight as I could refusing to fall I got to the end of the slow where I started to be able to slow down cuz my pizza started to work a little bit but my friend on the other hand he kept going and there's these little poles where you can like kind of Park your skis and he tried to grab onto that looped around fell he's fine he didn't get hurt or anything but it was it was kind of funny but yeah man but that was crazy but in a moment right where I felt completely out of control where it seemed like the ER was my destination where there was nothing that could be done I did the only thing I could actually do in that moment and it was to hold on to hold on to my ski the only sense of safety and certainty that I had and not let go until I reached the place that I wanted to go and I just could have imagine that Jacob found himself in this position when he realized that it was God that he was wrestling he held on his life is seemingly coming to an end his family is at risk of being in danger all that he has with him is about to be lost and here we see Jacob completely lost in control doing all he could do holding on and unless his circumstances were changed unless he received God's blessing he was determined to hold on and not let go no matter how long it took and no matter how challenging it was and it was at that moment where Jacob decided to hold on where we see him finally submit to God and realize that it's only God who can bless and we see that's when Jacob became blessed not with the fabricated blessings he tried to create along the way but with the blessing that was promised to him this whole time by God because it was here that Jacob stopped holding on so hard to the promise and instead decided to hold on to the promis keeper it was here where he stopped trying so hard to hold on to the blessings that he had stolen and he started holding on to the one who could bless him and we see that blessing take place in the next chapter because Jacob finally goes face to face with Esau and rather than meeting him with a wrestling match fighting for his life we see them meeting with a warm embrace and this exchange right here this wrestling match between Jacob and God is this is our response for us when we find ourselves in moments where we're doubting the promises where we're confused over the promises and the moments where our present problems are more real to us than God's promises these are not the moments where we Wander from God to do things our way but here we see that those are the moments where we need to wrestle with God and how we wrestle with God Is by holding on to him as we navigate those doubts those questions and those discouragements but what we learn here is that sometimes holding on to God will feel more like a wrestling match than a warm embrace but these are the moments where the transformation takes place you see in this whole interaction God had with Jacob he initiated the wrestling match he picked up a fight with Jacob Jacob didn't want any of this my man just wanted to sleep and and he didn't initiate this wrestling match to to to give some sort of like egotistical message that hey Jacob I just want to let you know I'm stronger than you even though he is but he initiated the match to bring awareness to Jacob's life to show him that the blessing was actually found in the wrestling what we learned from this wrestling match is that when you wrestle with God your identity in Jesus is more revealed you see the last time Jacob's name was asked was when his father asked him to name himself you know when he put like goat skin on himself to act like he was his hairy brother and his blind dad was like hey who are you and he said I'm Esau so that he can steal a blessing which is living up to that name Jacob he would lie he would deceive himself but here when God says what is your name he responds by saying not Esau but he says no I'm Jacob essentially saying I'm the deceiver I'm the robber I'm the cheater I'm the holder of the heel that's been doing anything in my power to get my own way no matter who I hurt that's who I am and Jacob lived up to what he thought was his identity but here God says you will no longer be dictated by your deception you will no longer be Jacob but Israel the name that would represent not him but a whole nation meaning to struggle with God because he has fought with man and with God and won in his wrestling match Jacob was given a new identity and it was an identity that wasn't found in his deceitful ways or in his sin but an identity that was found in Christ and who God says he is the very same way we have a new identity in Christ no longer being bound to our sin defined by our shortcomings but identified as Victors in Jesus when you wrestle with God your perspective on Jesus has changed Jacob would identify God as the god of his grandfather Abraham and and the god of his father Isaac you see God like um not Abraham but Jacob always believed in God but not his God Jacob always believed in the existence of God but he was never personal he was just a god of his and in the moment of surrender we see that is God too that it was no longer just the god of my grandfather and my father but because God Jacob work because God had a moment with Jacob we see too it was here where his perspective was changed that the blessing and and the promise it's not in the provision but it's the access that Jacob now has to the provider the the blessing and the promise is it's not in receiving good things but it's Jacob now being able to have relationship with The Giver of all good things the wrestling changes our perspective on Jesus because what happens is many times when we're so stuck on holding on to the blessings and the promises alone we'll do whatever we can to see that blessing take place even if it's at the expense of making the wrong decisions in our lives but in our wrestling when we learn to take a hold of God we're doing whatever we can not to see the Promise or blessing take place but doing whatever we can to not let go of the God who has made those promises to us when we wrestle your walk with Jesus is different we see that when Jacob refused to surrender to God he got hit in the hip K get to come out of its socket leaving Jacob walking with a limp now and the reason why this is important is because from what we've learned about Jacob he's always been a runner he's always ran away from his problems he ran away from his brother he ran away from his uncle but now with his limp he can't run anymore as his brother's approaching Jacob is hit with his limp forcing him to confront the very thing he's been running from all these years Jacob could no longer do what he's done in the past he could no longer live a life of walking in his old ways he now has to walk differently the limp was was was not a punishment but a reminder of who God is a reminder of what he can do and a reminder of what Jacob could not do on his own because though the limp may have slowed him down because God was now able uh was now with Jacob God is able to take him further than Jacob could ever go on his own with strengthen legs wrestling with God will change our walk it might break us in a way that will no longer allow us to walk in our old ways it may leave us with a limp it may leave us feeling vulnerable but the good news is is that God's power is made perfect in our weak weak nness this is why the Apostle Paul says that's why I take pleasure in my weakness and in the insults hardships persecutions and troubles that I suffer for Christ for when I am weak then I am strong worship team you can come on up the story teaches us that sometimes God has promises for us that are hard to believe sometimes God has promises for us that based off what we're going through right now it's just like yeah there's no way this can happen like everything is at an odd right now some sometimes it feels like the enemy is just always winning sometimes we don't get what God is doing and sometimes we wonder if he's doing anything at all and I want to reassure you today that it's okay to feel that way if this story of Jacob shows us anything is that God isn't scared of those things as a matter of fact he invites it God didn't have to wrestle with Jacob all night he could have just left him there stranded he could have just come in pop his hip call it a day be on his way but in his loving patience he did what was necessary to bring about transformation into Jacob's life am so whatever promise or blessing you find yourself struggling to believe today my plea to you is that you would not wander into your own way but rather you would wrestle with God through your doubts through your fears through your worries and your questions wrestle with him by holding on to him in prayer and through his words hold on to him just like I did with those ski Poes not knowing what's going to happen but I'm just going to hold on until something changes or or holding on like Jacob not letting go until you get that blessing it's there that Genesis 32 says that Jacob won when he held on where he got the Victory and it's there where we will have the victory in our lives as well the wrestling will change how you see yourself it'll change how you see God and and it'll change how you walk it may even leave you with a limp that reminder that you can't do it by yourself and I don't know what that limp will look like for you but here's what I do know it's that a limp with God will take you a lot further in this life than strengthen legs on your own could ever amen let's stand you know God will he he'll sometimes make us wrestle him for some blessings and and promises and he makes us wrestle not because he doesn't want to bless us it's because just like Jacob there's more blessings in the wrestling than without it because there would be no Jacob to Israel without the wrestling there would be no uh uh the god of my to my god without the wrestling Jacob may still have been able to run off into his old ways without the wrestling and Jacob would not have learned to submit to God without the wrestling you see I grew up with an older brother and we would fight all the time all the time and when we would fight the last thing I'd want to do was submit I did everything in my I don't care how strong or tall he was I did everything in my power to make sure it was my brother who quits because the moment I submit right I lose but with God it's a little bit different because wrestling with God is the only match that you'll ever have where you'll actually win in the moments you lose with [Music] [Applause] them and it's because it's at the place of submission where you see his blessings begin to take place in your life and so God will meet you in your fears and in your doubts and in your confusions but with Genesis 32 tells us that he may not meet you in the way you would expect so what blessing do you need this morning morning what promise are you having a hard time believing for your life whatever it might be I invite you to spend some time here at the altars and wrestle as the worship team sings this last song thank you", "is our holy week podcast this week we're going to be taking a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it [Music] today is tumultuous tuesday that's what i'm calling it tumultuous tumultuous tuesday it's a pretty intense day during holy week in the life of jesus and so we're going to talk about all of what happened on tuesday it seems like there was a lot of almost like arguments and confrontations happening on this day and really kind of i don't know i imagine jesus stress levels were pretty high i mean we know that they were really high right because he he's about to die he's about to die he knows he's about to die he sweats blood on on friday night no oh no no that's when he dies that's friday thursday night two nights from now he's going to sweat blood that's the stress so today is a pretty stressful day for jesus um hopefully it's not a stressful day for you as you're listening but if it is just know that hey jesus had stressful days too and we're gonna get through them together and enjoy reading a little bit about how jesus handled himself on those days so that's good to start off first thing in the morning a bleary-eyed disciple you know rolling off of probably their maths where they were sleeping on the floor somewhere get ready for a long day of ministry and work they're about to do that two mile walk into jerusalem again from bethany to go spend time at the temple teaching and along their um pathway they pass they cross the path of the fig tree that they saw yesterday yeah the fig tree that jesus was angered with yesterday and cursed and that we talked about a little bit yesterday about the symbolism of what that meant and kind of what was happening in that moment but so just to start the day off here's the fig tree why don't you read the passage christina from mark all right so we're at mark 11 verses 20 to 25. the next morning as they passed by the fig tree he had cursed the disciples noticed it had withered from the roots up peter remembered what jesus had said to the tree on the previous day and exclaimed look rabbi the fig tree you cursed has withered and died then jesus said to the disciples have faith in god i tell you the truth you can say to this mountain may you be lifted up and thrown into the sea and it will happen but you must really believe it will happen and have no no doubt in your heart i tell you you can pray for anything and if you believe that you've received it it will be yours but when you are praying first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against so that your father in heaven will forgive your sins too awesome thank you so this is what i what i'm calling this week one of the little jesus nuggets along the way nice jesus is he knows what's about to happen he knows that his time on earth is coming to a close for now and he's beginning to really proactively share things with his disciples and you can almost kind of see in the way the gospels record so much from this one week and in the way that jesus was sharing so many teachings with them and prophecies with them and doing so many things like you can kind of see him ramping up almost like this sense of like urgency of like man i got i just gotta teach them everything that i can i gotta get everything in while i can while i have the opportunity and so here he is his faith has challenged the disciples and they're confronted with the reality of the power of jesus faith and the power of his words and they're kind of baffled by it and jesus is just saying yeah like listen that's not just something that i can do you know he's not just like yeah i am god guys obviously i can wither a tree with my very words he's like no actually this isn't amazing that i did it what's amazing is that you can do it too that's awesome yeah so jesus is saying here like faith is powerful it's not just for me it's for my disciples wow and i love the mark passage too because it includes that one verse that says um when you're praying first forgive anyone you're holding a grudge against so that your father in heaven will forgive your sins too and that little piece is so powerful as well not only is jesus saying like faith is powerful he's also saying unforgiveness is powerful when you're wrestling with unforgiveness in your heart it is it that has the capacity to block the power and the flow of prayer yeah which is crazy to think about um and so he's basically saying unforgiveness is an enemy of faith and it's an enemy of god's will and you need to make sure that you handle it unforgiveness is powerful too but it's not for my disciples so just a reminder and let that be a challenge to you it's certainly a challenge to me every time i read a verse about unforgiveness i'm always like oh god like help me check my heart because i don't want to be dwelling in unforgiveness i need your help to be dealing with any bitterness and any um you know whatever that might be any grudges that i might be holding or whatever um so i think that's such an important thing for us to do and that's exactly we have to keep a healthy heart yeah exactly healthy heart so that's the first challenge of the day on tumultuous tuesday so that's on their way into the temple on their way into jerusalem and jesus and the disciples go to show up again at the temple and continue his kind of week of teaching at the temple he did this monday and now tuesday he's doing it again and what we find is that in the midst of jesus spending his day teaching the people who were around and in and out of the temple area he has a bunch of showdowns while he's teaching because the pharisees the sadducees the religious teachers are really like frustrated by his presence and frustrated by what he's doing and so we're just gonna look into a bunch of these um showdowns that happen and kind of gloss over them pretty quickly because there is a lot of content here guys if you look at if you're following along with your bible reading today there's a lot to read hopefully you just pick one of the gospels to read because if you read all four it's gonna take a lot of time which you're welcome to do if you got the time but um so we're gonna kind of go quickly here but one of the first things that happened was that uh the pharisees came to jesus and they were like listen jesus what authority like what what do you think gives you the right to be talking about all of these things that you're talking about well you know where do you get the idea that you have the right to be saying all the things you're saying because remember when jesus taught it wasn't just like hey here's a cool life lesson for you like it's like the stuff he just said to the disciples like oh yeah not only can i you know wither trees with my curses but you can too right and he's saying this kind of like crazy like he just assumes this position of authority like he just walks in and assumes it yeah it's great yeah it's awesome and yeah the disciples not the disciples the disciples are challenged by it but the pharisees are enraged yeah they're enraged and everybody notices too like there are different comments throughout the gospels that say people like were amazed by his teaching because he taught with such authority unlike the religious teachers of his day so jesus style is in stark contrast to the religious teachers who didn't have this kind of power yeah so anyways they're like what makes you think you can do this and jesus says i'll answer your question if you answer my question i love this part and he goes do you think that john the baptist was from god or was his ministry just a human thing and man i love it because at the heart of what the pharisees were trying to do is they were trying to turn the crowd against jesus right the pharisees were trying to catch him in a in a moment where he was in a public place speaking on a public platform and they were trying to turn the crowd against him yeah because they were trying to get him to come out come right out and talk about his authority and his greatness and he was he wasn't going to fall for it so he's like you want to turn the crowd against me let's see how that goes for you this crowd responded in repentance to the ministry of john the baptist so do you think that came from god or not and then they go have their little powwow together to discuss their answer yeah yeah and they decide that they're unwilling to respond so there's a little thing and then jesus is frustrated so he's responding to them and he's like you know what let me tell you a parable and he tells a story of two sons and basically the point is sinners the ones who say they're not going to follow god are actually entering god's kingdom faster than the pharisees it's really really kind of intense it's like peop you know there's a son who says no father i won't do what you say but then goes and does it yeah and then there's a son that says yes father i'll do everything you say and then goes and doesn't do it and he's like look at these people that you condemn these sinners they're the ones who yes maybe they had a lifestyle that was against god but now they're responding to him yeah and that's pleasing to god and you are not so the pharisees knew he's talking about them right right he tells another parable about a vineyard and this guy who owned a vineyard and had evil tenants and how he sent his servants and eventually his son to collect the rent but they wouldn't pay him and instead they started killing all his servants and eventually they killed his sons um and he's basically saying you know what do you think that the ten the landlord is gonna do when he comes to the tenants yeah and the pharisees are like yeah that's a horrible thing i can't believe that happened he's definitely gonna like deal with those tenants he's gonna kill them or something you know and um jesus responds and is like yep exactly you're exactly right and just look some dead in the eye like it's like this showdown moment i love how they always respond to his his parables his stories like with pretty much the right answer but then he flips it on them and they're like oh yeah thank you for proving my point yeah so jesus asked the pharisees didn't you ever read this scripture the stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone this is the lord's doing and it is wonderful to see i tell you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit so jesus is really calling out the pharisees uh directly yes hardcore as as he has been um and this is a this is a quote from psalm 118 and so basically a cornerstone is the building that builders use they would set the cornerstone they would choose it and then they would build the whole building around that cornerstone it would kind of help um with the layout of the building so to say and so the symbolism is that the builders have rejected a stone for building with but then that stone becomes the cornerstone the most important stone for the whole building and so i want to read a passage from first peter 2 i'm going to go forward to go back because 1st peter 2 also quotes psalm 118 so it's first peter 2 verses 4 to 7 as you come to him the living stone rejected by humans but chosen by god and precious to him you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood hood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ for in scriptures it says see i lay a stone in zion a chosen and precious cornerstone and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame and that's quoting isaiah 28 16 and then he says now to you who believe this stone is precious but to those who do not believe the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone and so uh peter is kind of setting up the contrast between the people who who do believe and the people who don't and in matthew jesus is saying the the pharisees are these people that the psalmists talk about that reject the cornerstone that they're they're blinded to the importance of of this symbolic stone wow yeah so he was so direct and the showdown is just incredible there's just one verse i wanted to highlight where he says the kingdom of god will be given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit and for me when i read that it just i just find myself praying god i want to produce the proper fruit yeah god i want to produce the proper fruit god help me to be the the nation the people how many to be part of your kingdom and help me to produce the proper fruit i want to make sure that my faith is in you that i am believing that i'm responding to who you are appropriately and that my life reflects that then jesus went on to tell another parable he told a story about a great wedding feast and how all of the guests of honor decided they were too busy to attend and so then they just went out and invited anyone and everyone to the wedding feast and all sorts of people came which is again another parable really sh like directly calling out the pharisees as those quote unquote guests of honor who were too busy to attend the wedding feast to celebrate jesus coming so so that showdown happens jesus continues his day teaching and then there's yet another showdown that happens when it says the pharisees went away and they came up with a strategy it says uh they sent spies pretending to be honest men i can't remember maybe luke said that but those are the those are the exact words they sent spies pretending to be honest men to listen to jesus teaching and come up with a difficult question that would try to stump him and so last time they were trying to turn the crowd against him now they're trying to turn the romans against him so they asked him a question about taxes and whether or not taxes should be given to caesar and it's just a trap and jesus once again outsmarts them all out foxes them all and shuts them down and gives an impossible an impossibly brilliant and deep answer for which there is no like response um so that failed and then moving on the sadducees then come in which is another jewish religious sect and they want to challenge jesus on his theology so they're trying to give give this theolo theological challenge to him and jesus once again he shuts them down and not only does he answer their question but he also in his rebuttal speaks to one of the most central errors theological errors that the sadducees had which was that the sadducees didn't believe in anything supernatural they didn't believe in life after death they didn't believe in angels or demons they were just all about kind of the here and now this is how we're supposed to live we're jewish people we follow these laws and jesus speaks to them about the truth of resurrection which i imagine must have hit him pretty hard knowing that like i'm about to die and then come back to life yeah so like yeah let me deal with you on this because you're asking me a stupid question about marriage you know that really isn't the real point let me get to the heart of the issue yeah and i love the way that he deals with it because first of all he's he basically tells them you're like your problem is you don't understand the scriptures like you're not reading them you're not looking at it and he quotes exodus 3 6 where god is moses is at the burning bush and god is talking to moses and giving him his call and he says i am the god of abraham of jacob and isaac and yeah it's just like i am like that verb present tense am is very important very key yeah like these guys are supposedly dead but they're not dead they're living they're alive because the resurrection is real you know so man jesus's responses to all of these showdowns is always incredible to me and then there was a guy in the crowd who asked him about what the most important commandment was and this was a challenge i think more from an older wiser teacher who kind of was like jesus is saying some really profound things let me like let me ask him to see if he knows the truth about you know which it's interesting because this question was not a trap it was a real question but it was almost like pop quiz jesus what's the most important commandment yeah let me test you and see if are you really still on the same page with these laws that we have yeah do you know the truth of them and jesus responds correctly you know uh love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength and and the the man who asked responds and says yes and i understand that to love god and to love others is greater than any sacrifice of any animal that i could ever make yeah and jesus said to him you're not far from the kingdom it's just really interesting because jesus wasn't there like having these showdowns he wasn't like uh you know how when you don't like somebody and you try to get a rise out of them it's like the pharisees were trying to get a rise out of jesus they were trying to make him an enemy and jesus wouldn't be an enemy right he responds to this man by acknowledging like you're not far you're close like you're almost there you know and so i just love the fact that jesus doesn't he's not willing to give in to the pressures of like i'm sure like in the flesh there probably was a temptation to just be like you know what i'm done with you people like right you guys are all you know and to just like kind of like um angrily speak against all of them and not be open to dialogue and not be open to the idea that anybody could be any any pharisee could be good but here he is he's still open he's still dialoging you know yeah he doesn't shut down which i think like really takes a lot of strength um and then there's this one last kind of showdown that i wanted to highlight which i know has a scripture reference from the old testament but jesus is like you know what you guys want to challenge me all day long i've got a question for you so he asks them who is the messiah yeah and where does he come from and he quotes this passage from the old testament do you want to talk to us a little bit about what he was saying at that time yeah yes very direct again um so he's he's quoting from psalm 110 verse 1 which says the lord says to my lord sit in my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet and then he goes on to say since david called the messiah my lord how can the messiah be his son and and so it's kind of just like a like hello guys like have you read your scriptures like david is calling him my lord so obviously like he's lord and like that's me like he's talking about me and i think about um hebrews 1 when i when i read that because hebrews 1 also quotes it and basically the first couple chapters of hebrews are talking about how jesus is greater than the angels greater than moses he's our high priest and he is the exact rep representation of god yes and so jesus is really like shared out saying like i'm the messiah i'm the chosen one i am like higher and mightier than all of these yeah yeah again like it's for those who are listening it's made clear like holy week especially really highlights you really have all these passages where jesus is highlighting to his audience who he is yeah um but yeah jesus's question that he poses to the pharisees here was so poignant that this scripture says that they wouldn't dare to ask him any more questions because they were just like we we don't know like we can't like i gave up again like i always like this you know they did some like scriptural karate and jesus just like outmatched them every time and so finally they gave up um but matthew records what he shares after this where he just he just really rebukes the religious leaders of that day and he talks about a ton of things you can read the whole chapter matthew chapter 23 if you wanted to but he talks about the things that they were doing that were wrong so it's not just an angry response it's he's he's actually teaching as he's rebuking them because he's saying look like i am god we gave you this covenant right we gave you this law so that you could relate to us and you've turned it into something it wasn't meant to be and this is how you've done that so it's giving example after example after example of how the pharisees and religious leaders of that day had turned the law into something that it wasn't meant to be it wasn't meant to be so that there could be this elitist teachers being better than everyone else no they were supposed to be servants it wasn't so that they could split hairs over what is what is what is a sin and what isn't a sin and how much can i get away with without you know how what can i swear by without offending god or um and it wasn't this thing where people were supposed to spend all their time again splitting hairs over these tiny little sins and missing the big ones like faith and mercy and justice and love and it wasn't about being you know looking good on the outside it was about being clean on the inside truly and honestly before god and um so he just really calls them out and he says listen prophets and teachers and godly men have come and spoken to the people of israel throughout human history and the religious leaders have murdered them all and the pharisees are kind of like what are you talking about and jesus is like yeah i'm pointing that out because they're about to do the exact same thing to him and he's the ultimate like if there ever was a prophet that you think would get through to anyone it'd be god like literally god you know in human flesh coming and speaking in uh it's so ironic and yet so sad tragic heart-wrenchingly sad at the same time absolutely so then he says to them that he's going to continue to send teachers and godly people he's talking about his disciples but they the pharisees will not see him again until they say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord yeah right and quoting that thing that that people were um praising him with at his triumphal entry when the pharisees were like yeah we won't do this we are against you and he's like no not until your hearts come back around and you're able to join in with what heaven is saying what the truth is about who i am and praise me you know you're not going to see me again and i think that's a reference to um kind of this space in time where jesus is not walking the earth yeah and so we're he's looking for people to turn to him yeah so jesus taught in the temple for a lot of time on tuesday tumultuous tuesday it was stressful day of lots of um showdowns and then he's leaving the temple towards the end of the day and his disciples are still following him and along the way there's a couple more jesus nuggets as i call them he talks about this widow who gave an offering of just a couple coins at the temple and he's like you know what god sees that god sees that and he knows that what she gave is more than what anyone else gave because she gave everything she has again like just this little moment where jesus is kind of like fitting in as much teaching and as much like goodness as he can in these last moments with his disciples or just kind of like this is how god is this is how it's supposed to be you know and and when i'm not with you don't be tempted to think that the rich people who are able to give these huge offerings are the greatest that's not how god measures things he doesn't measure things in human terms they talk to him about how beautiful jerusalem is and he laments over the fact that he knows that jerusalem is going to be destroyed and just in just a few decades after his death and resurrection jerusalem was completely destroyed under the roman empire and so the temple was was destroyed the buildings were destroyed and he's prophesying about all of these things and so he gets into this prophetic mode he gets up you know passes that valley we talked about up onto that hill the sloping hill with all the olive trees and the mount of olives it's called and he stops there to give another sermon i guess you could call it the fancy title for it is it's the olivet discourse nice yeah and this is one of those passages where we get a lot of prophecies about the end times um so jesus here i mean like this is his last week kind of before his death we know that he was still around for 40 days after he resurrected right but his time is drawing to a close on earth and he's telling his disciples the things that they need to know and so he begins talking to them about the things that are to come and there's kind of two big categories of what he talks about he talks about prophecies about the the jews and jerusalem and the disciples and the persecution that they're going to experience and martyrdom and you know how jerusalem itself is going to fall how the jews are going to be dispersed how how you know the believers that people believe in jesus are going to be dispersed and he's just encouraging them to stay firm and stand faithful in the midst of even how how horrible it's gonna get and we know from history if you've read your history books you know like that is exactly what happened everything that he spoke about in luke 21 19 he told them by standing firm you will win your souls so he's just trying to give them those little nuggets that they need nuggets of truth to stand and to to withstand all that's going to happen but there's also a huge grouping of prophecies that he gives that haven't happened yet where he's talking about how we're going to know when he will return to finally establish his kingdom because right jesus just did the triumphal entry he arrived as the you know coming king yeah and so and it was nothing like what the the people had hoped it would be it becomes clear okay this guy's not setting up an earthly kingdom he's actually not you know ins you know um provoking invoking whatever the word might be provoking revolution he's not um you know bearing arms or getting swords or trying to tell lead us to victory against the romans so what is he doing and they're trying to listen to him the disciples are like well when are you going to do this kingdom thing that you've been talking about and he's like it's gonna come i'm going to return and this is how you'll know that i'm coming and he talks about all of these signs of the end times he talks about how the world is going to continue in a path of um all of these events that might happen famines and plagues and things like that talks about how he will return and how the world will be judged there's a lot there and if you're really interested in hearing about those signs i'd encourage you to read matthew chapter 23 but the two things that i wanted to highlight are the directives that he gives in every gospel there's something that jesus says about being ready by being faithful he keeps telling his disciples be ready by being faithful and i just want to read a couple of verses to you about being ready by being faithful as we close our podcast today so pardon the rustle of my bible pages here matthew 24 45 says this is jesus speaking a faithful sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them and that's what he's telling his disciples to do there that's what he's telling us to do to be a faithful sensible servant one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them it's a really powerful and heavy responsibility there and mark chapter 13 mark captures a couple of the things that jesus said uniquely mark chapter 13 verses 35 to 37 jesus said you too must keep watch if you don't know when the master of the household will return in the evening at midnight before dawn or at daybreak don't let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning i say to you what i say to everyone watch for him that is what we're supposed to be doing we're not supposed to be saying ah who cares when jesus comes back that doesn't matter we're supposed to be saying no jesus is coming back so we have to live in a way that demonstrates that we're faithful to him he's the coming king and we are overseeing his kingdom now and we're doing the things that we know he wants us to do um and then luke chapter 21 verse 34 to 36 jesus also said watch out don't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness and by the worries of this life don't let that day catch you unaware like a trap for that day will come upon everyone living on the earth keep alert at all times and pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the son of man so it's no joke what jesus is talking about as he's preparing us for the rest of human history that we're going to be experiencing while he's sitting on his throne in heaven and while we're waiting for jesus our king to return but that is exactly what i would love to leave you with we are living in tumultuous times sometimes some days are more than others tumultuous tuesday was a crazy day for jesus but it's a great example for us to see how he responded and to try to follow in his footsteps and to make sure that we're remaining faithful to jesus our king christina would you lead us in prayer as we close yeah all right dear jesus i want to thank you again so much for this time that we have to look at your word to follow your footsteps through this amazing week god i pray that you would draw us into that faithfulness that perseverance in in you god and that steadfast fastness and being good stewards of what you've given us god i just pray that we would continue to put our hands to um spreading the good news of who you are and to um spreading justice and and spreading mercy god and i pray that we would that you would find us faithful on the day that you return god that you would find us uh ready and and waiting and happy to see you yeah um and got it i pray that we would be like that that man who asked you uh what the greatest commandment is that we would be um just wanting to learn just realizing that wisdom is with you god and the words that you speak are good and full of wisdom god and that we would just seek after that lord i pray that we would keep our hearts pure god and i pray that we would continue to analyze and assess the state of our hearts god and continue to clean out what is not of you god and continue to fill up with what you have given us god um and i pray that we would uh be like that widow god and and that we would be full of forgiveness god and that we would have the faith to to move mountains god and we would all do it for your glory and your name and and uh to worship you god and and to live in right standing with you jesus i pray that you would purify our hearts and our minds god we thank you so much for your word and who you are god and who we are in you jesus and i pray that you would continue to uh breathe life into us throughout holy week god i pray that you would bless each person who's listening as they go about their day and i thank you so much for this time in your name i pray amen amen amen thank you so much guys for joining us [Music] that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is you", "welcome back to our prayer podcast this is pastor dave and this is episode three today we're going to be talking about promises the promises of god and i have a question for you what is the promise you have been waiting on what is the promise you are waiting on right now what are you praying for what are you asking god for can you name it specifically in hebrews 11 6 it says that it is impossible to please god without faith anyone who wants to come to him must believe that god exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him when we think about the promise that god made to abraham if you read genesis chapter 12. abraham was 75 years old and god gives him this promise that essentially his whole life is about to change that he's going to go from being a person who is 75 years old and has no kids and his wife is unable to have kids to being a father of many nations that he's going to be a blessing to the whole world and the sign of this is that he's going to be having a son god is going to give him a son and it all kind of is in the balance based off of this one promise god gives abraham this promise and abraham then has to step out in faith and leave the current place where he's at because he can't stay where he's at he's got to move and he has to make the decision do i trust god is god pulling my leg here is is something fishy going on no i believe god and i'm going to step out in faith and i'm i trust god so much that i'm willing to relocate my entire family to this uh uh by the way that was an occupied territory at the time there was another nation there uh but abraham goes uh to canaan in faith he moves out and he takes all of his belongings with him because he trusts the promises of god and this is an important thing for us to realize that faith requires us to believe that god is real and that he rewards those who seek him have you ever talked to someone and asked them how can i pray for you and they say well i'm actually okay god has already given me everything that i need that might sound like somebody who's full of faith but the truth is that is a very faithless thing to say because according to god there is a reward still pending there are blessings there are promises of god that we haven't seen and so we must move forward in expectation and we must step out in faith what is the promise you are waiting on right now for abraham after god appears to him that initial time it's a 25 year wait approximately and in that time god is preparing abraham for the promise you see it's one thing for god to give the promise it's another thing for us to be formed in order to be ready for the promise if abraham would have received the promise right away where he was in that land that godless land where he lived he might have never left and the destiny of the world would have been shaped differently he had to leave he had to move out and the whole time god is not just testing him but preparing him because during that time period that abraham is waiting he is becoming a warrior he is becoming a provider he's learning how to survive in this hostile environment and that's what he's going to need to become a father of nations to learn from his mistakes so that when isaac comes to the forefront and he he is born his son abraham is a different person because he has learned to trust god through the trials through the failures and that's what he's calling us to do today god has promised you something but he's he's not just having you wait with your arms crossed he is preparing you to receive the fullness of what you were born for because god he already had a purpose for you when you were in your mother's womb and he's going to bring that to pass but hebrews 11 6 says that it is impossible to please god without faith anyone who wants to come to him must believe that god exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him there's a reward you're not being greedy by thinking of the reward according to this you have to you have to believe that god has more for you that's not a selfish thing that's just believing that god is extremely generous and he can give you your promise and he can also equip you to receive your promise and that's where we're all on this journey of being prepared for the promises of god why don't we pray today as we close jesus we thank you for being faithful we thank you for your promise [Music] we thank you for the many things that you desire for our lives help us god to make room for you and to sincerely seek you with everything we've got we're gonna push forward god we believe that you're real that you reward us and we believe that even if it seems like you're taking forever you're building us up you're forming our character the character of a warrior is being birthed within us through every circumstance when we hold on to your promises and it's in jesus name we pray amen it's been a pleasure being with you here today and we'll see you again tomorrow bye", "\n\n**Untitled**\n\n  \n\n50% of PC data accurate by May 13th\n\n  \n\nAccurate:\n\n  \n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nCell\n\nAddress\n\nFacebook ETC.\n\n  \n\n  * We don't

volunteer so please sign up for that so uh jessica our kids ministry director can uh reach out to you for that many years ago kelly and adam and i kelly and adam are worship leaders and i went to los angeles for a training and one night was off and we went out and we went down to uh hollywood to the walk of fame and you know that's where all the stars are at on on the sidewalk and there was this giant crowd of people waiting when courtney cox of friends fame you know courtney so she she steps out of the car and everybody goes crazy i mean just just screaming and yelling they're so excited to see friends was kind of at this peak and they were gathered around they were just every time a new star would come out they would get so excited you ever thought to yourself i wish i loved somebody enough to go that crazy for them like you would just drop everything to be with them you would barely contain yourself when you were in their presence you just had passionate loyalty to someone that you knew the words that they spoke could not possibly be untrue and that's that's pretty significant but i want you to catch this that's exactly how people felt about jesus as he was coming in to the city on palm sunday which we celebrate today tens of thousands of people had gathered in jerusalem for the largest and holiest of all annual celebrations and in the scriptures in john chapter 12 it says this the next day the news that jesus was on his way to jerusalem swept through the city a huge crowd of passover visitors that's the festival took palm branches and went down the road to meet him they shouted praise god bless the one who comes in the name of the lord hail to the king of israel jesus found a young donkey and sat on it fulfilling the prophecy that said don't be afraid people of israel look your king is coming sitting on a donkey's cult his disciples didn't realize at the time that this was a fulfillment of prophecy but after jesus entered into his glory they remembered that those scriptures had come true before their eyes those in the crowd who had seen jesus call lazarus back to life were telling others about it you need to understand something i'll pause when it says earlier the next day this is right after jesus said lazarus had been dead for four days and jesus calls him out of the tomb and he's alive again this got some uh this went viral all right this is the ancient version of going viral on social media okay everybody knows about it they're telling everybody about it like you got to be kidding lazarus used to be dead i saw him dead a couple of days ago and now he's alive he's here in the crowd you can just see this moment everybody's telling each other about lazarus is alive and this is the guy that made him alive after he was dead so this is the main reason that so many people went out to meet him because they had heard about this mighty miracle i also want you to get this this crowd was not just filled with people that was curious about lazarus or had been friends of lazarus this is also a crowd of people that contained people that used to be blind but now they could see and they're like yeah yeah yeah i know that jesus rose him from the dead but i used to be blind and i can see you now and so i can just imagine in this crowd people are topping their stories no no but you don't understand i used to have leprosy and now my my fingers and toes are all here now my skin is good i used to be dead too look at me now i'm alive you know that that's that's what's going on i can just imagine the scene of people one-upping themselves look at my hand it didn't used to work and now it works this would have been a very interesting moment they're looking at each other uh sorry then the pharisees said to each other we've lost look the whole world has gone after him so those were the spiritual religious leaders of the moment they were jealous of jesus why did the people love jesus so much well very simply he loved ordinary people regular people jesus loved regular people one day jesus was preaching on the shore of the sea of galilee and great crowds pressed in on him to listen to the word of god he noticed two empty boats on the water's edge for the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets stepping into one of the boats jesus stepped onto the boat jesus asked simon its owner to push it out into the water so he sat in a boat and taught the crowds from there when he finished speaking he said to simon now go out where it's deeper let down your nets and you will catch many fish master simon replied we worked hard all i all last night and didn't catch a thing but if you say so we'll try again and this time their nets were so full they began to tear a shout for help from their brought their partners from the other boat soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking when simon peter realized what had just happened he fell to his knees before jesus and said o lord please leave me i'm too much of a sinner to be around you those are really fascinating words please leave me i'm too much of a sinner to be around you for he was awestruck by the size of their catch as were the others with him his partners james and john sons of zebedee were also amazed jesus replied to simon peter don't be afraid from now on you'll be fishing for people and as soon as they landed they left everything and followed jesus those three words they left everything really important and follow jesus this became the core team for jesus his disciples his followers when you hear about the 12 disciples this is this are part of the guys there and these are the guys the disciples simon peter fisherman andrew fisherman james fisherman john a fisherman matthew or levi as the scripture calls him he's a tax collector he's one of the bad guys phillip and bartholomew and thomas and james and thaddeus and simon the zealot he was a revolutionary militia guy judas iscariot who betrayed him they're just 12 regular guys by regular comes with all of the challenges of being regular but there were other disciples of jesus as well that sometimes get overlooked because of the 12 and the easy 12 guys to list off luke chapter 8 tells us about three other disciples that aren't talked about a lot soon afterward jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages preaching and announcing the good news about the kingdom of god he took 12 disciples with him along with some women it's just another way to say disciples who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases among them were mary magdalene from who he had cast out seven demons don't mess with her joanna the wife of chuza herod's business manager so herod was the regional leader and so chuza was like one of his guys and this was his wife so this is interesting and then susanna and many others who were contributing from their own resources to support jesus and his disciples mary magdalene joanna and susannah were also disciples of jesus they all were traveling together if jesus were picking out his disciples today where would he go i think he would go outside dunks find a few guys and gals i think he would go down to the shore and go to the boats and find some lobstermen maybe he'd go out find some gang guys and some mobs and a couple of extortioners some hard-working guys maybe not with the cleanest of records maybe they didn't have such honorable pasts jesus had a way of speaking with the upper class the wealthy he knew them they knew him but he did not choose to reside with them rather he and his followers went out of their way to be with the regular people that he loved the love of jesus was and still today is stronger than any classism any racism any prejudice or any bigotry the love of jesus was then and still is today stronger than the upper class the middle class the low class or the no class the love of jesus is stronger than all of that you see he sees through the pretense and the falsehoods his words have a way of piercing the heart his touch has a way of binding up the broken and his love makes all things possible because jesus is stronger jesus went out of his way to be with the samaritans who were the outcasts of the day he went out of his way to be with the children because they were the weak and the need of protection he went out of his way to be with tax collectors these are really bad guys the most detested betrayers and criminals of the time intentionally went to be with them the adulterers and the sexually broken he defended and challenged at the exact same time a unique balance the blind he was not afraid of them rather he embraced them and healed them the lame he healed them of their sin and their suffering the dead think about that jesus hanging out with dead people he raised physically dead people back to life and he breathed new life into the spiritually dead the religious he challenged their faulty religious systems of the day then he showed in his words and actions that he was in fact the real deal jesus placed himself with real people in real life situations he told stories instead of fancy theological treaties he walked everywhere he knew people he wanted to be with the people we don't have records of jesus riding into town on horses and chariots or camels seems like he just wandered around walking with people wherever people were he wanted to be with the people and it's really important because he is emanuel god with us god amongst us he was and is and always will be the greatest example for us to imitate in our everyday life if you don't know what to do just do what jesus would do imitate jesus jesus was amongst us on purpose with regular people i was talking with a man shortly after we started east coast international church that was telling me about how he felt called by god to help the poor and he specifically wanted to help interstate kids from lynn by providing athletic programs and mentoring i got very excited about this i thought it was a great idea and within a minute i had already dreamed up a 17-point strategy on how to execute this and how we could accomplish this this goal but when i started talking to him about the facilities in lynn that we could rent and the parks that we could use he started backtracking really fast we got all embarrassed and he said i actually i thought you could bring the kids to me an hour and a half away i said oh you want to reach the city without actually getting your hands dirty and coming to the city i said no thanks we already have enough of those kinds of people the ministry of jesus was incarnational meaning amongst with being in the city with the people in the homes in the cafes on the streets with the officials with the children with the families and that makes a huge difference it still makes a huge difference for us today that's why we focus on cities focus on people in those cities jesus made it a point to not be perceived as untouchable he went out of his way to build bridges into people's lives so that he could love them because jesus love is strong enough for everybody see jesus loves the rich and he loves the poor he loves the holy and the unholy jesus loves the healthy and the sick he loves those that are lifted up and those that are humble he loves the faithful and the unfaithful he loves you and he loves me it's true because jesus is stronger he's strong enough for everybody as jesus rides over the top of the mount of olives and he comes down palm sunday road on the way into the city they loved him they loved jesus because he first loved them and let this hit your heart today maybe you have never met jesus not really and i want you to know that jesus he already loves you even if you don't know who he is they love jesus they love jesus another reason was because he spoke out and acted for justice luke chapter 19 it says then jesus entered the temple he's going up the steps to the temple and he began to drive out the merchants from their stalls he told them the scriptures declare my temple will be a place of prayer but you have turned it into a den of thieves after that he taught daily in the temple but the leading priests and the teachers of the religious law and the other leaders of the people began planning how to kill him but they could think of nothing because all the people hung on every word that he said it sounds like jesus was a little angry here why was he so upset because the supposed people of god had turned their faith into a mockery they had turned this vibrant and powerful relationship with god into a religion and jesus was indignant about the whole thing this was to be a place of hope and justice and they had somehow managed to turn it into a place of guilt and despair and thievery no wonder he was upset some leaders felt threatened by this by how much people loved jesus and so they began to oppose jesus isn't it interesting how even today in 2022 right and goodness are still not always popular and when you stand for justice you still will be opposed and you will be attacked certain leaders became jealous at the time they tried to capture jesus and eventually they did capture jesus and kill him wait what well they killed jesus yep if you're new to that if you're new to all of this you didn't know that killed jesus come back next sunday we'll take care of that the truth is oftentimes so painful that others will become fearful and lash out at the messenger bringing the message sometimes you get defamed but remember this god is with you and you are in good company it's all right because some religious leaders were called out for their sin they began to slander jesus to other people many times people will say things in order to try to harm you with their words for example the term christian was originally used as an insult to describe the people that follow jesus yet we own that word today if you stand for justice get ready for the battle of a lifetime in whatever area it might be those that stand for biblical justice ultimately become our heroes and the truth is in a world so broken and fallen and complicated and chaotic today we need more heroes that's you be a hero we need more mother teresas and martin luther king juniors we need more heroes our culture has so few heroes that that we replace them with non-significant like propped up heroes entertainers and athletes we don't need any more movie stars and rock stars and sports stars we have enough they may be very talented and gifted by god but they are not our heroes our heroes serve others and save others a hero serves a higher purpose it's often bigger than the purpose that they stand for it's oftentimes is really about integrity and character and justice and humanity a sense of call drives them to do something significant with their lives those who read the scriptures and don't come away with god's deep concern with the for the poor are simply not reading the same scriptures and if after the reading of scripture you don't feel compelled by compa by the compassion of the holy spirit the spirit of god to change the world by making a difference in the life of somebody else then your heart may be hardened and you need to check it see jesus spoke out and acted for justice and he wants you and i to do the same people didn't love jesus because he was the most religious they loved him because he loved them and that he lived his life to destroy the works of satan and to set captives free and they knew it was true the love of jesus was stronger than the injustice of the political systems and the rejection of the religious system jesus was stronger then and he's still stronger today another reason that the people loved jesus was that he's stronger than your past you see jesus met people where they were not where they were supposed to be imagine if jesus could only meet you where you're supposed to be he would always be up there somewhere over there in the far distance but that's not what jesus did he met them where they were at and he meets us today where we are at not where we're supposed to be one night jesus was invited to a dinner a dinner event at the home of a prominent man in the community and in luke chapter 7 it tells us that a certain immoral woman from the city heard that he was eating there and she brought a beautiful alabaster jar with expensive perfume then she knelt beside him at his feet weeping this had to be an awkward moment her tears fell on his feet and she wiped them off with her hair then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them culturally we don't have a close connection to this but what it was it was an act of adoration it was an act of gratitude it was an act of the complete abandonment of one's previous life and the embracing of a brand new life a jesus life is what's happening here clearly this woman who many think is mary magdalene clearly she was responding to something jesus had already done his forgiveness his deliverance his healing something verse 39 when the pharisee who had invited him saw saw this he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman is touching him she's a sinner not the most generous man all the host all the hosts can see is this woman's past but all jesus can see is her future for many of you today you walked in here you may have walked you may have been living with this for weeks or months or years and the devil is just constantly reminding you of your past i want to remind you today that jesus has you here to prep you for your future he accepts you right where you're at not where you're supposed to be verse 47 jesus responds to this man's thought it's always crazy when jesus responds to your thought i tell you her sins and they are many acknowledges the truth have been forgiven also the truth she has shown me so much much love then jesus said to the woman your sins are forgiven verse 50 your faith has saved you go in peace catch this today jesus did not ignore her past but he was stronger than her past and he is stronger than our past today he's stronger than your past the greatest sermon in history was not in a church even though last sunday was very good i laughed i laugh at my own joke sorry about that the um the greatest sermon in history was preached outdoors it was outside matthew chapter 5 and it said that one day crowds were gathering jesus went up on the mountainside with his disciples and sat down to teach them why did go outside because nobody would have come if it was in the church no one would have cared if jesus didn't live in public what he was talking about jesus also never required people to change something before they came to him simply come as you are but he always expected them to become more than what they were even if what jesus said was difficult to hear you still knew it was the right thing and you still knew he said it out of great love and compassion jesus had a crew of followers that were disreputable actually disreputable sinners the bible says there were those that had no pedigree no college degree those that had lived previously in demonically tormented lives those that had lived on the edges of society that were outcasts many who had no resources or means to make a significant living they were poor and destitute many the crowds were filled with all kinds of people every kind of person jesus also in his teachings would really send some zingers to the religious people of the day and to strip away their false piety that's what's going on here a lot of people think that when jesus would speak to the pharisees and the sadducees the religious leaders that he was condemning them but that's not the heart of it the heart of it is not for jesus to be mean to them but he's trying to get their attention and call them back to the heart of the father so all this other religious nonsense you're missing the point they had walked so far away from the love of god that they had replaced a relationship with him with a religion and one of the guys that heard this was a guy named nicodemus and according to scripture nicodemus came to jesus late at night probably so none of his religious buddies could see and he asked jesus for some more teaching and even though nicodemus had previously been part of the problem as a religious hypocrite jesus was stronger than his past as well and he called him forward jesus was never interested in starting a religion never as the worship team comes up but he was and is still interested in starting a relationship with each and every one of us today because jesus is stronger than religion you see religion is a private thing a relationship is a public thing religion fills one with shame but relationship with jesus makes one proud religion is manufactured by men and relationship is god breathed religion is something that people kill for but a relationship is something you only die for jesus wants a relationship with you not a religion with you and it's important for us to know that jesus will meet you where you are at today and he will take you to where you need to be because jesus is stronger than your past would you stand with me as we close today isn't that great jesus is stronger than our past great [Applause] with your eyes closed and your head spout today [Music] is there something in your life today that you need jesus to be stronger then [Music] maybe you're not where you're supposed to be jesus will meet you there today right where you're at [Music] no matter what baggage you brought in today no matter how many lies the enemy speaking into your mind [Music] jesus is stronger [Music] jesus was stronger then he's stronger now and he'll be stronger for the rest of eternity [Music] so today i want to encourage you if there's something that you need to give to god you bring it to him because jesus is stronger as the worship team leads us in this song let's just bring those things to jesus today bring those things to jesus right now the altars are open let's spend some time letting jesus be stronger today you", "[Music] [Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting today we have the privilege of praying for our world outreach partners now why is this such an essential thing to do well let's jump into our scripture and we'll go from there john 3 16 says for this is how god loved the world he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life here we find the ultimate human right the idea that every human being deserves an opportunity to hear the message of jesus to hear that god loves them and that he sent jesus to rescue them now in order to accomplish this we as the church the capital c church send out missionaries which we also call world outreach partners to different parts of the world places that are in many cases extremely hostile to the message of jesus they're isolated and difficult to get too difficult to get access and these missionaries make some pretty extraordinary sacrifices they leave behind everything that they know they leave behind you know friends they leave behind their culture their language the things that they are familiar with and enjoy and they go to a place where everything is different and they have to essentially start over just so a few people can hear the message of jesus our prayer is that that would bear fruit but this is what goes on every single day people are stepping out and going to these places and what we want to do is we want to pray for them we want to pray that more people would have access to this message because think about it if this message has impacted your life if it's impacted my life then we want more people to hear and these missionaries are supported by you and i through our generous giving they're supported by the churches here in the united states and around the world but there is a lot of work to be done we have only scratched the surface and there are many people who still have not heard that there is a god that loves them and wants to have a relationship with them so i think we need to pray for all the missionaries of all the churches but specifically also our missionaries that we are sending out into these places that god would cover their families and you know make a way where there is no way so let's pray together heavenly father we give you thanks for sending jesus to die for us on the cross thank you that your love never fails and that you designed every human being in every part of the world to have a relationship with you however many still do not know they have not heard about the good news of jesus god we pray for the people we have sent out into the world into these nations people who are in many cases leaving a very comfortable scenario to go out in a very difficult terrain and they are isolated many times their families are falling into sickness they are being persecuted and in many cases they are giving up their lives just so that a few people a few more people a few more souls can hear the message of jesus god your love and the news of jesus is just that good and i pray that you would give the current missionaries that we support and that are being sent out boldness to preach your word give them creativity and ability to break through the strongholds of the enemy god we've been talking about breaking strongholds god and there are a lot of strong loads that need to be broken we pray that you would give these families health and restore their bodies god if there are missionaries right now that are suffering because of sickness or you know maybe you know post pandemic there has been a lot of consequences and now they are in even more of a complicated situation than they were before god would you show up would you encourage them would you motivate them to continue god and would you bring up laborers support systems all around them god to help them to help them in their families god we pray for you to bless them financially we pray that you would speak to them a fresh word a fresh revelation that they would be able to penetrate that those obstacles and got those spiritual walls that have been built up even in the most complicated situations we know that you're able to break through because you're the god of breakthroughs jesus i cannot even imagine what it would be like to not know about your love so we in a spirit of gratitude pray for these missionaries to succeed raise up more missionaries and god if you're speaking to us about going then help us to go and if you're calling us and speaking to us about sending then help us descend whatever part we have to play in accomplishing this great mission father empower us to go empower us to do it whatever it takes so that one more person and hopefully many many more will hear that you are a god of love god that you will save these people and god bless these missionaries efforts that the enemy would not steal the fruit of their labor that they would have more success more people getting to know you god when they do outreaches when they go out and share their faith and god many of these missionaries that are working under cover because they could literally die they are in a tight situation god but we pray that you would protect them and give them wisdom god set them free from all the traps of the enemy encourage them god help them and god we commit to continue to pray for our missionaries and thank you for sending them out we know that in due time you will give them their due reward for all their labor and for everything that they've left behind to follow you in jesus name we pray amen [Music] you", "all right sneaky how they did that that's good the uh so when we were uh look look I I'm so excited the yet for the second service today yeah I really am I I I missed you the I was whole first service I was like I can't wait to get to the second service yeah okay so this this week uh I think I mentioned last week this week uh my wife and I were down in Atlanta at the national black uh conference for our movement and it was just a great time in case you don't know our church is part of that uh uh fellowship and we are thrilled to be part of it we are um um I was not the they did I was checking they did not make me be the Usher but I was I was willing I certainly was willing the uh so we uh earlier we were singing a bunch of songs and I want and I want you to know that we uh sometimes I think that when we're singing you might think we're just being extra poetic or like singing poems but I want you to know that most of the time we're not it's we're being sometimes we are but most of the time we're being literal like today we think about saying about things like this Angels yes Thrones dominions Powers strongholds Freedom spiritual authorities victories the Holiness of God we talk about a lot of stuff like that that was literal yes right we weren't just waxing eloquent and poetic and uh that was literal amen we were waging spiritual war in the heavenlies that's what was taking place so if you're like oh well that's that's what's actually taking place there so so pay attention to that kind of stuff um last week we wrapped up a series called The Finger of God it was about the power and authority of God was and primarily it was about the Deliverance of the captives and really zoomed in on this idea that the Finger of God is that God sets those that are captive free and we're zooming even closer in on this idea that God sets those that are spiritually captive free and he delivers those that are bound up uh in satanic captivity and that this is done through Jesus because Jesus is the Finger of God he has all the power and authority okay if you want to know who God is you need to understand who Jesus is because Jesus is God that's the idea behind all of this and so so we wrapped up that series and so it's time for us to begin to put that into practice okay so we're set it's kind of we're we're setting us up here is the idea so we're starting a new series today called tearing down strongholds somebody say strongholds so so we're tearing down strongholds so in the book of Acts chapter 8 there's this guy named Philip who was an early church leader and this is as the early church is being being scattered and they're starting to spread the good news and message of Jesus across the world acts 8:4 those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah There When the Crowds heard Phillip they and saw the signs he performed they all paid close attention to what he said for with shrieks impure Spirits came out of many and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed amen so there was great joy in that City now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria he boasted that he was someone great and all the people both high and low gave him their attention and exclaimed this man is rightly called the great power of God they followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery now just to be clear the Bible is not suggesting that the sorcery was fake here in the text it's not making fun of him it's just accepting it as fact amen but when they believed Phillip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women Simon himself so the sorcerer Simon himself believed and was baptized and he follow followed Phillip everywhere astonished by the Great Signs and miracles he saw okay verse 5 back to verse 5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there the city in Samaria now Samaria that that should ring a bell for you Jesus had gone to Samaria several years before and had a powerful encounter with the Samaritan woman or the woman at the well and the people there at the time responded really well to Jesus but there was still a whole lot of work that needed to be done and this was a region the whole region of Samaria was a region where the people had much bitterness and anger and resentment and there honestly there was a lot of good reason for their anger there was a lot of Injustice against them it was a very complicated backstory okay but as a result of that bitterness and anger and resentment as is always the case it made them uniquely open to spiritual deception and so even today in 2024 if you find yourself bitter and angry and resentful it exposes you and creates an openness to spiritual deception okay any yeah these Samaritans had been amazed and seduced by this magic and sorcery for a long time and had become honestly addicted to Simon the Sorcerer And His deceptions however they were more amazed by the straightforward truth of the good news of Jesus and they believed on Jesus now Simon the Sorcerer of which had been controlling the city up until this moment but little did Simon know that there was a new thing about to happen that Deliverance was coming Simon thought he had it all under control he was even nicknamed the great power of God the Arrogant imagine that little did he know that a Revival had just broken out in somebody's basement up the street and it was just getting ready to break loose in the whole town see God had lit a fire in Philip's heart and he was coming to the city to set the city on the right side up and I think it's interesting you know in the text it doesn't tell us all the details of how the crowd started to form and all that kind of didn't tell us the time frame or anything but you know that Phillip here he is coming into town he meets somebody and things start to build you know that's how these things take place and God God has a way of starting with one he starts with Phillip and then somebody else and then and then somebody else and then somebody else and I want you to get this today you might feel like you're all alone and you might feel like you're the only believer in your family or in your school or you're the only moral or ethical human being at your job or in your neighborhood but one plus God is all that God ever needs and Moses think about this Moses delivered his people from slavery and Joseph fed the people after a SE through a seven-year famine and Nehemiah rebuilt the treasured City and Isaiah declares the Prophecies of God that are still being heard today because it only takes one plus God Amen I want you to get this today you are one and God is God and you put those two things together and it's going to be all right and the devil knows this if you ever get free if you ever get loose and everything else that's connected to you can get loose and free as well if you and I want you to know this that if you've ever felt opposition in your life like when you're trying to do the right thing when you're trying to go to the next place you're trying to make forward momentum in your life and it's like everything is breaking against you all hell is breaking loose against you that's because all hell is breaking loose against you it's not an accident you are correct indeed all hell is breaking loose against you because hell doesn't want you to move forward next levels next Devils that's how it works you're like I wish it wasn't that way stop whining it is that way if you've ever felt that opposition that means the en enemy is after you but the devil doesn't know who he's messing with because you are here right now and that means that the enemy's been trying to kill you your whole life and he hasn't you're here right now that tells me that you're have the potential to be a jailhouse breaker a Mountain Mover a giant killer that means that if you're following Jesus that you're anointed to slay the enemy Hallelujah again he's been trying to kill you your whole life life but you're still here tell your neighbor you're a jail house breaker tell your other neighbor you're a Mountain Mover tell yourself you're a giant killer you're still here now look I know that some of you walked in here today and that's not how you felt you're like I might be a bug killer but I'm not a giant killer maybe you walked in here feeling a little oppressed a little depressed a little Poss possessed or maybe you felt like that about your kids I got it I got it maybe you felt like there's been a curse on your life come close that curse is about to be broken hallu tell your neighbor that curse is about to be [Applause] broken the evidence of scripture tells us this that Satan controls and oversees what we'll call an army of demons these are Fallen Angels these demons these negative spiritual entities clearly attempt to disrupt people's lives and I want you to see that there's uh and we'll we'll frame it Loosely that these are principalities these these demonic authorities over regions even and without being too legalistic about this just come along Daniel chapter 10 there's this broader story about this Con spiritual conf conflict and an answer prayer needed and uh somebody's praying for 21 days Daniel is in verse 13 it says but for 21 days the spirit Prince that those two words Spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way that Spirit Prince is a fallen angel It's a demon then Michael one of the archangels came to help me and I left him there with the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia so they're battling it out while the other Angel comes to give an answer now just to make sure that you don't miss this what we're seeing here is a somewhat just casual passing reference to the organizational flowchart for how Satan deploys his demons and so you see that there's a demon or a spirit Prince that kind of oversees the region of Persia okay now this along with some other parts of scripture you get a theme where you you see certain negative principalities Fallen Angels trying to keep people away from Jesus that's their job so Satan deploys so people say this all the time I might even say it like that Satan's after me well he probably actually sent some of his crew to get you right but it's because Satan's not everywhere okay he doesn't have that ability okay that's good news for you by the way okay uh so so he he releases these fallen angels to come and their job is to keep as many people away from Jesus as possible by whatever means available by whatever that group of people are most prone to buying into whatever lie and so in some parts of the world certain things work better than others and certain people groups different things work with and certain parts of the country different if you've ever traveled anywhere in the world or in the United States you know this that different things work with different people and keeping different groups of people away from Jesus for example in the United States certain parts of the country if uh there's a demonic strategy it would be make people like extremely religious so religious that it actually keeps them away from Jesus how's that possible just go down South for real other places it's like uh excessive liberalism other places excessive conservatism other places it's like there's a whole strategy in place about a hyperfocus on wealth or a hyperfocus on Pleasure or a hyperfocus on entertainment Hollywood and or some of the old school things like like regions the classic the old school problems like like that always work over places overwhelmed by violence or or poverty or addiction right that's the old school stuff like when all the other stuff doesn't work just like this the Special Forces Unit comes in with violence poverty or addiction those things always seem to work and so there's like these these re these entities that come alongside and help people stay away from Jesus one of the good things about this is that uh they tend to overstep uh like in the addiction space they overstep and people call out to God I'm in trouble I can't do it right people tend to like I'm in trouble with a lot a lot of these things okay and so that's that's a good thing it's also the SP uh God calling people and drawing them to himself spiritually sensitive people can feel uh these Spiritual Authority things happening these uh Regional things and structures when they they go to different regions like like driving into Lynn for example when I drive into Lynn when I outside of Lynn and I drive into Lin my my not my but the the holy spirit will like rise up in me and if I'm just by myself or if nobody's talking in the car under my breath the spirit I'll just start speaking in tongues I'll just start praying in tongues because I can I can feel I can feel the oppression and I don't like that uh when I fly into Boston I can feel a weightiness when I fly into other parts of the country that are not under the same type of thing I can feel it lift in Mark chapter 5 when Jesus uh cast the demons out of the demoniac the demons asked Jesus not to kick them out of the region they don't want to leave the region that was their space I think I just think that's interesting Okay so again this seems to be a theme in the scripture without being too legalistic about it just pay attention to it there seems to be this theme that and it helps us to understand that there are principalities and Powers at work in places like our city okay okay so just so you have that there's also principalities and powers that work over houses meaning our legacies like today we refer to family legacies by a person's last name like the Langs or shaves or orbas or labad or Millers or Hernandez's or matinas or araris you know you get this idea in the Bible family clans were referred to by the house of House of David House of Saul House of abinadab and it it seems to work like this that certain Spirits tend to run with or alongside of certain houses so it's like here your house is just moving along Generation generation after generation after generation after generation and then there's like a spirit that kind of tracks with you Generation generation okay generation just kind of messing with your family generation after generation after generation after generation until somebody kicks that Spirit out until somebody breaks the curse of that Spirit yeah if you look at the heritage of your family your house you might find that you've been fighting or had to fight your grandmother's devil come on man and if you're like why am I fighting my grandmother's devil it's because of this sit situation we're talking about right now amen why am I fighting the exact same thing that my mom and my grandmother fought this is why if you look at some people's ancestry they have generations of poverty Y and generations of cancer and generations of mental health challenges your mother was divorced your grandmother was divorced and her mother was divorced and your father took off and his father took off and his father took off and your mama was in the occult and your grandmother was in the occult and you did drugs with your mom and she did drugs with her dad you get the picture come on help us these are not just coincidences these are curses help us yes curses that need to be broken under the power and blood of Jesus Christ now [Applause] this is why we spent several weeks on the Finger of God to set you up for this our government has entire systems and programs trying to fix this problem on their own but they can't fix this problem on their own because it's not just a regular problem it's not just a natural problem there are some systems that need to be corrected okay that is true but it's not just a natural problem it is also a spiritual problem there are powers at work there are negative principalities and powers and those powers can only be cast down and curs is broken through Jesus Christ and so if that demon Spirit has just been tracking with your family for Generations you got to make a decision I'm going to end it now yes yes I'm going to end it so it doesn't keep on tracking Hallelujah and I would suggest that if you think that demon spirit's already been tracking with your kids that you do some work to grab that sucker and cast it out of that situation as well yes yes I want you to talk about the house of King David for a second now King David is this very complicated broken hero in the Bible um he there's a lot of great things that took place and a lot of really really really horrible things that took place like so many horrible things that he couldn't serve in Ministry at this church right like really really bad bad stuff um well that's not true he could serve in Ministry at a church uh it be be very much behind the scenes um probably had to have a few people watching a lot of people watch him okay um a curse came into David's life um through an offense an offense Came Upon David's life there is much tradition that says that David was rejected and scorned by his father uh due to some really extremely extremely complicated family drama that they probably wouldn't even make a TV show about it was so complicated and messed up about but you know what happens when you have major broken complicated unresolved family drama and issues that live in your heart and mind those things turn into curses that get pass down generationally those things that come on you pass down generationally yes they start with you as a curse and they keep on getting worse so this is what happens with David David ends up just messing up in all the worst kinds of ways he ends up becoming a whoremonger and has a lust problem and ab an abuser and a murderer he his family was a complete mess and his son absum was a deceitful and treacherous man that tried to overthrow him and and his son amnon raped his daughter Tamar and his son Solomon that became king had so many strange women 700 wives and 300 concubines that he completely lost control of his kingdom he literally his sons L split his kingdom in two just like he just messed up the whole thing come on now because he didn't deal with something now I could pick on David it's pretty easy and I can pick on Solomon it's also pretty easy those was a they were a long time ago but what about your house what about your heritage what about our heritage what about our houses what's going on in your house the enemy you see I want you to pay attention to this you're whether you realize it or not you're you've exposed yourself to deep spiritual warfare amen just by being in his room today the enemy you see you walk in here the enemy gets desperate because the enemy knows that there's potential for curses to be broken in your life your son or your daughter may all of a sudden be coming up and dealing with stuff that you didn't deal with until you were older the enemy might be getting desperate because all of a sudden you're around some people in God's family yes he may be getting afraid that the holy spirit's going to run him out of town and so he's going to try to get you in some weak spots so you might be who am I preaching to today amen well I'm can tell you I'm preaching to myself amen and hopefully I'm preaching to a couple of you as well hallu okay nobody that was the worst clap ever uh just so you know I I believe this I honestly believe this I believe God sent me on a mission to the city of Lynn from a long way away I don't I don't think I'm a hero or anything like that I just think that I was sent to be part of the team right but I I was just hanging out in a cornfield one day minded my own [Music] business minding my own business next thing I know I'm eating pastelitos and plantains I'm dodging potholes like I have a Honda [Applause] Civic and I noticed that we got a couple of demons here in Lynn and they need to be run out of town and I think that some of you have noticed them as well and I think for those of you that have lived here your whole life you've been wrestling with them for your whole life so I think we should get rid of them and let's not stop until we see them running all the way out of [Music] town now the truth is I don't wish poorly on any other community I just don't want them here all right right verse 12 but when they believed Phillip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women Simon the Sorcerer himself believed and was baptized I'm going to pause there just for a second he was baptized meaning baptized in water so here he is everybody's f a lot of this group they're following Jesus and they're letting everybody know hey we're following Jesus we're going to go down to the water and they they baptized them in water we actually I think we have a water baptism coming up in August August 11th and uh and what that is the people that are in charge of the ocean as long as they um as long as it's not polluted we go down and we uh we we have a water it's awesome when we do this but but so Simon what he's doing here is he's drawing a Line in the Sand he's saying listen guys I'm not a sorcerer anymore and that's who I used to be but now I follow Jesus amen I don't follow those other spirits I don't follow those fallen angels I don't follow those other power sources my source of power is now Jesus Christ right that's what he's doing he's drawing a Line in the Sand and that water baptism moment is his public uh acknowledgment of that okay so he believed what he heard and then he did this public acknowledgement moment and so when we do these water baptism moments uh that's really what that is for you if you've never been baptized in water and you've made a decision to follow Jesus it's your chance to just publicly acknowledge hey Hallelujah I'm on team Jesus here okay here let's I'm going all in here and he followed philli everywhere astonished by the Great Signs and miracles he saw um this whole scenario by the way should uh ring a bell that's very true with the moment when Moses uh was performing these uh signs in front of the Egyptian magicians and eventually the Egyptian magicians say oh this is done by the Finger of God amen okay so Simon is having this moment where he's like uh this is different this is this is way different okay this is a whole this this is done by the King of Kings okay this is different and so this is him being humble so when Philip started to preach in Samaria with such power and deliverance he got a hold of the strong hold of sorcery and God tore it down amen and in this moment what's happening it's like a Supernatural Cannon is going off a spiritual explosion it's like a pistol being shot by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit just says enough is enough I'm going to break every curse and every stronghold in Samaria come on now just imagine yes just imagine the holy spirit said enough is enough in Lynn hallu enough is enough I don't know I I do not know I don't know what that would take would take some people committed to inviting the holy spirit in to Breaking Every curse tearing down every stronghold I believe this I believe that God wants to do that same type of exploding and tearing down the strongholds upon your life though your life today and I believe that God wants to break the curse in your life whatever it happens to be and I want to and I believe that God wants to break the curse off the generations of your life once and for all once and for all I want you to get it down deep in your spirit that it stops with you it ends with you no more nobody else after you there's no more demon tracking with your family there's nothing going on after your generation it's done with you and it's off you right now the curse can be broken the curse will be

yesterday uh this is his his uh baby that he gave birth to here uh the at the width with the with movement and I want to encourage you uh if you would like to help this with movement continue its efforts in creating uh these community-based Solutions through the local church into communities that the Bible would say is our long long forgotten and devastated and uh we're the church is supposed to do something about those communities the church is supposed to Incarnate to be within these communities much like we have done right here in the cities of Lynn and Revere and uh we would like to encourage you in the church Center app there is an opportunity for you to give it's called with uh in your church Center app if you'd like to give towards that that would be a tremendously generous of you and helpful for what the with movement is trying to do so please consider giving to that today yesterday for those of you that were here yesterday yesterday was a tremendous day here at East Coast International Church the Justice Conference was great and there's much that we learned much that we need to execute and Implement in the days ahead and weeks and months and years ahead but we're going to have the great opportunity right now to hear from Bishop Walter Harvey one more time but I want to make sure you understand who he is Bishop Harvey was a long time Pastor in the inner city of Milwaukee Wisconsin he is the president of the national black Fellowship in our movement and he is also now one of our top 24 Executives we call him a bishop but if we were catholic we would call him a cardinal just so you understand the the level of influence that he has in our movement so why don't you welcome Bishop Walter Harvey here today [Applause] thank you all right I got a new title today Cardinal thank you thank you it's so good to be here um God is here in this place uh the worship was tremendous and uh just continuing in that flow um God has already been at work in East Coast International Church he's already been at work in you I'm just coming to add and to build up and encourage what he's already done what he's done through Pastor Kurt and through Jen and through all the pastors who are here I'm not here because this church needs to hear from me or because this church lacks anything you already have it it's already happening the with movement is already going on right here and uh can we just give God praise for what he has done already as Pastor Kurt said I pastored an inner city Church in Milwaukee for uh 28 years seven years prior to that I was a youth pastor in inner city Milwaukee and started basketball camps I used to play a lot of basketball I don't anymore the body can't do it the Mind still can imagine it but the body doesn't execute it so well but growing up as a kid I played a lot of basketball and the kids on my block that was the thing so we'd wake up in the morning and we'd meet outside on the sidewalk we'd each have our basketballs we'd be dribbling and we'd walk up the street to the playground play until the sun went down in fact we would actually play to the street lights came on because that was the cue that you had to have your butt back on the front porch when the street lights came on and so one particular day as we met out on the sidewalk we found out that we had nine players we were one short of a five on five and as we walked up towards the basketball court we would always pass the house of a young man in our block named Charlie Thompson Charlie Thompson didn't play basketball Charlie Thompson loved to play football and every day Charlie looked so lonely he would be sitting on his front porch he would be fully dressed in his football uniform he had on the cut off football pants he had on the cleats Charlie Thompson had a football jersey that was cut off right here and they were showing his six-pack now Charlie Thompson was 15 years old and had a six pack y'all he was built like some linebacker on the Patriots and he would always toss his football in his hand just looking like I wish somebody would play football with me but we needed a man to play to finish the basketball game and so we said hey Charlie why don't you come and you know fill out the basketball team we can play five on five Charlie said I will if you make a deal with me I'll play basketball with you guys if you all play football with me afterwards sounded like a pretty even trade so we weren't thinking you know we were young and immature and our rationalization wasn't you know at a higher level so come on yeah that's that'll work out so we weren't thinking Much Charlie played on the other team in basketball he wasn't on my team I so wish he had been on my team because when Charlie played basketball he played it like he was playing football he tackled you he played basketball in his cleats he didn't change into tennis shoes he still had on his football gear and when he fouled you it was like how that hurt so we finished playing a couple of games of basketball we walked back down the block we were getting ready to pass Charlie's house and wave Goodbye Charlie said ah oh wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute we had a deal you guys have to play football with me now Charlie lived next door to a vacant lot a house that had been torn down it was all covered in grass and that's where Charlie liked to play football so we picked teams again five on five and again Charlie was on the other team I was like man maybe I should have stayed in bed today God's trying to tell me something Charlie's on the other team and I mean Charlie didn't need a team he was quarterback linebacker running back defensive end offense Charlie could do it all by himself and so I remember our team had the ball we were on offense and Charlie was lined up over the center getting ready to rush the quarterback and I got over to the side as a wide receiver the quarterback said hike Charlie threw the center out of the way ran towards the quarterback tackled him but before he tackled him he flipped me the ball I grabbed the ball and I started running for my life I'm running towards the end zone and back then I was pretty quick so I'm running towards the end zone on him and I see it getting closer and closer then all of a sudden I started hearing footsteps it was Charlie Thompson and when I woke up you're laughing at My Pain I'm telling you Charlie Thompson caught me I didn't see him coming and the next thing I know I'm laying on my back and I'm gasping for air because Charlie Thompson knocked the wind out of me I thought I was gonna die I mean I don't know if you've ever had the wind knocked out of you but physiologically when you're your diaphragm is paralyzed it's not able to expand or contract so the lungs can receive or expend oxygen and you feel like you're gonna die you're gasping for a breath for about a minute you're not gonna die it's going to be all right the pet the diaphragm is gonna it's gonna overcome its shock but for that moment you feel like you're going to die well I want to I want to use that story my pain to take you to a period in David's life where David lived in the city called ziklag and the name ziklag means winding and I believe that there's some significance of this city of this place that was really one of David's homes that if we can extrapolate from David's experience we can learn how to get our second wind back because the truth is sometimes life can knock the wind out of you I want to take you to the scripture in first Samuel chapter 30. before David became king he and his men reached ziklag on the third day now the amalekites had raided the jev and ziklag they had attacked ziklagged and burned it and that taken captive the women and everyone else in it both young and old they killed none of them but they carried them off as they went on their way when David and his men reached ziklag they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive so David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep David's two wives have been captured a hinawim of Jezreel and Abigail the Widow of nabal of Carmel David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters but David found strength in the Lord his God the the background of this is that David has been a fugitive for a year and a half he's been fleeing for his life running from King Saul who was trying to kill him and David had went from place to place to place trying to find a home you know home is a place you lay your head down right at the end of a rough day at the end of whether it's work or school or whatever you've been doing when you get home it's like ah home sweet home David was looking for a place like that and he finally found one in this place called ziklag but while David was away with his fighting men for three days fighting a battle and you can imagine they came back exhausted they came back wounded probably with cuts and bruises and thirsty and hungry and wanting the comfort of home when they get back home they find that their city has been burned to the ground and nobody is there to tell them what happened because the wives that they had the children and all of their possessions have been raided and taken away and they don't know where they are and these men who are already exhausted who've had the wind knocked out of them through War they get home again and they get another gut shot and the Bible says that the men were so distressed they wept until they could weep no more now whenever you get a man to cry you've hit a you've hit a tender spot because you know we're taught Hey Big Boys Don't Cry right never let them see you cry you know guys we kind of cry like this laughs right you know we take out the handkerchief like we're blowing our nose and uh you know you don't see the tear but these were grown fighting men these were Charlie Thompson kind of men but they were weeping until they had no more tears I mean they were they were like baby crying you know how babies cry and then they kind of they don't have any more cry in them they're kind of trying to get some more these are men crying like that and they were so distressed that they started talking about stoning David it reminds me of the experience within our country of people of color black and brown people especially who've experienced gut shot after gut shot they're take you back about 101 years to the City of Tulsa Oklahoma that was reported to that a black man attempted to rape a white woman named Sarah page now the blacks in the City of Tulsa were very prominent very Innovative and creative and and they had managed after the war to come back and build a town that became middle class and upper class and they had their own Banks they had their own barber shops they had their own movie theaters they had homes some of them had elevators in the homes I mean this was a beautiful part of town so much so that they nicknamed It Black Wall Street and when this with it this rumor came out about this man attempting to rape a white woman it was a false accusation that was really predicated on the fear of white capitalism being wiped out by the progression of these this this black part of town and so what happened is for a period of about 16 hours a thousand homes and properties were destroyed hundreds of people were killed thousands of people were displaced and this part of town was just burned to the ground and wiped out it's kind of like what David experienced a gut shot having the wind knocked out of you and that's what racism does racism is Prejudice plus power that when used as a weapon and a tool can just knock the wind out of folks I've been there I I've I I've not been uh profile for bird watching while black but I've been profiled for just simply walking while black what are you doing in this neighborhood or driving while black or shopping while black in my uh near my my hometown is a city called Kenosha Wisconsin and you probably remember the name Jacob Blake a couple of years ago when this young black man was shot in the back I believe seven times point blank by a police officer thank God that he lived I remember one of my class colleagues who's now a head coach in the National Basketball Association Glenn dock Rivers was interviewed at the time and Doc River said and he said this with tears again when a man cries to that degree of sincerity he said I don't know why this country doesn't love us but we keep loving it back gut shot after gut shot just sometimes it's exhausting to be black and brown and red and yellow in America but I believe that there is a Grace upon East Coast International Church to be a model to this city to be a model to this region to be a model to the world to be a model to the body of Christ of what it means to be a church on Earth that looks like the church in heaven to be a model of what one of my favorite Heroes he's passed away his name was Chris Rice and he was a Pioneer in the Christian Community Development Association in one of his books he said God will not use the church to heal the land of racism but he'll use racism to heal the church you all are walking this thing out you're modeling it you're demonstrating it let's let's continue to do it and press on so deeper back into the story of David he comes back home to ziklag and ziklag was a home for David but it wasn't his first home and I want to take you and and and talk about an application of three of the homes of David and I want to call these the tests of home because home is where we learn our most basic lessons right home is where we're taught to say thank you and please and excuse me and home is where we're taught our ABCs and home is where we're taught manners and we're taught to speak and we're taught to you know to be uh to be polite if we pass the tests of home we can succeed in life but David's first home was Bethlehem that's where he was born he was born into a shepherding community and David's father Jesse assigned David the responsibility to take care of the Sheep now that seems like a like a promotion but it was actually the one of the lowest jobs in the in the Family household uh and uh so it was not really that he was honoring David by that David was the youngest of eight boys it was kind of like well you just take that you know go ahead we'll take care of all the important stuff so David was not necessarily a favorite son he was a forgotten son there are some biblical Scholars that believe that David might have been the illegitimate son of his father Jesse and I can understand why they would say that is because when the prophet Samuel in first Samuel chapter 16 was sent to the house of Jesse to anoint the next king of Israel all the other seven sons were invited to the coronation as candidates his own father did not even consider that maybe this eighth son could also be a candidate he wasn't even invited he was he was left out in the pasture taking care of the sheep so much so that in in verse 11 the uh the prophet Samuel says to Jesse wait a minute are all of your sons here because God hasn't chosen any of these seven and then Samuel uh Jesse says oh you know what I forgot my bad my bad uh the youngest one is not here he's out there with the sheep and Samuel says well go and get him because we're not going to sit down until he comes so David comes in and and the Lord says to Samuel don't look at the outer appearance that's the way people do they judge you you know by your age your gender your your ethnicity but God looks at the heart and when David comes in the Lord says pour the oil on him that's the one the tests of home Bethlehem is the test of stewardship it's the test of how you handle natural things and for David even though he was forgotten by man he was not forgotten by God and I believe the application for you and me is that God has put some things in our hands he's given every one of us a shape has given us strengths and spiritual gifts yes he's given us heart and passions H he's given us abilities a he's given each of us personalities and he's given all of us different experiences nothing is wasted when God every one of us have weapons in our hand it's our shape and I wouldn't encourage you to be faithful with the Natural Things be faithful in the mundane things be faithful being a mom being a dad be faithful in the place where you are in life spiritually and naturally because God is using those Natural Things he's perfecting something greater in you if you just pass the test of stewardship and every one of us is in that place he wants you to know that you're not forgotten he's teaching you great skills while David was in the in this in the in the pasture taking care of the sheep he was protecting them from lions tigers and bears oh my God oh that's a movie I'm sorry he was but there were lions and bears trying to take the sheep for lunch and David would take his natural sling and he would hurl it at the bear and kill the bear and they grabbed the lion by its Mane and break its neck and he didn't lose any of his father's sheep that's stewardship it's taking care of that which belongs to somebody else and God says if you're faithful with the small things I'll make you ruler over the greater things David passed that test of stewardship my favorite scripture in life in the scripture that I hope is put on my headstone when God calls me home as Psalm 78 verse 70. it's a testimony of David's faithfulness he chose David his servant and took him from the Sheep pens from tending the Sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people from tending and stewarding sheep now God says you've been faithful with that I'm going to allow you to be a Shepherd over my people and David shepherded them with Integrity of heart with skillfulness of hands he let that David from the oil poured upon his head while it's still dripping on his head there is a knock on the door and it's it's some emissaries from the Palace of King Saul we've heard your son David is a wonderful worshiper not only does he take care of sheep but he's a steward of worship the king needs him and immediately David is ushered off into the palace now he leaves his home Bethlehem and he goes to Jerusalem and he's now working for the king as like my sister was hitting those licks on the guitar David was just strumming on that harp and it would it would alleviate the evil spirits that were attacking the king while David was was in the vicinity of the king you all know the story of Goliath coming out and defying the armies of Israel defying God and David hears and David Rises up and says wait a minute I've killed lions and I've killed bears and this giant he's not too big to fight he's too big to miss let me at him David takes five stones but he only needs one and he brings Goliath down and David doesn't have a sword so he takes Goliath's sword and chops off his head I mean this is a Braveheart kind of movie right this is a this is a man's man he chops off his head picks the head up and carries it and puts it in his own tent and King Saul sees this and King Saul hears about this and and King Saul says I need to have this young man close to me but King Saul's motive was not pure his motive was to keep David close to him because he was afraid of David I mean King Saul he did a veto Court alone move uh move right you keep your friends close and you keep your enemies even closer all right he wanted to keep an eye on David because he was jealous of David he was fearful of David he was a he was afraid that David was going to take his shine take his throne because the women they began singing A Hymn about King Saul they said Saul has killed his thousands but David has killed his ten thousands you got to watch out for the people that can't sing your song people that are afraid of people complimenting you when God blesses you be wary of those who can't celebrate what God's doing in your life and so Saul brought David close because he wanted to keep an eye on him and the jealousy rose up so much within King Saul that Oak time after time he would try to throw a spear and kill David but God says no David it's not time for you to die so David fled from Jerusalem he ran away from home and some of us have run away from home some of us are running away from God right now some that are watching online are running from God you're not at home you're not you're not back at home like that prodigal son came back but there's an opportunity for you to come home David fled to his second home which was a place called a dullum a dullum we read about it in the 22nd chapter of first Samuel that David departed from there and he escaped he left to the cave of a dullum and when his brothers and all of his father's house heard of it they went down there to him and everyone who was in distress and everyone who was in debt and everyone who was discontented they gathered to him and David became a captain over them and there are about 400 men with them Bethlehem is a test of stewardship how do you handle natural things but a dullum is the test of relationship how do you handle people these 400 men came to David and they came at the bottom of their life they were in debt they didn't have any money come on God if you're going to help me send me somebody with some some capacity with some means they had debt they were already in the hole they were in distress they were discontented but by the time David got through mentoring and apprenticing and discipling them they were David's Mighty Men they could throw a sling with the right hand or with the left they were killing lions in a pit on a snowy day they were killing Giants that David couldn't kill because David passed the test of relationship they started with nothing by the time David was finished with them they were like the disciples when they came to Jesus they were just plain ignorant ordinary men but by time we get to the book of Acts the world took note that these men have been with Jesus how are you doing with the test of relationship don't look at anybody but husbands how are you doing with the test of marriage wives how are you doing with the tests of submitting and honoring your husband children well it's getting quiet right now how are you doing with the tests of honoring and loving your parents how are you doing in the test of relationship the third test that God takes us through to get our second win is where we began the city of ziklag that place of winding and this is the test of how do you handle pain loss and discouragement how do you handle the death of a marriage we call that divorce how do you handle the loss of Financial Security how do you handle the loss of a job how do you handle the loss of a home a place of rest how do you handle discouragement when a door and opportunity is there in front of you and the door slams in your face what do you do you go to the pills do you go to the bottles do you go to the you know to the to the line of crack what do you do how do you handle loss do you overeat do you shop what come on we deal with it in different ways how are you dealing with the test of discouragement well David shows us what to do verse 6 of chapter 30 says David found strength in the Lord his God the King James says David encouraged himself in the Lord his God I think the first thing that we have to do is that we have to pause to Lament when when loss happens and the worship team can come back up when loss happens don't be in such a hurry it's okay to pause and lament David cried when when we experience pain don't deny it I've done tons of funerals in my 35 years of pastoral Ministry and and I I saw some people who were pretty unhealthy in the way they handled grief they denied grief they denied loss they smiled through the funeral and Mama's laying there in front of them they're just smiling like I'm fine I'm like really because I know when my mama died I cried as I preached our funeral pause to lament it's okay it's okay to go through denial and anger and blame and bargaining and finally get to a place of acceptance It's all right pause to lament but you can't stay there when when death happens when the death of relationship or or the physical death the loss of a loved one happens you can't crawl in the casket with them and in your life no you can't stop pursuing love because you lost love no get your praise on that's what David does he encouraged himself in the Lord is God he said Hallelujah anyhow never never let my problems get when they were talking about stoning David he encouraged himself he found a place of Praise like Paul and Silas in the Philippian jail at midnight they sang praises to God and there were others in the prison who heard them singing when they didn't have a reason to sing then David does something else he gets in the posture of Prayer he says tell the priest to bring me the ephod the ephod was a was a prayer cloth that priests used to get a prayer through from the people to God and when God wanted to give an answer to the priest there would be some kind of a sign and it would come and it would manifest on the ephod and then the priests would tell the people what God Said but David didn't say tell the priest to pray for me David said bring me to ephod I'm gonna pray for myself there are times that you're not going to be able to reach Pastor Tanisha or Pastor Emily or Pastor David or Pastor Jesse or Pastor Kurt you've got to get a prayer through for yourself find a posture of Prayer to get your second win back and as you pray the next thing that happens is God's going to give you a plan because if you ask him he'll tell you he'll give you a plan he gave David a plan when David was praying he said Lord shall I pursue I don't know what to do I don't know where the people are I don't know who did this I don't know where my family is but God began to give David a plan because as he gave as he prayed God said pursue you're going to recover all David just started walking out in faith he just started following the trail following the tracks I think they went this way and as they went that way they found a young Soldier a young servant of one of the soldiers who had been left behind three days he had been left behind because he was sick and they just left him for dead that's so that's whoever was responsible stewarding that servant they failed the test of sewership and the test of relationship because we don't throw people away when they get sick we don't throw people away when they fail when they fall when they're weak that's the time we pick them up and we carry them until they can walk on their own they found this young servant who had been without food or water for three days and who was sick and they nourished him back to health and they said we're going to let you live if you tell us who took our family and he gives them the plan the detail listen if you pursue if you don't quit the Bible says that you have to uh be not weary and doing well because you're gonna you're gonna reap in due season if you just don't quit don't quit I want to invite you to stand on your feet right now because I believe that in this space right now there are some of us that feel like giving up that you perhaps feel like life has knocked the wind out of you and I want to open up this Altar for a place for you to get your second wind back if that's you let's just begin like David to find strength in the Lord Our God can we can we come forward those of you that feel like you need your second win from your seat come to the front find a place of prayer we're going to get on a posture of Prayer we're going to get into place of prayer and we're going to seek God we're going to ask him Lord give me my second wind back some of you have experienced loss own it yes it happened to me yes I was abused yes I was taken advantage of yes I was robbed yes I was raped yes I was I was betrayed yes it happened to me own it I lived it I learned from it but you're going to leave it here at this altar you're going to leave it here at this altar right now father I thank you right now that you are in the midst of this place and everything that has happened to us in life Lord you were there you didn't cause it but you were there your arms were always outstretched you protected us Lord we could have been destroyed by what we experienced but God it was your grace oh God it was your grace it was your grace that kept us thank you Lord come on find your strength in the Lord your God find your strength in the Lord your God I just want to begin to pray for some people and other prayer team members can begin to pray and worship team if you want to sing something softly you go ahead and do it", "good morning good morning beautiful people tell your neighbor they're beautiful today unless you're not married to them and don't say that that would be weird yeah so the uh I am uh excited today to join with you at the beginning of 2023. I know that some of you aren't quite sure if you were going to make it here and you did congratulations check made it to 2023. in 1993 which was 30 years ago Bill Murray starred in a classic movie called Groundhog Day if you've not seen it go watch it this afternoon the basic premise was that he had to relive the same day over and over and over and over again until he finally learned his lesson well the past couple of years have had that redo feel to them 2020 started fine pandemic happened [Music] like two weeks in we're like this is horrible we can't wait till this is over in a week and then it didn't happen we were ready for 2021 to be a year of new beginnings and then basically it seemed like 2020 all over again went into 2022 with high hopes but it seemed like the world just kind of stumbled its way along like a drunken sailor through 2022. and here we are again new year fresh hopes dreams gyms everywhere are full to capacity till Monday till tomorrow until tomorrow this year though it seems like it's a little bit less like Groundhog Day and more like a whole bunch of groundhogs I don't I didn't intend to call you groundhogs today but I think I just did the Le the legend of the groundhog is this that as the winter is coming to a close the groundhog carefully peeks its head up out of its slumbering hole sees if it can find its shadow and if spring is coming or if it's still going to be the winter and I want to give you this kind of a spiritual illustration many people have been sitting around like spiritual groundhogs over the last two and a half three years perpetually checking to see if the winter is coming to an end and then slumbering back into their groundhog hole for another season of napping yeah no I'm not nothing wrong with a nap but three years in apps is a long time and I want to tell everybody something today a napping time is over it's time to emerge emerge 2023 somebody say merge come on let's emerge in 2023. it's time to pop up our little groundhog heads up out of the ground it doesn't matter if it's the summer or the fall or the spring or the winter season of your life it's time to stop slumbering and stop just surviving and instead start to thrive to not just poke our heads up out of the hole but it's time to climb up all the way out and embrace that life to Rise Up from the dead with Christ and start living Ephesians chapter 5 says for the light makes everything visible this is why it is said a Waco sleeper Rise Up from the dead and Christ will give you light now I I pray that that is true for your life it may it be true for our church as well let's emerge in 2023 stronger and healthier than ever thriving serving sharing loving giving and recovering in every area emerging full of the spirit of God and wiser than ever before in 2023 you're going to hear about these five initiatives over and over again Bible engagement servanthood financial literacy personal witness of Jesus and men's recovery those are five things we're going to hit hard all year long last week Pastor Emily walk up to this pulpit and absolutely nailed it great job Pastor Emily great job great job now I gotta tell you I love the Bible but Pastor Emily helped me to love the Bible even more and I know that many of you began to really have a thirst to engage with the Bible on a different level as a result of last Sunday we're encouraging everybody in the church to read through the Book of Mark you see the Bible is filled with 66 different books one of them is Mark it's a brief one and I'd encourage you to read that and we also last week received another gift a deep and Abiding Love for authentic and tasty tamales foreign now if you were not here last week because it was January 1st which is a great day to repent by the way just saying it's saying for next year take a moment to watch the sermon from last week on our church YouTube channel as we emerge let me reinforce that no matter how high or fast one emerges if the foundation to that emerging is faulty it will collapse and the foundation of emerging must always be God's word Jesus said this anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise like a person who builds a house on a Rock Solid Rock though the rain comes in Torrance and flood waters rise and the winds beat against the house it won't collapse because it was built on bedrock but anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish like a person who builds a house on sand when the rains and floods come and the winds beat against the house it will collapse with a mighty crash so as we emerge let's spend the time in our life to emerge on the solid rock of God's word I would encourage you to memorize Matthew chapter 7 verse 24 anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise like a person who builds a house on a solid rock now anyone who wants to be wise and I hope that's all of us but anyone who wants to be wise there's two things that we must do according to that scripture we must know the teachings of Jesus and we must follow the teachings of Jesus a lot of people know the teachings of Jesus that does not wake one wise it's the following of those teachings it does so again anyone who listens or knows my teaching so I am aware of the fact that when one reads the Bible or engages with the Bible that it can be a little scary for some of you that you start and you're confused and you're not sure what's going on and the names are weird and the locations are weird and everything's a little different and like you think to yourself why do they always say read the Bible because I don't understand it well I want to give you some tools here today I want you to think of reading the Bible like you're a detective like or you're a private you're a investigative reporter and you're asking questions who what where when why you're asking questions like that you're taking track of the taking note of the things that are unclear or confusing to you the things that are really super interesting you're like wow that's odd uh I want you to think about people and themes and geography and timeline in the moment and if it's a holiday or if it's a day of the week or a historic event why is all that important well here's why it's important most of you were not born Jewish most of you were not born 2 000 years ago most of you were not born in Israel most of us were born with radically different cultures and languages and we would all benefit greatly from engaging with the Bible slowly somebody say slowly engage with the Bible slowly and carefully I'd encourage you with a pen or paper in hand or if you're a digital reader listen with the ability to highlight and take notes or if you're a listener you know take notes however you can I'm going to ask Pastor Jesse to come up onto the stage and join me and I want you to pull out that passage of the Bible that we gave you on your way into Dave it's from Mark chapter six it's that page we're all going to do some little exercise together while you're pulling that out let me tell you a few reasons why it's important to engage with God's word the word of God is how we discover the character of God how we reveal how God Reveals His character the Bible gives us daily instructions for daily life it teaches us how to pray it explains the good news of Jesus it explains us how to tell people about Jesus it teaches us how to trust God the Bible shows us what God's will for our life is if you've been trying to find God's will for your life without the Bible you're going to fall short it's full of God's promises the Bible's historically accurate it teaches us how to forgive some of you might not want to read it if you don't want to learn how to forgive it's full of Truth it asks and answers big questions it's culturally relevant to 2023. it reveals just exactly how much God loves each and every one so everybody pull that out Mark chapter 6. we're going to read it together just Pastor Jesse and I we're going to kind of walk you through how to do this so pull it out so you can see new text normally at this point I put my reading glasses on all right okay so Pastor Jesse there's Mark chapter six Mark is the book that we're reading together as a church but Mark chapter six why don't you go ahead and and slowly read it and I'll pause you at different places and ask you some questions Mark 6 starting at verse 1 says Jesus oh stop Jesus is a person highlight that put parentheses underline it squiggly line it Circle it whatever you want to do okay keep going left that part of the country and returned with his disciples disciples are people too right those were people do whatever you're doing Circle I have it highlighted to Nazareth his home you're reading too fast Pastor Jesse I'm sorry Nazareth is a city it's a village so I don't live in Nazareth until a couple years ago I'd never been to Nazareth I don't know anything about Nazareth except what the Bible says so it's an unfamiliar place so it kind of makes make note of it somehow in your reading slowly go ahead his hometown interesting Nazareth is Jesus hometown the next Sabbath pause a pause in like 17 times and we're not we're just getting into verse two why Sabbath because Sabbath is a day it's a day of the week it matters to the context of the story so you're taking note of it keep going he began teaching in the synagogue no where is he teaching in Seneca what is he doing in the synagogue teaching right okay so you got it you got it so there's stuff going on here it's like church or something keep going and many who heard him were amazed okay it's so easy to skip this it's a sneaky one many is a group of people many were what amazed so the many matters the many matters keep going they asked well now there's a thing there's a many and there's a they apparently two different groups might be important so pay attention where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such Miracles now Miracles is interesting there we're just hearing about miracles now so Miracles are going on somewhere keep going then they score so that they are scoffing if you like Jesus then they're scoffing at Jesus these are problematic people they sound like us I think okay keep going he's just a carpenter what kind of people are these just a carpenter have you ever had to pay a carpenter I mean it's expensive but these people are looking down on this just a carpenter you feel this like he's a second class he's lower class somehow in their societal in their society going the son of Mary Mary I've heard that name before that Jesus is the son of Mary keep going and the brother of James Joseph Judas and Simon wait a second Jesus had Brothers huh he had four brothers listed James Joseph Joseph was probably named after his dad Joseph Judas and Simon just interesting never thought about Jesus having Brothers to beat each other up did Jesus always win so they just left him alone what was the deal what was the deal with that just this is interesting isn't it so there's people there's people there's four guys there they keep going and his sisters oh he had scissors too forba sisters is what plural not just one sister at least two doesn't limit it but four brothers at least two that's at least a family a Sibling Group of Seven this is not a tiny family keep going and his sisters live right here Among Us in Nazareth keep going they were deeply offended there's a day again that they are offended at what Pastor Jesse in his teaching at teaching is miracles why are they so offended keep going and refused to believe in him now the word refused captures my attention it means as an act of their own free will they chose not to believe it's almost like they do believe but they're making themselves not believe that's kind of messed up kind of like when we know God wants us to do something we're like no no I'm not going to do that no I'm refusing I'm refusing to believe that I know God wants me to have a full and Abundant Life I'm not going to do I'm refusing to believe they want that for me profit oh yeah all right a prophet is honored everywhere except in his own Hometown and among his relatives and his own family a lot going on here a lot going on here he's calling them out he's saying you're not welcome me I'm a prophet you're not welcome me in my own hometown even my relatives family the whole thing everybody's being called out keep going and because of their unbelief of their again they they're unbelief he couldn't do any Miracles among them except pause this is one of my favorite verses in the Bible because it's so unusual so Jesus who does Miracles he heals people he delivers people from demonic possession he does Supernatural Miracle the whole thing and here somehow their people's belief and Jesus ability to do things are somehow connected so a lack of belief or an intentional refusal to believe translates into no miracles but because it's Jesus start with accept accept except couldn't do anything except everybody in this room needs to thank God for accept amen okay keep going to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them so because they don't believe Jesus can do anything except heal a few people and he was amazed at their unbelief so Jesus the he he was amazed there people's unbelief now there's a ton of stuff going on there just just six little verses and it and it took us several minutes to get through that it should take you a while to get through the Bible make sure you understand put aside your assumptions make sure you understand so just review who are the who's the in that yep so it starts off with Jesus of Jesus returning with his disciples and then he began teaching in the synagogue where there were many the many and then there was they they and then the other they and then the brothers of Jesus and the sisters and the sisters that's a lot of people and they're like six little verses I don't know any of those people right so when I'm reading the Bible I'm reading about people I don't even know so you kind of have to pause and like okay let's go like when somebody's writing a story and I know in the newspaper and I know all the people I can be very engaged I don't know these people so it's hard for me to stay engaged so I have to capture these things and separate them keep going the the we already got the who's what about the what what's Jesus doing teaching what else is Jesus doing he's performing Miracles healing you know all these things there's some other what's going on what are the people doing they're of being offended and refusing to believe so where is this happening it's happening in Nazareth which we discover is the hometown of Jesus not his birth town but his hometown and where else is it happening in where Pastor Jesse okay I'll go take a snap at it but um he's teaching in a synagogue in a synagogue it's like they're having church this is when this is all happening foreign so when is it happening on the Sabbath day but there's another unspoken time when it's happening it's happening after something and before something Jesus had just left the region of Capernaum which was a few hours away and he's walked over hiked over to his hometown so he left one region and came to Nazareth is there anything that's unclear or confusing in the text to you the reasoning for their response yeah why were they offended that's that's unclear to me why why why are these people offended Jesus was doing good stuff why are they so offended there's an answer to that then why did they refuse why did they intentionally refuse to believe that's there's something important in that I'm not going to tell you what it is I'm just letting you know there's something important about that there's some other interesting things as well what did you what did you see anything else interesting uh for me is is how much unbelief a person needs to have to amaze defense oh they didn't just have regularly they had heavy unbelief he probably came in suspecting there was going to be some but to be there that much to the point where he was amazed yeah um I found it interesting I'm less spiritual than Pastor Jesse I just found it interesting that Jesus had brothers and sisters okay um I found it interesting that because of the unbelief Jesus couldn't do certain Miracles among them except to place his hands on a few people and heal them so then there's the why then there's the why now so when you're looking at this one of the whys here is that Jesus is intentionally going to his hometown of Nazareth to declare to his relatives and family this statement a prophet is honored everywhere except in his own Hometown and among his relatives in his own family he was doing that he was going there to make sure that the people he grew up with new that the stuff they were hearing about him was true he really was healing and delivering all that kind of stuff that he had a powerful Teaching Ministry and that when they heard that he was claiming to be the Messiah The Rescuer of the nation of the people that they were hearing correctly that that's exactly who Jesus is and was it's the equivalent of Jesus saying hey by the way Town folks family friends aunts and uncles brothers and sisters I am who people have been saying that I am and you all need to get your act together because you all know me and I know you and then he walked away thank you thank you Pastor Jesse Yeah so now here's some takeaways so the point is that it takes a minute to read the Bible to engage with the Bible and so engage with it gauge with it here's a here's a couple of takeaways that I have from that little passage one are there any things that Jesus does that offend me what does Jesus do that offends me I came up with a few things I'm not telling you what they are but I came up with a few things am I refusing to believe in Jesus in any area of my life or am I refusing Jesus what he said will I be the many who are amazed will I be the they that refuse to believe or will I be the disciple that follows so that's a takeaway for me and that's that's just a way to go about reading or engaging with the Bible and we got all the way through six verses six verses in fact I'm gonna make sure that you understand this when you read the Bible in the Bible there's going to be like these little headings the chapter number six the verses the ones and the little statements it says on your paper Jesus rejected at Nazareth I just want you to make sure you know that's not the Bible like why is it in the Bible if it's not the Bible because there was a group of people a long time ago that decided they were going to separate things into chapters and verses and then we're going to put little headings to try to help you understand I just want to give you a hint they're not always right the headings aren't always right so the headings not the Bible the Bible is the Bible so make sure you make sure that you know that okay so that's the knowing just lower knowing we're engaging we're making progress on that but it also says he who listens to my teaching and follows it is why somebody say follows follows in his wise like a person who builds house on the solid rock so let's push into this idea for a moment about following Jesus what does it mean to follow Jesus what does followership of Jesus look like I'm so happy you asked because Jesus answered this question exactly Mark chapter 8 then calling the crowd to join his disciples he said if any of you it still applies to us today if any of you wants to be my follower you must give up your own way take up your cross and follow me the crowd probably was like what'd he say give up my own way I got to give up my own way and take up a cross do you know what they do to people on the cross they execute them Jesus is saying to the people give up your own life your own way you're going to have to choose a different way and it's not yours taking up the cross this was a common form of Roman execution and oppression Jesus is both figuratively and literally saying if you want to follow Jesus it means giving up your own life your own claims on your own life what does that mean what your life was what it is and what it was going to be in order to follow Jesus you have to give it all up to follow is to lay down your life to lay down your personal preferences the things you like and the things you don't like lay down your political agendas careful careful pastor but lay down your political agendas your worldly philosophies your sociological preferences lay down your personal history lay down your successes lay down your failures lay down your baggage lay down your grudges lay down your past lay down your present lay down your future and choose the way of Jesus that's what's being said here to what end Jesus answered that as well if you try to hang on to your life you will lose it but if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the good news you will save it and what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul is anything worth more than your soul if anyone is ashamed of me and my message and these adulterous and sinful days it's like it was written today the son of man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels so question the big Center question is is there anything worth more than your soul of course not is the answer to summarize does the worship team comes up to build our life on the solid rock of Jesus we must know what Jesus says and we must put down our life the claims on our life and pick up the way of Jesus which is the way of the cross that's what this is all about to know and to follow today we are going to close the service by celebrating communion together communion is just the remembrance of what Jesus did for us where he literally gave his body and blood on a cross he was executed on a cross unjustly for us taken upon himself all of our sins all of our shame and then raising from the dead three days later give us the opportunity to be forgiven of our sins and to follow him in an abundant life in communion the bread represents the body of Jesus and the Jews represents the blood of Jesus one day Jesus performed this amazing miracle of feeding more than 5 000 people with just five loaves of bread and two fish Jesus goes off and comes back and the next day the people come back looking for Jesus apparently they're hoping for a snack from Jesus John chapter 6 verse 26 Jesus replied I tell you the truth you want to be with me because I fed you they want some goodies from Jesus he then begins to teach them in order to thin out the crowd the crowd's going to not stay at five thousand it's going to thin out because he's going to start to teach some hard things like lay down your life [Music] well he says in John chapter 6 verse 53 he says I tell you the truth unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you cannot have eternal life within you Jesus is not promoting vampirism in this text it's an it's a it's a illustration that you're going to have to experience all of what Jesus experienced but anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise that person in the last day for my flesh is True Food and my blood is true drink anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him I live because the living father who set me in the same way anyone who feeds on me will live because of me I am the true bread that came down from heaven anyone who eats this bread will not die as your ancestors did even though they ate the manna but will live forever Jesus is saying hey that that Manna in the Old Testament that Miracle story of God providing for the people the bread I'm the bread I'm the bread of life he was making it known to all who would listen that he was the bread of life Manna From Heaven the hope of the world that anybody who was thirsty could come to him and find drink and life through Jesus and that promise that Jesus was making 2000 years ago that promise is still available to us today and so today we invite in this room in our online service over in Revere we invite you to hear the call of Jesus today to come to drink the juice to eat the bread to invite Jesus to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life and as you come to the communion table today come and receive the elements and spend some time laying down your life and picking up true life in Jesus Christ ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life why don't you stand with me as we close [Music] so as you're coming up in just a moment I want you to wrestle with this these two questions [Music] what in your life today do you need to lay down in order to pick up Jesus what do you need to surrender in order to soar so at this time you can come receive the elements and when you are ready on your own you can take them and I'll close in prayer after this", "right good morning everybody good morning all right there you are I see you see you um so let me uh set this up uh we're still in our Finger of God series but right before we get there uh I want to talk to you just for a second just real super practical how to get the most out of your worship experience okay how to get the most out of your Sunday morning uh worship experience and the the first thing we'll talk about this this week we'll talk about the concept of preparation somebody say preparation preparation so just being prepared in Luke chap 23 it says it was preparation day and the Sabbath was about to begin amen so in case you don't know this back then it was the the Sabbath was the they celebrated on Saturday and then they had a day before the Sabbath so they had this holy day and then they had a day to prepare for the holy day so it was really two days okay it wasn't just one day it was two days and so they had this preparation day and there's this idea that in order to successfully worship it is it's most successful it's most helpful if you've prepared if you've prepared your heart for example so how do you best prepare yourself for corporate worship is the first thing you do is you prepare your heart somebody say heart heart so you prepare your heart through prayer you prepare your heart through expectation like what you're going to expect so if you came to church today expecting a miracle you might walk out with a miracle if you if you walked in today expecting you're like you don't even know what you were expecting you're not actually sure where you're at today you probably won't get a miracle come on now for real like that's kind of like there's this sense of expectation that that you're you're preparing yourself for like oh God is working with me on something I'm going in it doesn't even matter what the sermon is I'm going in with Jesus today all right I when I was a youth pastor I used to say this to my teenagers listen I don't care if the altar calls about an ingrown toenail you get up to the Altar and get right with Jesus and make things right you go so um you know and like you're preparing yourself like with pre- worship like an appetizer before a nice meal okay you're pre- worship like you're like uh like is playing some worship music or you're singing or may or maybe so you're doing all that kind of stuff so or then you're preparing your family so if it's just you that's a little bit easier but if there's some other people you're preparing your family your kids we've made this really easy for you okay for real you don't have to dress up to come to East Coast International [Applause] Church you can bless me all day long for that right you know you you you don't got to dress up you don't have to think about it like and some of you test us on that some of you always trying to dress up I'm like why are you dressed up you're messing us up you you're messing up the vibe you're messing us up up here why you trying to make us look bad okay you don't have to dress up you don't have to spend 3 hours get getting your kids ready like you don't have to be all stressed out about it just come to church just come to church right so you're just you're getting your family ready though and maybe maybe the night before you read a Bible story or or or or devotional story or maybe maybe you're just impressing your kids with the word of God like maybe like like you know you tell them your favorite Bible story maybe you're not actually reading it from the Bible maybe you just tell it to them maybe it's just in the car like when my kids disrespect me I remind them I'm the I'm the prophet of God and bears are going to come out and get you all right and like you know so that's true that's a true story the um um so another way is giving uh so if you're if you're going to prepare successfully you're like set aside what you're going to give right so you're not being compelled like you're not you're not being your arms aren't being twisted or or anything to give so so if you're like rushing like I don't even know what to get what am I supposed to do listen just just stop just wait prepare yourself give next week uh prepare yourself what it is that you're going to do okay in fact I know this for a fact the majority of the giving that comes in here is given through planned prepared giving okay and so people have made a decision in their heart they and God have decided and then they they strategically give throughout the year okay so we're not going to twist your arms it's just something that you're going to do between you and God then there's there's really practical stuff really really practical stuff we used to say when I was younger Saturday Night Live Sunday morning late yeah I don't know if you ever heard that like Saturday Night Live Sunday morning late I know that's not a thing in a modern world where you can watch Saturday Night Live at you know 9:00 in or at noon or whenever it doesn't matter the uh but in other words just get to bed early enough like if you're preparing yourself prepare yourself prepare yourself like if it's 3 in the morning you're like I'm going to the 9:45 service no you're not no you're not I don't even want you to come to the 9:45 come to the 11 I think we had some people that went to bed at 3:00 in the 9:45 service today it was pretty rough in the 9:45 the worship team said amen all right [Music] so sorry 9:45 service but it was rough it was rough you know leaving the house on time like leaving the house on time to find listen to find parking I mean we don't really have a real parking lot right so to find parking to check the kids in to have some conversations with some friends on the way in that means if you come into the 11:00 service you don't leave leave the house at 11:01 right maybe you're leaving at 10:30 right you're coming you know maybe that's not even enough time I don't know I I come here at 7:30 or 8 you know so I'm here early so you know you're making sure that your employer respects the Sacred Space that you've set and listen nobody's going to respect your Sacred Space unless you make them respect your Sacred Space that's true you have to make it so you have to push back okay um you know getting up when your alarm tells you to get up all that kind of stuff and not trying to do a million things before church that doesn't usually end up well what's what's happening why because your your attitude gets messed up things get in the way and it gets distracting and then you're thinking about a million things when you come to church uh and all of that and you're turning your cell phone ringer off that's just for me but that helps my experience uh in church okay and it helps some of your friends out in church as well and so that gets us to this category of helping other people out helping other people out how to make a really good worship experience is you're helping other people out as well for example if you're a smoker we love you for real we might love you more um but please smoke away from the building okay now stop keep it to yourself amen keep that to yourself but smoke away from the building because because here's why we have dozens of people actively trying to stop smoking and the last thing they need is to arrive through like a nicotine cloud or a weed cloud or whatever kind of cloud it is that's out there right I don't need it and they don't need you like hey do you want one to like they're trying to stop just stop just stop okay um and so just just go away um we understand that it takes some time to stop and all that kind of stuff so we're not we're not trying to squash you or anything just but but please help help your neighbor out parking uh make it your mission to park far away oh yeah because that helps other people out okay so please please do that and then notice this we have some growth Trends perhaps you haven't noticed but since the pandemic it took us a while for things to start getting back to normal now we're getting close to back to what we would call normal and for the last couple of years things have been growing again increasing the number of people attending services in person and we have reason to believe that that will continue to grow uh signific ific L over the next year actually at a much more significant rate so be open to that be welcoming to other people be friendly I'm talking to you new englanders be friendly okay I think you're super friendly it doesn't bother me I think you're great okay um be curious okay that's you know be curious um be sensitive to each other listen if you didn't notice we don't all look the same come on now all right we don't I don't this is a funny story I I get on a plane in a couple of hours I'm getting on a plane to go to Atlanta Georgia to speak at the national black [Applause] conference that funny I got the invitation I'm like do you want me to be the Usher I'm happy to funny um we don't all look the same we come from different backgrounds I mean we got a lot of different backgrounds we have a lot of country backgrounds and socioeconomic backgrounds and so so be open be sensitive all that kind of stuff and then remember this and this is really important particularly for the next several months remember this if you claim Jesus you are part of the kingdom of Jesus I know sometimes you get confused about that therefore the kingdom of America and its partisan politics should not be your primary concern so let's keep our political party preferences and candidates out of our corporate worship experience okay so that really is going to help each other out so Pastor David actually has t-shirts for those of you that forget that to hand out to you to help you change uh on on the way in okay so uh if that ever were to happen so that's just help so that's just repairing uh setting the stage for for helpful and positive worship experiences so uh we're back to the Finger of God series now 740 years uh 700 somebody say Finger of God finger God okay so this is the last in the series um I love this series Pastor David did a great job last week thank you Pastor David I was thank you all right all right I was watching online last week um and I have no idea why people go to church online all right I have no idea I'm I was driving I'm I was drive that's why I was driving and watching I was driving and watching that's probably why so um 740 years before the birth of Jesus there was a man named Isaiah that began to Prof prophesy in one of these prophecies he speaks of a coming Kingdom of a messiah one who will bring Salvation and in that time he says this Isaiah 35 then will the eyes of the blind be open and the ears of the deaf unstopped then will the lame leap like a deer and the mute tongue shout for Joy pay particularly close attention to the deaf and the mute part there okay um now and that c sounds like a lot of stuff that we know about Jesus uh on from this side of history now you fast forward all the way to the time of Jesus and there's this interesting episode in the in the life of Jesus that sounds like a whole lot like part of the prophecy that Isaiah talked about so we're in Mark uh Mark is this this guy that absolutely loved telling stories about how Jesus loved both Jews and non-jews which are called Gentiles and and so so he he writes this and he writes in Mark 7:31 it says Jesus left TI and went up to sidon before going back to the Sea of Galilee and the region of the 10 Towns which is called the decapolis a deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him and the people begged Jesus to lay hands on the man to heal him Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone he put his fingers into the man's ears right then sitting on his own fingers he touched the Man's Tongue looking up to heaven he sighed and said AA which means be opened instantly the man could hear perfectly and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly Jesus Took The Crow Jesus told the crowd not to tell anybody but the more he told them not to the more they spread the news they were completely amazed and said again and again everything he does is wonderful he even makes the deaf to hear and he gives speech to to those who cannot speak so at surface it actually sounds a lot like many of the other stories or encounters that Jesus has uh with people that are infirmed okay it sounds like a very very similar kind of story in verse 31 it says Jesus left the vicinity of of of Ty I want you go ahead and put the map on the screen left the vicinity of Ty and went through sidon down to the Sea of of Galilee and into the region of the decapolis okay or the 10 cities so just for the sake of understanding the story you need to actually understand a little bit of geography I apologize that you need to know this but you do the Orange is the decapolis the orange on the screen is the decapolis if you're color blind it's the thing with the circles around it okay so the uh you have the uh the orange part there uh is the decapolis and then you have those two bodies of water the Sea of Galilee the Dead Sea with the little river in between that's the Jordan River okay everything to the left or to the west of that body of water uh of the river is what we'll call Israel and and everything above the Sea of Galilee and to the left is uh basically not Israel these are very very generic okay uh um ideas and so everything to the east or to the right of that river is essentially not first century Israel it's the decapus this matters so Ty and sidon are North of Israel the decapolis is east of Israel the 10 cities are east of Israel this matters so Jesus had been in Ty Jesus had been in sidon and now he's in the in the decapolis region none of these are Israel all of these are non-jewish regions all of these are Gentile and Pagan regions verse 32 a deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him and the people begged Jesus to lay his hands on men uh the man to heal him but when the people begged him to lay hands on him which means they knew who he was sort of all right when Jesus arrives at the decapolis people were aware of who Jesus was they had heard about Jesus yeah how did they know about Jesus already this this really matters how in the world did they know about Jesus this was the the decapolis was next to first century Israel but it wasn't Israel it was the almost the opposite of it these were Gentiles on the other side of the Jordan they were not waiting for a messiah all right they did not have the law and the prophets they did not have what what we refer to as the Old Testament they didn't have that all right they were just doing all kinds of pagan stuff out there they didn't have any of it how in the world did they know about Jesus there was this man that had previously been filled with demons a lot of them and he had been delivered of demons just a few weeks or a few months earlier we don't exactly know the timeline but in Mark chap 5 we see the story of Jesus cross in the seed delivering this man of of a ton of demons and they get cast into the pigs and the pigs go over the cliff if you're familiar with the Bible you know that story but then in verse 20 at the end of that story and it connects to this one it says so the man started off to visit the 10 Towns right here on the orange or that were on the map of that region and began to proclaim the great things Jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed at what he told them so go back to the map on the map the guy the demoniac had been that was completely delivered starts wandering around to the 10 Towns telling everybody hey remember me I'm not the same as I used to be and it says in M Mark 5:20 and everyone was amazed at what he told them like what we know you because you were crazy because the preaching of the demoniac who had been set free was very effective his ministry was effective because he had been delivered authentically delivered and because he remained delivered his checkered past actually helped amen because he wasn't checkered anymore all right now some people have checkered past and then they stay checkered ain't nobody got time for that okay for real they were like they had a check pass they try to tell you how they got delivered and they still checkered just keep it closed okay so the former demoniac was telling a story he was living a story he was a physical object lesson of the love and power of God to a group of non-jewish religious pagans who were in fact looking for authentic power and authentic love so Jesus is on his pigs pagans and Gentiles tour okay I'm going to make a t-shirt about that that's cool right 33 ad making sure that Ty and sidon and the 10 cities of the decapolis are not forgotten to make it known that the spiritually forgotten have in fact always been known by God and never forgotten and that he has actually been on his way to them for a very long time Jesus is making it clear that to the spiritually lost God has always had a plan to find you and that as this man in the story's ears are and speech are restored they now know that Jesus is the way and that he is the one to truly follow so they are no longer spiritually lost and they are no longer forgotten because they never were amen verse 32 it says there some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk and They begged Jes Jesus to place his hand on him now these friends here at the beginning clearly they they love this man this deaf and mute man they loved him enough to make a special effort to get him to Jesus they had a dream for their friend a dream which just said if we could just get him to Jesus then we could ask Jesus and Jesus might heal him and listen these friends the only thing they knew about Jesus was that there's this guy named Jesus that completely changed the life of our demoniac friend amen and we don't know what that's all about totally but he did it for him maybe he can do it for us am and so he they bring this guy they bring him and there's this emerging Faith happening right it's like okay we got to see what this is all about and these friends they come they share their faith with their their emerging Faith with their deaf and and uh a mute friend or the man of the speech impediment and they they wanted him to obtain his own faith in Jesus and and the faith of these friends was passed on to this man which then allowed him to stand before Jesus with a sure confidence that Jesus would and could in fact heal him that's that's a lot of stuff going on for people that weren't waiting for Jesus just a couple of weeks ago or a couple of months ago verse 33 after he took him aside so this is Jesus Jesus Takes the man he took him aside away from from the crowd he's alone with Jesus it's a very interesting thing that Jesus does in pulling the man aside and whenever these moments happen in the Bible I I just pause and I say why why are we why are we reading this why does it matter why does it matter that Jesus Took the man aside uh it likely would not be there if it didn't matter and I asked the question why well I think I think it's very possible that the reason that he took the man aside is because uh crowds have a way of distracting you from Jesus amen amen sometimes that you just need to get alone uh to be with Jesus I know that sometimes after a really powerful move of God here in the church I just need to go get alone I just need to go get alone with Jesus uh because there's this interesting mix and balance between being both together with Jesus and alone with Jesus uh it's it's fascinating how it's all connected but you need both you need to both be together with Jesus and alone with Jesus and in certain moments the multitude has a way of keeping you distracted or preoccupied with its own agenda God on the other hand has a way of leading Us beside Steel Waters Hallelujah place of solitude where we can have our H H our undivided attention between us and God in verse 33 it says Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone he put his fingers into the man's ears Hallelujah then spitting on his own fingers he touched the Man's Tongue we'll get to that weird part later he has comp so Jesus he has compassion on the masses all the time we see this he he has compassion compassion but then there's these moments when he just touches you but that's just you and Jesus it's just it's just it's just a touch from Jesus for you but I will tell you this I know this for a fact it requires you to be spiritually and emotionally vulnerable for you to be willing to step away away from the crowd to get alone with authentically alone with Jesus to let Jesus touch you and it's really this kind of spiritually important moment where you spiritually put it all on the line it's just you and Jesus and I tell you I have moments in my life where I it's just got to be me and Jesus it can't be me Jesus and 17 other people it's just got to be me and Jesus now I have these pivot moments in my life these very significant moments of my life where it couldn't be me Jesus and a crowd it had to just be me and Jesus me and a Geo Prism in an old parking lot waiting until God showed up amen if you ever had a Geo Prism you know how miserable that is or sitting in the edge of a Woods next to a cornfield for hours just alone with Jesus or in this room late late on a s Saturday night or early Sunday morning when everybody else is in bed alone with Jesus one time I could not figure it out how to get alone with Jesus so I left the country and went to a side of a volcano to spend some time completely alone with Jesus where I would not be distracted by anything or anyone else that's some add issues going on right there other times I've been alone with Jesus in the midst of hundred hundreds or thousands of people it was just me and Jesus amen sometimes there can be other people around and you'll just be paying attention to God and God alone but here's what I know that that takes some time for many people that there is this emotional and spiritual vulnerability it is hard for some sometimes we we would rather be with the crowd going to God rather than alone with God because sometimes it's easier to come close to God with a group than by yourself because when you're by yourself feels extremely vulnerable feels extremely naked which is in fact the entire point because the truth is it's hard but it's the very thing that brings the greatest freedom I want to I just want to encourage you today if when Jesus calls you out of the crowd when he pulls you aside just go amen Don't Be Afraid Just Go With Jesus when Jesus pulls this man aside the first thing he does in this moment of spiritual and emotional vulnerability he's all by himself with Jesus is Jesus says let me put my fingers in your ears boom and he spits on his fingers and grabs his tongue the Bible as the worship team comes up the Bible just kind of keeps on cruising does not stop to address does not say in a footnote anywhere Jesus being extra weird In This Moment nothing nothing like this at all on the surface we just have to admit this seems strange to us I don't have really many other ways to explain it other than it's kind of weird right to us it's always going to seem kind of weird but there is something more significant going on here remember we're in the Finger of God series what's really happening here is that the Finger of God has shown up once again because everything Jesus does is on purpose and this is what we are supposed to see we are supposed to see that the Finger of God that set the Israelites free in Egypt all the way back in Exodus the Finger of God that wrote the Ten Commandments back in Exodus the Finger of God that gave the Ten Commandment the the the Finger of God that brought judgment upon Bazar that Pastor David talked about last week the Finger of God that set the woman caught in adultery free the Finger of God that cast out the demons is here once again the power and authority of God the king of all Kings and the Lord of all Lords is Manifest in Jesus and the finger this is the point the finger of Jesus is in fact the Finger of God so Jesus looking up to heaven he sighed and said AA which means be opened instantly the man could hear perfectly and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly Hallelujah the Finger of God yes is good news for the poor it heals the broken yes it frees the captive and it brings Justice to the oppressed verse 37 they were completely amazed and said again and again again these are religious pagans just meeting Jesus for the first time everything he does is wonderful he even makes the deaf to hear and give speech to those who cannot speak right accidentally partially quoting this ancient Prophecy from Isaiah these former pagans are speaking out that fulfillment of that prophecy would you stand with me as we close so let me ask you today [Music] just want you to wrestle with this will you let the Finger of God touch your [Music] life you let the Finger of God touch your life today so who are you who are you in this story are you the one that needs to stop hiding from your past and let God use your story of transformation to change lives like the demoniac that was formerly a demoniac or are you the one who needs needs to bring a friend to Jesus are you the one who needs to be willing to get alone with Jesus are you the one who today needs to be willing to let Jesus touch you yes and Let Jesus put his fingers in your ears Hallelujah the worship team will close this the altars are open let's spend some time responding to this uh", "what think about it in your mind what happens if you were to try to deceive God what if you tried lying to God what if you tried to deceive God what's the outcome of of deceiving God or attempting to deceive God as though he could be deceived well let's find out we're going to read really one of my favorite passages of scripture when I was a young person not sure why this is one of my favorite passages but it was Acts chapter 5 there was just maybe there's a lot of action inside of this there was a certain man named ananas who with his wife saf sold some property he brought part of the money to the Apostles of the church claiming it was the full amount with his wife's consent he kept the rest it's a naughty then Peter said who was the leader of the church ananas why have you let Satan fill your heart you lied to the Holy Spirit and you kept some of the money for yourself the property was yours to sell or not sell as you wished and after selling it the money was also yours to give away how could you do a thing like this you weren't lying to us but to God so we're about to find out what happens when you lie to God as soon as ananas heard these words he fell to the floor and died that's rough just died God smoted him everywhere who everyone who heard about it was terrified then some young men got up up wrapped him in a sheet and took him out and buried him about 3 hours later his wife came in not knowing what had happened Peter asked her was this the price you and your husband received for your land yes she replied that was the price if you don't know the story you could probably Guess How It Ends and Peter said how could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the spirit of the Lord like this this the young men who buried your husband are just outside the door door and they will carry you out too instantly she fell to the floor and died when the young man came in and saw that she was dead They carried her out and buried her beside her husband great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened oh this kind of one of those yikes passages in scriptures yikes so let's recap two people gave an offering and got smoke them obviously there's a little bit more to it than that like there was lying and deception involved and so in their attempt to deceive God we learn some things about about uh about God his relationship to the church our response to God lots of different things going on here but one of the things I want you to pay attention to is that there's always going to be somebody trying to manipulate the church and we're talk when we say the church today we're talking about The Universal Church like the the body of Christ the the the church throughout the entire world not just here but we always see that people are going to be trying to manipulate the church deceiving using the church to try to deceive unsuspecting people uh pretending to be one thing in order to get something that they want like I'm always intrigued at who shows up to church when they're trying to impress a potential significant other just curious if that's you today I do not have you in my mind it's just something that happens attempting to give the uh uh pretending to be one thing in order to get something else that they want now ananas and Safa they were attempting to give the appearance of radical generosity when in fact their deceitful plan stood as the opposite of the church's faith-filled generosity and Brotherly Love they saw an opportunity for personal gain and were literally willing to disrupt the pure Unity of the church in this absolutely historic moment they were willing to train wreck what God was doing for their own personal game and at this particular moment the church was in the very beginning of this amazing Revival that would change the whole world and here we have two Knuckleheads try to take advantage of that moment for themselves inside of the story you have a husband and a wife and husband lies first and then is dead three hours later the wife comes in and she dies but don't miss right before the wife dies there's this moment of Grace and generosity from God in the account you see she's given a chance to come clean and she doesn't when Peter asked her if this was the whole deal she could have said no and then the story would have taken a very different turn so what's the point here be careful who influences you be careful who you follow you don't want to be following somebody that's going off a cliff and then going off right behind him we all have situations in our life when we listened to somebody or followed somebody and it led to regret like we wish we hadn't but we did and often times you can look back and say I had my chances to get out and I didn't along the way so take your chance to get out when you have it ananas and Safara it's important to note were part of that church the earliest church but they had clearly neglected to put on the full armor of God and because of that they had become come deceived they had become deceived by the enemy to serve the enemy's purposes instead of the purposes of God within the church and on some level I think we can all attend to our own Hearts after reading this account we should check our own Hearts our own lives do I have deceit in my heart do I have lying in my heart do I have corruption in my heart have you ever said to God God I will give you my all I will give you everything God everything I have all that is within me and then you wake up the next morning and you can't remember what happened the day before you know that is something that's real where we are duplicitous we are deceitful even to ourselves sometimes have you ever drawn a public Line in the Sand and said never again only to be secret secretely involved in it still or have you ever presented yourself as one way fully knowing that it is not who you really are because you are secretly enticed with other sins now those are all forms of lying and deceit these things are not really a lot different than what ananas and Safa did we can learn from the story that manipulating the church was clearly frowned upon by God because of his very aggressive response there's another thing we can pay attention to here that was what I would call Unholy influence Unholy influence people still try to do this today they still try to have an Unholy influence on the church or people around them sometimes it's knowingly sometimes it's unknowingly trying to be all half holy in half hood right so I don't know if you know this but this is a thing being half holy holy half hood you might even have a t-shirt that says half holy half hood all right you need to delete the half Hood part I know it sounds funny when we say it but the reality is it's an intentional lack of willingness to go all in yeah I mean we're not supposed to be half hood we're supposed to be all holy and so it's not a point of Pride to say hey I'm half holy half hood be careful of me all right I well I should be careful of you because you are Unholy not because of the Hood part I can deal with the Hood part people trying to gain influence and Unholy influence so that they get power or Prestige or popularity with no interest in the real mission of the church it's subtle but it's real and it ranges from things like predatory people trying to connect with somebody using the church to try to make themselves out to be extra Christian you know ex you got like a a dating profile out there that makes you look like extra Christian you're looking for that extra Christian person be careful or there was a time when people would actually join a church because a certain church because of its political or cultural status in that Community with no sense of what they actually believed it was just some type of public ritual throughout the ages there have even been political leaders that have professed faith in Christ solely for the purpose of gaining influence over people that are F followers of Christ trying to have an Unholy influence there's even in world today there are still countries in the world today where the leaders of those countries appoint the leaders of the church in that country that's a real thing that happens you got some presidents some prime ministers some dictators choosing the church leaders in certain countries that's messed up people trying to have an Unholy influence on the church more than once I've heard people refer to the story of ananas and Safa with kind of a a little giggle or a little laugh an uncomfortable laugh like I'm glad God still doesn't strike people today dead for lying like one of those numbers well I'm not so sure that he doesn't it seems to me that the wages of Deceit are still death and maybe it doesn't show up fully as the immediate death of the body but perhaps it's a death of something else maybe it's the death of a marriage where falsehoods and deceit and lie have just torn away at the foundation maybe it's the death of a conscience because we all know that after the first lie the second lie is easier maybe it's a death of a career after someone has been caught cheating or embezzling or deceiving maybe it's the death of Faith because simply have deceived yourself for far too long we could go so far as to talk about the deaths of intimacy or death of trust or peace or credibility and even self-respect so is their death from deceit and lying absolutely dishonesty can affect and infect every aspect of our life so maybe one of the takeaways here today is this in what area of your life do you need to clean up deceitfulness or clean up lying or corruption how do you do that well first you ask the Holy Spirit you ask the spirit of God to point out any deceitfulness in your life and pray for the courage to remove it because that's the hard part the courage to remove it so for ananas and saf it wasn't the moment of money it wasn't the amount of money or even the splitting of that money that was the problem it was the lying and manipulating and deceitfulness around it that was the problem and that has been the strategy of Satan from the very beginning of the church from the very beginning Satan has been the enemy of the church has been trying to embed individuals with Unholy agendas into the body to try and disrupt the pure mission of Jesus wherever you have the pure mission of Jesus happening wherever you have the preaching of good news to the poor and the healing of the broken and the freeing of the captives and justice for the oppressed you will have the enemy trying to disrupt and deceive and uh be have an Unholy influence in that place so God establishes from the very beginning of the church a sacredness to the church it is supposed to be holy God has what I would call a hands-off policy on the church in other words if you mess with the church there will literally be hell to pay right it may seem in the moment like you got your way but in the end God always protects his church Jesus said to Peter one of the early church leaders now I say to you that you are Peter which means Rock and Upon This Rock I will build my church and all the powers of Hell will not conquer it notice it said all all the powers of Hell will not conquer it that means that the powers of hell are going to try and conquer the church but they won't Prevail they will not win they will not win the war they may win a battle or two along the way but in the end they will not win the war because this is ultimately God's Church even those that seem to get away with corrupting the church ultimately face a final and very unfortunate judgment now early in the history of the church the early followers of Jesus lived in what we call a radical generosity they would make sure that everybody in the church and in their midst had exactly what they needed they made sure they shared and they they combined things and they just made sure everybody was taken care of in today's world in 2023 we live in a very different world a with a very broken economic system and having what you need in Lynn is very different it's not just food right it's not just hey we got to make sure everybody can eat it's a lot more than that that's part of it but it's not everything you have housing and education and trade Career Development and literacy and mentoring this is literally why we're doing the center the Centro El Centro Acts chapter 4 says this watch what happened in the early church the generosity it says for instance there was Joseph the one the apostles nicknam Barnabas which means son of encouragement he was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus we know a lot about him at this point not sure why we have to know all of that but we do he sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles he sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles meaning he brought it as an offering he here we have Barnabas living out radical generosity property ownership was a big deal at the time honestly property ownership is still a big deal today and so what Barnabas did was he sold something that helped him make a living so that he could make a difference that's what he did he said I want to make this difference in my community and so I'm going to sell this thing that I have this asset this property so that I can make this difference it was a significant personal sacrifice and the scriptures in Acts it tells us this was happening all over the place this is what was occurring in the church they were making sure the needs were taken care of throughout scripture there are multiple moments when we learn about what God thinks about giving his concerns towards giving he talk there's lots of stuff in the Bible about giving and and all these things and there's a few principles there's three particular principles I want to highlight here today the first one is this the the principle of participation somebody say participation particip see not everybody participated right there some of you said participation and some of you are like I wish he would not ask us to say stuff in church on Sundays you did not participate so you did not get the you did not get the benefit and the joy of fully participating with that but but part participate giving participation matters in the Old Testament there's this moment when the the people of God are building the temple they're going to have this place to worship they're so excited they're going to have this place to worship and everybody jumps in and they bring gold and silver to the temple in fact if you want this is not a joke if you want you can bring gold and silver and we will sell it for real we've done this multiple times over the years um because that that boyfriend or girlfriend that gave you that necklace that you like don't even want it's like buried you haven't seen it for 36 years like like give it to Jesus it's okay it's okay um and we'll we'll make sure the last time we did this we had like we had a whole bunch of gold and silver jewelry that people had brought in it was great only to find out like half of it wasn't gold and silver we'll just we just let people think it was gold and silver you know it was pretty rough the uh like a lot of people being lied to out there is what I'm saying um 1 Chronicles chapter 29 then the family about the temple then the family leaders the leaders of the tribes of Israel the generals and captains of the Army and the King's uh administrative officers all gave willingly notice it says they all all gave willingly so there's participation all gave willingly for the construction of the temple of God they gave about 188 tons of gold 10,000 gold coins 375 tons of silver 67 5 tons of bronze and 3,750 tons of iron they had a good accounting person as well they also contributed numerous precious stones which were deposited in the treasury of the house of the Lord under the care of j a descendant of gon verse n it says the people rejoiced over the offerings for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the Lord and King David was filled with joy verse nine is really important talks about their rejoicing they rejoiced because they were all able to participate they Rejoice because they were all in this thing together they were building a place of worship and they were so excited about it they had what they needed it was a time of Celebration and that is a critical principle when it comes to giving and pursuing the mission of Jesus I want you to notice that what they gave was tangible right actually was like something they could touch that that would matter this is a form of currency back in it as well they didn't just send good energy I don't know if this ever happened to you before but this week somebody sent me good energy actually what they sent me was real good energy they're sending you real good energy I can I just tell you I did I didn't know what to do with that real good energy what am I supposed to do with this good energy it's kind of like thoughts and prayers listen you can keep your thoughts I want your prayers but you can keep your thoughts it's like energy for me like I I mean I can't do anything with that energy I got plenty of energy already I don't think I need your real good energy as well I know what they were saying I was just being ordinary participation was something they could be joyful because they were all participating second thing is the heart matters notice this in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 remember this a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop but the one who plants generously will get a generous crop you must each decide in your heart how much to give and don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure so like don't don't let your emotions be manipulated for God gives a person who gives God loves a person who gives cheerfully and God will generously provide all you need then you will always have everything you need plenty left over to share with others so in just a minute when I ask you to contribute financially to the center or elro El cenro we're not going to be twisting your arms it's just an opportunity for you because it's a matter of your heart and what you want to do the third principle here is sacrifice Luke 21 as the people were giving their offerings and they would come they would literally come to the front so they' go to the offering box and they would all drop it in so everybody could see what they were doing while Jesus was in the temple he watched the rich people dropping their gifts in the collection box then a poor Widow came by and dropped in two small coins I tell you the truth Jesus said this poor Widow has given more than all the rest of them for they have given a tiny part of their Surplus but she poor as she is has given everything she has here we see that the Widow gave her her heart she participated and she sacrificed she sacrificed in a way that the others had not sacrificed and Jesus was calling this out as an act of Holiness and righteousness years ago we had a kind and quirky older lady here in the church so after you die I can say these things about you okay so kind and quirky a kind and quirky older lady in the church and she decided that I needed cold water every Sunday morning and so every Sunday morning she would bring me a bottle of cold water what she would do is she'd take that bottle of water and she would put it in the freezer the night before and she would bring it to me um and so that it would still be cold by the time she got here to the church one morning as I was opening the bottle of water I realized that the bottles were consistently already open I wasn't the first person opening the bottle it turns out what was really going on was I was drinking water from an already used water bottle that had been refilled cap put back on and then Frozen now maybe that's not a big deal to some of you but I got some issues with germs and I gave me the heie jeebies I mean for real there's a reason when you go to the store you buy a bottle of water that is sealed right so you're the one unsealing it and now I've been drinking water iced cold water from a bottle that somebody else had already dranking out of so there I am on that Sunday morning when I figure this out I was glitching out over the germs and in that moment the Holy Spirit helps me to see something that that was a gift it was a gift just like the Widow giving those two small coins this was a lady that did not have anything she was giving what she had she was giving from her heart she was giving from what her capacity was and the truth is it may have been the best gift given every Sunday morning because it was beautiful to God so germs and all I drank that water week after week until eventually she she passed away and I am better for it I am better for it today on the way in you received a faith promise card big black card if you didn't receive one you can get one on the way out and this is the way that you can communicate with the church what it is that you would like to contribute to the El Centro project we will not just so you know we ask for name and information not because we're going to like send out collection agents or anything like that that's not what this is this is just so we know what real okay so that it's a real so if you put like down $750,000 we'd want to make sure that we thought that was a real uh donation so on the way back out there's a like a Home Depot bucket it says El Centro on it and that's for you to put the cards in on your way out to our online friends and family and to everybody else you can also give through the church Center app to the category called El Centro now here's the ask I'm going to ask you to Simply think about and pray about what can you give on a regular basis to this project every dollar literally every cent counts in the early days we will use the extra giving to pay down the principal on the mortgage and thus leveraging even the smallest of gifts into significant impact over the Long Haul by praying the principal today it literally saves us hundreds of thousands and multiple years off the loan so regular giving helps a ton no matter how small or how big one time gifts also help like supercharge the process from the beginning so as a family this is the kind of thing where you sit around over the dinner table or have a discussion in the car and you begin to pray about what is it that what we would like to do and maybe you go have a bake sale or maybe you like like sell that Xbox online or you know what I don't know what it is but but you you figure out like what it is that you're going to do like kind of as a one-time shot in the arm idea uh my wife and I are giving monthly to this project and I also believe that God has asked us asked me to give it's hard to say that loud asked me to give my motorcycle to this project amen so not for you to ride not for you to ride okay this is not like a a tool of the Centro this is for to for the church to sell to use for the project so that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about so I don't I don't I'm not saying that for I appreciate the Applause but that's not why I said that to the project is again not for a ride but to make to make the difference when I when I Was preparing and a while back when I felt like God asked me to do this at first I was like Lord is that you he's like who else would it be who who else would it be give the bike so when I say what would the Lord have you to do as the worship team comes up when I say what would the Lord have you to do that's part of what I mean what would the Lord have you to do for this project the worship team is going to close today and when we wrap up you have a couple ways to respond you can take the card you can fill it out you can put it in the Home Depot bucket on the way out uh if you're not ready to decide today that's fine take the card home with you and and pray about it but this is our way to make a long-term generational impact that's what we're trying to do am why don't you stand with me as we close so kind of participation in giving is one way that you can respond today but another and I don't want to miss the earlier part here the deception the lying dealing with kind of secret stuff is inside of here too every Sunday these all are open if you want to talk to God about something today whether it's the giving or the dealing with some some heart issues please do so the altars are open the worship team can take it from here", "[Applause] all right good morning everybody it's a great day to be with you thank you to our for joining us online and at our very location as well just let me pause for a minute if you're joining us online today would you do us a favor and let us know that you're joining us online we know that there are many dozens of you over a hundred of you that are joining us online we just don't know exactly who you are even though you know who we are and so please introduce yourself in the comments we'd love to meet you as we look at that this week go back to 1996 1996 the Olympics came to the United States they went to Atlanta Georgia and I took a team of about a hundred people down to the Olympics that year I was playing Intent no I wasn't I was not in the Olympics yeah so we uh we were down there doing some service and we were helping and we were involved in uh facilitating some spiritually oriented conversations about Jesus because it was an interesting moment because the entire world goes to the Olympics so you have people from all over the world that come to watch uh their athletes and so you get to have some great conversations and so that's what we were down there doing having these we're passing out Maps helping people get figure out where to go and we would engage in some spiritual conversations during uh those that week at the same time there was this group called ACOG ACOG it stood for the Atlantic committee for the organization of the games these were this was the organization that was tasked with making the event happen making sure that the city of Atlanta was ready that the area was ready for these Olympic Games and they did not particularly find it appealing that we were doing what we were doing they didn't like what we were doing mostly because we had not asked them for their permission and if you didn't know this in the United States you don't have to ask for permission to talk to people that's not a thing so what they did was they established a free speech Zone this is also called the United States a free speech Zone they established a free speech Zone with a four foot by four foot section with a sign that said free speech Zone with an arrow pointing right into it this is a true story true story happened to us and so we made it our intent never to step inside of the Free Speech zone so we just never did that oh so they didn't know what to do with us and we weren't harming anything it was actually quite fun and and harmless but we again I had a team of 100 people and I know then there was a group of them that would start to approach the people that were doing these service things and conversations and they began to be detained the Atlantic committee for the organization of the games the ACOG people started to detain people on my team and they would take them to this makeshift Detention Center that they had created and they would put them in there even though they were not legally allowed to do this they just did it anyhow it was an entirely illegal detention I did not find out about this originally it took a while everybody was supposed to meet me back at a certain location and half the team wasn't there or 40 50 people in this Detention Center which I find out so I go down and I find out what's happening I said did you guys steal something did you break something I I was very confused about what they had done and turns out they hadn't done anything except what we had told them to do and I said okay let's go and I'm like but we're being detained I'm like they're not allowed to detain you let's go they're like but we're being detained and I would say let's go and then the ACOG people would say you're not allowed to go and I'd say you get to go and they'd say you're not allowed to go and I'd say you come with me right now okay this back and forth thing and so I walked into the detention center and walked out to show them that they were not they did not have to be there some of the people thought they had to stay that they had done something illegal or wrong and that it was required for them to stay in this Detention Center I had to explain to them multiple times that they needed to leave and that they needed to leave right now because we had lunch to get to the ACOG detainers would tell the people to State exactly where they were every time I would say it was time for them to leave I began to explain to my own team that these were their adversaries that they had they had no legal authority to detain them and that they were being lied to by them finally one Brave young man stood up and hesitantly left the detention area walking right past the people that said to him while he's leaving you're not allowed to leave they told them to stay use all kinds of words but they didn't touch them they only used words because that's all they were allowed to use because they were lying this is exactly by the way what Satan does today he just uses words and lies once the other 40-ish people on the team saw the first one leave it gave them a little bit of Courage and the rest of them began to leave and eventually the ACOG security just gave up and went away now anytime the rest of the Olympics throughout the rest of the Olympics that they bothered us we would call a lawyer and now you have to remember it's 1996. early cell phones I mean cell phones right like there's this Earth so you got to go like like this and it was pretty cool and so the guy that was in trouble was actually kind of intrigued that you were using a cell phone to call the lawyer and so we call the lawyer get their name and information and they would file some type of legal action against them and the Atlanta committee for the organization of the games there were so many of these things happening that there was a judge ready to handle each of these situations on the spot it was a pretty intense situation we just continue to do what we're doing and we let we it worked out fine for everybody but in life many people find themselves having become spiritually free by the power and blood of Jesus yet they find themselves somehow in detention in a Detention Center somehow they are hanging out with old chains or discouragement or anger or grief or lust or fear or worry or depression or bad habits or addictions whatever it might be they're just hanging out with all of these things however for the follower of Jesus these detentions are spiritually illegal and you are no longer required by God's law to remain in that Detention Center you are allowed to get up and walk on out somebody say walk on out all right you can walk on out that's for you you're allowed to walk on out you don't have to stay there I've been telling you for a long time get out the Detention Center so we know I want to talk to you about the heart of God for a minute we know that Jesus came to set captives free we know this look for Jesus returned to Galilee and the power of the spirit and news about him spread through the whole Countryside he taught in their synagogues and everybody praised him he went to Nazareth where he had been brought up and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue as was his custom he stood up to read The Scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him unrolling it he found the place where it is written and he reads one of our Church's favorite passages the spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he sent me to Proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor Jesus you see came to reveal the heart of the father to set us free from the things that hold us down or hold us back not to get us in trouble but to get us out of trouble you see many people many people that you will talk to have you ever invited somebody to church and they said I can't go there the place will burn down they clearly don't know who's here already right yes I'm talking about you yes yes I am talking about you but it doesn't burn down because God is not here to get you in trouble it's here to get you out of trouble John 3 16 Jesus said for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life verse 17 which is often overlooked for God did not send his son Jesus into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him to rescue that's the heart of God to rescue to rescue and in this we begin to understand his heart now here we have a scene for centuries people had been trying to earn the favor and blessing of God by following a very specific set of rules and regulations called the law this law was literally impossible to follow you couldn't do it it was not humanly possible to keep all of the laws and the people have been trying to but they can't and because they can't they try harder or they just give up altogether either way it creates all kinds of struggling and so God sends Jesus to make things right and that's the heart of the father because the heart of God watch this is always fighting for your freedom always fighting for your freedom even when you don't want him to be fighting for your freedom he's still fighting for your freedom even back when Israel was enslaved in Egypt in Exodus 3 it says this the Lord said I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers I am concerned about their suffering so I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land into a good and spacious land and now the Cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them so now go I am sending you to pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt now watch what happened God saw them in their captivity God heard them in their captivity God was concerned for them in their captivity and he says I'm going to rescue them and give them an opportunity to be free and that's exactly what he did now listen friends this is not just about Israel in Egypt wherever you are at today whatever you are going through right this second God sees you God has heard your cry and he is concerned for you and he has already been at work fighting on your behalf God is fighting for you so get on board with God and start fighting with him not against him he is for you we believe that it is God's will for you to live in Freedom God's will for you to live in Freedom thank you how do I know it's God's will for you to live in Freedom isn't it kind of arrogant for me to say what God's will is well he reveals that this is his will John 8 32 then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free Jesus also said if the son set you free you will be free indeed Jesus said earlier in verse 17 God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him because Jesus came on a rescue mission for everybody to be free and it would make absolutely no sense for Jesus to come on a rescue mission to set people free and then not want it to happen God wants us to be free second Corinthians 3 now the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom Galatians 5 1 it is for Freedom that Christ has set us free here's the idea Jesus comes he unlocks the prison when you choose to follow Jesus he takes off your shackles he will even open up the door to your prison but he will also let you stay there if you want to you don't have to leave you can hang out with ACOG all day long even though you don't have to but it is without exception what is without exception is that God's will is that you get out of captivity that you walk on out of detention that you no longer allow yourself to be detained illegally spiritually illegally and some people have just stopped believing this even though the Bible clearly states that some things are prisons that must be freely walked away from they have learned to like the prison of their life that they live in and they would just prefer that instead that's a dangerous place to be now there's also a purpose in the process of your freedom see Freedom there's a process to it voluntarily of your own free will walking out of your Detention Center in the face of those that are lying to you in the face of those that are detaining you brings to your life a certain level of faith of confidence of maturity in preparation for the next levels in your life and your future so that process is important that's why it's important that we have to that we need to take those steps sometimes in our life God works instantly for example when you humble yourself and submit to God acknowledge your sin and ask him to forgive you of your sins he does it instantly you don't have to work for it you don't have to earn it it's a gift and you get it just like that you're instantly free from bondage and sin and death but most other parts of your spiritual journey and freeing the journey towards freedom is not instantaneous most of it is a process a journey that involves a number of steps that's why we did it 12 steps to Freedom series recently there are steps there is a process if you think about Moses one of the spiritual leaders of Israel took them out of Egypt that took it took some time God had to work in Moses Moses went to Pharaoh told Pharaoh he had to let the people go Pharaoh said no there was a bunch of plagues involved ten plagues eventually they are able to walk out of Egypt it took some time that freedom took some time and then you found out in our Exodus series that it was one thing to get out of Egypt it was another thing to get to Egypt out of Israel that also took some time then there was Joshua who was Leading the People into the promised land but it didn't happen like that it took some time eventually he gets the land he had to defeat over 30 Kings to get it back there was a process involved the righteous Christian Life is not instantaneous it takes a minute actually takes a lot of minutes much like if you want an apple and you're gonna like grow the Apple first you have to plant a seed or a Seedling and you have to wait for that sea seedling to grow into a tree an apple tree and then you waste more and then you wait some more and you waste some more to get a good apple and then you have to prune the tree and then you have to prepare the tree by chasing away all the squirrels that come into your backyard and eat your apples off your Apple Tree I'm a little this is happening to me every year right now okay I still have not had a single good apple because the squirrels get them first It Takes a Minute it takes some time to work it out if there's a pregnant mom and she's so excited to have her baby no matter how excited she is she's still got to wait the nine months you got to wait the nine months you've got to go through the process to have a healthy baby they say that a habit it takes 21 days to establish a new habit I'm not sure that's true but somebody said it I think it takes longer or how about the caterpillar look those caterpillars right and some caterpillars they become butterflies in fact some caterpillars are destined to become butterflies that's their Destiny I wonder if they know I wonder if they think about it you see for some of those caterpillars they're going to become butterflies it's God's will that they become a butterfly and even though it's God's will and even though they are destined to become a butterfly if there's a young caterpillar out there that just impatient and he just wants to be a butterfly right now he cannot just get up on his branch and stand up and say I Believe I Can Fly I believe he can believe all he wants but if he jumps off of that Branch he's dying that caterpillar can think about flying every night and every day come on come on somebody he can believe it with all his heart that he can fly but until come with me until he comes through the Cocoon until he goes through the darkness until he goes through the struggle there can be no butterfly because there is purpose in the process there is purpose in the process now I wish that God would remove the middle stuff the stinky stuff the stuff that's hard but that process that process is what makes that butterfly able to be a butterfly because God is more interested in your character than in your comfort if you find a caterpillar and he has managed to get to cocoon stage in his life he's probably going through a difficult season in that cocoon but if you take that cocoon and you open it up you destroy what God is trying to do he will not become butterfly you will break open a cocoon you destroy the future of that butterfly so remember this Freedom involves a process and a partnership between God and us there's two mistakes that people generally make mistake number one is this okay God get to work I need to be free let me know when it's done yeah it's all you got mistake number two is I got this I can take care of it that's most of our mistakes right there I got it and you keep God out of it what we're supposed to do is have a partnership with God Philippians chapter two therefore my dear friends as you have always obeyed not only in my presence but now much more in my absence continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who works in you to Will and to act according to his good purpose so you have both you're working it out and God is working it out yeah both we're supposed to be in a partnership with God on that so what do we do there's four things that I want you to think about making a movement on in your life first off is this walk on out from denial to confession move from denial to confession acknowledging and confessing our lack of movement in a particular area is the first step towards the Breakthrough and we need to move out of that denial space and into reality or confession space because it is good for the soul and it places us humbly before a merciful god if you want to experience the grace and mercy of God it involves submission and confession If you deny that you are in a Detention Center If you deny that ACOG is holding you you just won't walk out in most of the 12-step programs there is a fundamental beginning stage which is admission or confession it's admitting it putting it all out there if you have an anger problem and you never admit it you will never be free you just won't from denial to confession now the next movement that we can make would be to walk on out from excuses to responsibility from excuses to responsibility don't get quiet on me now this is the good stuff right here from excuses to respond I got 76 pages of notes just on this point alone right there yeah from excuses to responsibility you see we have a natural tendency to want to blame other people to blame other people for the issues in our lives now while it is true that other people and circumstances beyond our control do have influence on our lives still we are personally responsible for the decisions that we make in what we do in response to what life brings our way so we must learn to grow and mature to put away childish things like blaming others although people do influences influence the prisons that we end up in if you stay there if you live in the land of excuses you will never fulfill any of your real life purposes and maybe it's true that other people have contributed to the stuff you go through but right now we're talking about what will I do what will I do and some of your struggles might not even be your fault but you could never get away from the reality that they're still your problem notice that Jesus never said follow me unless he never said follow me unless he never said obey me unless it's hard he didn't make any excuse Clauses for anyone because Jesus requires every person no matter who you are where you've come from anybody that wants to follow he requires the same thing the same willingness to lay down everything in order to follow him including our Brokenness including our struggles including our problems including the things we're embarrassed about including it all just lay it down and walk on out the third movement would be to walk on out from Independence to community or interdependence we live in a self-help world today we have for quite a while where everybody just wants to help themselves but the truth is that we need help from other people to have the courage and ability that we need to change that's why God wants us to be in community so that people around us can provide support honest feedback encouragement counsel and accountability that we need to truly change most people don't find authentic freedom outside the context of a true community so that's why we must do this in community not just by ourselves James chapter 5 says this confess your fault to one another it's hard to do that without another you need one another now if I took the microphone today and had everybody stand up and we said hey we're going to have a confession morning everybody's just going to confess everything I'm just going to get it out we're just going to knock this out we're just gonna be done we're gonna be done with all this and stuff here we go let's go all the three of you would be out the door right then like bathroom break time the doors are unlocked people running out okay now there would be like three or four of you they're like I've been waiting for this okay some of you are too excited to confess all right it would be a difficult moment because our protection instincts say don't tell anybody don't tell anybody you have faults just work on them by yourself and you'll fix it nobody will ever know but instead we're supposed to move from Independence to community as the worship team comes up the fourth one would be walk on out from complacency to desperation from complacency to desperation we have to ask ourselves whether we really want whether we really want it do you really want to walk out of detention if you're being kind of illegally held in that Detention Center do you want out or not and so you have to decide do I want to just be complacent where I'm at or am I desperate for more of God and what God wants in my life sometimes we can find comfort and security in the things that hold us captive and over the years the Detention Center can kind of become like home to us it's just what we've been doing for a long time we got used to it it's normative now the following Jesus can require a lot of change and adjustment in our lives and not everybody is willing to pay the price for that not everybody will it's a narrow gate to follow Jesus a narrow path to follow Jesus everybody a lot of people want the love of Jesus but not everybody wants the Narrow Path so the real question is do you want to follow do you want to follow Jesus are you desperate are you desperate to see it to see it years ago there was a blind man that was calling out to Jesus Jesus asked him what he wanted Jesus said what do you want me to do for you and the man did not say I need a new pair of shoes he did not say I need a blanket he did not say I need a new house he said I want to see I want to see he had been blind for a long time and he was sick of being blind he wanted to see he was desperate to see and that's what Jesus did for him Jesus healed the man and gave him a sight some of us find ourselves kind of in this illegal detention center of our spiritual lives we are being held by people that have no Authority or forces to have no authority to hold us they're just words and lies so the question is are you desperate to get out of that detention because if you are time to walk on out just walk on out a couple of years ago before the pandemic pastor friend of mine was on vacation came to visit our church on a Sunday morning later on that afternoon he got a hold of me and said Kurt I've never been in a church where people were so desperate for God and he meant that positively like everybody knows they need Jesus and I think that's still true today I think there is a sense amongst us without Jesus we don't have a chance [Music] we don't have a chance without Jesus I can't possibly be free and I just want to remind you today that Jesus wants you to be free all the way all the way free and you don't have to hang out in those detention centers anymore would you stand with me as we close today [Music] the worship team will close us with this song and as they do [Music] why don't you posture your heart today towards God go ahead and in your from your own heart and in your own words just begin to talk to God today let them know where you're at and would you let him help you walk on out of whatever situation that you no longer need to be facing today the altars are open let's spend some time in prayer today let's go ahead and do this together [Music]", "2023*\nCALENDAR OF EVENTS\n*D A TE S +  D E TA ILS SU B JE C T TO  C H A N G E\nAges 5-G rade

"[Music] in a broken and chaotic world there is one truth that remains the truth that love is stronger as the world begins to re-emerge after two years of confusion in whatever state you may find yourself in please join us at east coast international church to discover and embrace this love [Music] good morning everybody hey it's great to be with you today for those of you that are still in bed watching online it's good not to see you i guess but it's good good for you yeah so um also uh welcome to our revere location as well thank you for joining us today so we've just come through this great easter season um and we're really wrapping that up today we've gone through this moment where there's this easter climax where jesus has entered the city to great celebrations then his arrest his trial his crucifixion his burial and then his resurrection from the grave so what's next is there like a sequel or something that we need to be paying attention to so here's what's next after jesus rose from the grave he spent 40 days on earth appearing and teaching his followers and giving them instruction and as he's appearing and giving his followers instruction it's important that we recognize that many of these instructions are for us today here's here's one of the accounts mark chapter 16 verse 8 there were women that had gone to the tomb jesus has risen from the dead he's not there anymore the women fled from the empty tomb trembling and bewildered and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened then they briefly reported all this to peter and his companions afterward jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life amen huh i want you to catch this jesus instruction involved them being sent to the rest of the world with the unfailing message of salvation continuing mark 16 verses 14 starting in 14. still later as the 11 were eating supper he meaning jesus appeared and took them to task he took them the task don't you love it when jesus takes you to task that means you got in trouble okay took them to task most severely for their stubborn unbelief refusing to believe this is people closest to jesus so after he is resurrected they're having a hard time believing that he's really alive refusing to believe those who had seen him raised up then he said go into the world go everywhere and announce the message of god's good news to one and all whoever believes and is baptized is saved whoever refuses to believe is damned somebody say damned some of you have said a lot worse than that in church but the um we're going to get back to that later the writer another writer luke says after about the resurrection after the resurrection about jesus in acts chapter 1 verse 4 he says once when jesus was eating with them he commanded them do not leave jerusalem until the father sends you the gift he promised as i told you before john baptized with water but in just a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit so when the apostles were with jesus they kept asking him lord has the time come for you to free israel and restore our kingdom he replied the father alone has the authority to set those dates and times and they are not for you to know but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses now this is the kind of the definition of witness here the witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea and samaria into the ends of the earth after saying this he was taken up in a cloud while they were watching and they could no longer see him this is the ascension of jesus as they strained to see him rising into the heaven two white robed men probably angels suddenly stood among them men of galilee they said why are you standing here staring into heaven jesus has been taken from you into heaven but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go subtext here stop looking at the heavens and do what he told you to do mark 16 he jesus had appeared it took them the task for their severely for their stubborn unbelief isn't it interesting how people still have a challenge of belief today sometimes stubbornly so like just are stubborn in our unbelief we have multiple accounts of jesus appearing to people over this next 40 days over these 40 days he was doing a lot of things he was building the faith of the faithless he was restoring hope to those that had been give had lost some hope and he was helping the skeptics to get their head and heart around the whole thing i want you to hear that today just because somebody is a skeptic doesn't mean they're a lost cause and if you have issues with doubt and skepticism it's okay jesus wants to help you with that john chapter 20 it says one of the twelve disciples thomas who we call doubting thomas the video we watched earlier was not with the others when jesus came they told him we have seen the lord but he replied i won't believe it unless i see the nail wounds in his hands put my fingers into them and place my hand into the wound on his side okay fine eight days later the disciples were together again and this time thomas was with them the doors were locked but suddenly as before jesus was standing among them peace be with you he said and his gaze goes towards thomas and he said to thomas put your finger here and look at my hands put your hand in the wound in my side don't be faithless any longer believe isn't that great don't be faithless any longer believe these are words from jesus and maybe you wrestle with this just listen to jesus don't be faithless any longer believe my lord and my god thomas exclaimed then jesus told him you believe because you have sent me you have seen me blessed are those who believe without seeing me many years ago i was having lunch with a young adult in the church was having a really hard time with belief really skeptical doubted a lot we're just having lunch and he says to me i i just wish jesus would do something for me i said oh okay like like what he was like you're like come to earth so that's great it's great you mean like you wanted to come to earth and do miracles he said that would be awesome like said you want to become a miracle like like maybe raise somebody from the dead you're like what you said that would be amazing then it would be impossible not to believe he already did all this you want to do it again yeah i do that conversation didn't go quite the way i thought it was going to go yeah i wanted to do it again you know belief comes hard for people and sometimes people are skeptical and i think we can understand why well in this in this account jesus is going back and he goes to thomas because thomas is having a hard time believing and what jesus is doing is getting the team back together because he's got work for the team to do and so he's pulling the team the core back together in order to accomplish the greatest work that the world would ever know so jesus is intentionally doing these things he intentionally then goes to peter the disciple who had denied jesus three times the very disciple of jesus who had turned his back on jesus that may be one of the most emotionally complicated times in jesus's life and here jesus is reaching back out to peter the account we're about to read he reaches back out to peter to let peter know that he's restoring him back to himself now before we get to that if you will recall perhaps you don't when jesus first called peter he did so uh near the beginning of jesus's ministry he called peter there was this moment where peter was in a fishing boat and they had been fishing all night and they hadn't caught any fish and jesus says to peter why don't you go out and throw the net out again and peter reluctantly does so and he catches so many fish that his boat's sinking another boat has to come and fill up so this is the peter gets back to shore and he begins to follow jesus from that day forward and it was this really pivotal moment in peter and the disciples lives where they recognize that god is jesus is calling them to be fishers of men and they choose to follow and they spend three years with jesus seeing all the miracles and all the wonders and listening to all the teaching and peter at this critical moment denies jesus it was a very problematic moment for peter in john chapter 21 after the resurrection it says later jesus appeared again to his disciples beside the sea of galilee this is how it happened several of the disciples were there simon peter thomas nathanael from canaan galilee the sons of zebedee and two other disciples simon peter said i'm going fishing we'll come too they all said so they went out in a boat and they caught nothing all night huh interesting at dawn jesus was standing on the beach but the disciples couldn't see who he was he called out fellows have you caught any fish no they replied and then kind of like an echo he says throw out your net on the right hand side of the boat and you'll get some where have they heard this before so they did and they couldn't haul in the net because there were so many fish in it then the disciple jesus loved said to peter it's the lord when simon peter heard it was the lord he put on his tunic for he had stripped for work jumped into the water and headed to the shore he knew it was jesus he also knew that he had some apologies to make probably the others stayed at the boat and pulled the loaded net to the shore for they were only about a hundred yards from sure when they got there they found breakfast waiting for them fishing fish cooking over a charcoal fire and some bread jesus made breakfast for them it's amazing bring some of the fish you had just caught jesus said so simon peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore there were 153 large fish and yet the net hadn't torn now come and have some breakfast jesus said none of the disciples dared to ask him who are you they knew it was the lord then jesus served them bread and fish this was the third time since jesus appeared had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead after breakfast jesus asks simon peter now this is jesus singling peter out much like he did with thomas he's singling peter out simon son of john do you love me more than these yes lord peter replied you know i love you then feed my lambs jesus told him jesus repeated the question simon son of john do do you love me yes lord peter said you know i love you then take care of my sheep jesus said and a third time he asked him just think how many times did peter deny jesus three times jesus here asked simon a third time simon son of john do you love me peter was hurt that jesus asked the question a third time he said lord you know everything you know that i love you jesus said then feed my sheep what's happening here is jesus is helping peter peter had denied jesus three times now jesus is breaking the back of that failure by having peter now embrace him three times while at the same time calling peter to be one of the greatest leaders of the early way of jesus that we know of he was doing this in front of the other disciples so the other disciples would know that jesus was restoring peter all the way back and so that peter would know that he was restored to jesus as well so jesus following the resurrection what was he doing he was appearing to his followers jesus appeared but he also empowered in acts 1 4 it says do not leave jerusalem until the father sends you the gift he promised as i told you before john baptized with water but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you jesus only has 40 days remaining or 40 days remaining after the resurrection amongst his followers and he's getting as much done as he can he's appearing he's instructing he's clarifying but the one thing jesus is not going to do is jesus is not going to abandon them instead he is going to give them the gift of the holy spirit as in the father son and holy spirit so the mission that jesus is getting ready to release them to do they will not be doing on their own but rather he is going with them god will give the holy spirit to all of his followers from that day forward so from that day forward everyone who calls upon the name of jesus the holy spirit is now with them we are the as followers of jesus we are the temples of the holy spirit so what this does is it mobilizes the way of jesus from one person jesus to all of his followers who will now have his spirit his authority and his mission not just the 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 of his closest followers but all of them all of them means us today you see satan thought that it killed the man but instead the death and resurrection of jesus was the catalytic moment to create a global movement a global movement to bring good news to the poor to heal the broken to set captives free and for his justice for the oppressed which is what east coast international church is part of today this is a direct straight line from this passage we are empowered by jesus to be part of his mission so jesus appeared jesus empowered but jesus also directed in verse 8 it says and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea and samaria to the ends of the earth so jesus makes sure that they're empowered and in case you had forgotten anytime we are given something by god it's for a purpose we are given the power for a purpose just like all of these good gifts from god we're not supposed to hoard them we don't just have like a collection of gifts from god that we just put on a shelf and take a look at it every once in a while it's not a collection that you sell on ebay either i thought that was funny the uh so if you have gifts if you have gifts that god has given you if you have talents that god has given you if you have skill sets that god has given you and you are not using them the way that god wants you to use them or if you have managed to put those gifts and talents on a shelf for the past two years it's time for you to take them off the shelf and put them back to work in your life because god has given them to you for a purpose so the specific instruction of jesus is to be a witness a witness of what a witness of jesus of telling people what we have seen of jesus what we have heard from jesus what he what we've experienced with jesus they were doing it then and we get to do it today telling people about jesus the good news of jesus everywhere everywhere in mark chapter 16 jesus said go into the world go everywhere announce the message of god's good news to one and all whoever believes and is baptized to save whoever refuses to believe is damned that means hell friends got really quiet in the first service on this section of the sermon there is a prevailing sense in our culture and i want you to pay really close attention to this because you can miss it there's a prevailing sense in people's thinking that if i do certain bad things then i will go to hell and if i do certain good things then i will go to heaven or if i have seven bad things and six good things then i'm not gonna make it in and if i do eight good things instead of six bad things then then there'll be like this cosmic scale somehow this is some kind of weird mythology okay this is not bible that's not what the bible teaches at all it's not a biblical worldview the scriptures let us know this we are all born into ruin we start off at we start off into a polluted and corrupted world carrying upon us the weight of generations of sin we are born into a natural state of damnation it's not that we're going to be damned it's we are damned so when people ask me which this is like one of the top 10 questions people ask me will i go to hell if i do this thing or that thing i'll be like no you're not going to hell because you're of that you're going to hell because you're a sinner whose heart is desperately wicked and you were born that way that's my favorite conversation it really is and if you want out of that i can help you this is why it was necessary a little panic on the first row here this is why it's necessary for jesus to come and live a perfect and sinless life to sacrifice his life for the sins of humanity to resurrect from the grave defeating death and offering freedom to all those in captivity you see he offers freedom to us all we are those are we're born into that captivity literally born into spiritual captivity and that is why it is so critically important to get into the mission of jesus if you have not accepted the offer of jesus to get out of your captivity then first receive that offer ask him to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life that's the offer we just we just live in a place of damnation and jesus offers to rescue us and bring us to a place of freedom so we need to be rescued but then we also need to rescue others we need to be snatched from the flames but we also need to help others be snatched from the flames and if we choose this we get to be part of the greatest rescue mission in history ii peter chapter 3 verse 9 says the lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance that's the heart of god he doesn't want us to live and stay in damnation he wants to rescue us that's one of the reasons why we say everybody is welcome at east coast international church and by everybody we mean everybody here's why we say it because god himself wants everybody to come to repentance everybody we do that though by being the very kindness of god and so whatever it takes whatever it takes would you consider making it hard for people to stay in hell would you would you just do your part to make it hard for people to stay in hell make it hard for your spouse and your child and your parents and your friends and your boss and your neighbor or your enemies make it hard for them to stay in hell make it hard for them to choose evil not not necessarily because you're trying to legislate it or campaign against it but because you are the very evidence of the love of jesus and his power to live an abundant and generous life make it hard do whatever it takes to make it hard for evil to deceive people into thinking they're just okay and it's all going to work out in the end make it hard by living the truth with your life and creating alternatives for righteous living not because of what you hate but because of what you love because of who you love whatever it takes that's the mission first corinthians 9 the apostle paul says this this is like somebody who's on mission and he's living out the mission explaining what it looks like even though i am a free man with no master i become a slave to all people to bring many to christ when i was with the jews i lived like a jew to bring the jews to christ when i was with those who follow the jewish law i too lived under the law even though i am not subject to the law i did this so i could bring to christ those who are under the law when i am with gentiles who do not follow the jewish law i too live apart from that law so i can bring them to christ but i do not ignore the law of god i obey the law of christ for i am with those who are weak i share when i am with those who are weak i share their weakness for i want to bring the weak to christ yes i try to find common ground with everyone doing everything i can to save some everything i can i do everything to spread the good news and share in its blessings so what's the mission you know easter is great but that was the setup for the mission the mission that jesus sends us on do everything you can to make sure that people don't have to stay in damnation here's my great concern most people in our area have not accurately heard the good news of jesus christ in a way that they can actually understand part of that is because they haven't known somebody that is authentically on the mission of jesus to become or be more like the love and kindness of god so my challenge is the worship team comes up my challenge for us today is this do whatever it takes to fulfill that purpose in your life the mission of jesus fulfill the mission of jesus allow yourself to be creative to give yourself opportunity to share what jesus has done in your life whatever it takes rescue one whatever it takes make it hard for people to stay in hell just stand with me as we close today [Music] [Music] easter is about the resurrection the resurrection's about us getting on mission getting on mission mission helping those who are living in damnation to have a new and abundant life [Music] so today [Music] what is your role do whatever it takes do whatever it takes to rescue one do whatever it takes to be the kindness of god do whatever it takes to get on the mission of jesus and friends listen if you are here today and you're realizing oh if you're having like that matrix moment where you've always believed one set of things then you're finding out something is different is true [Music] i want you to recognize that jesus offers you his forgiveness jesus offers you his leadership he offers to rescue all we have to do is respond and accept the forgiveness and leadership of jesus and it's simple it's simple to say [Music] you just ask jesus to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life then you join jesus on his mission to rescue so wherever you're at on this journey today the worship team is going to lead us and we're going to sing [Music] the altars are open but i want you to recognize that you have a role to play in the mission of jesus very important role to play doing whatever it takes maybe today you need to pray for somebody that's far from god [Music] who's in a real difficult situation [Music] maybe somebody you know spilled with unbelief or skepticism and faith comes hard to them [Music] maybe there's somebody you know that's been harmed by people [Music] that should have loved them and it has just become overwhelmingly difficult to consider that god might love them [Music] maybe you know somebody who has experienced hurt at the hands of somebody in spiritual leadership and has derailed them [Music] whatever it takes whatever it takes let's help people not live in damnation but live in the abundant life jesus so freely offers whatever it takes [Music]", "welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting this is the prayer podcast and i'm pastor dave it's my privilege to join you today for a time of prayer and i want to try something a little bit different today our topic is reading of the scriptures reading of the scriptures first timothy 4 13 the apostle paul tells timothy until i get there focus on reading the scriptures to the church reading the scriptures as we are praying and seeking god it is important for us to remember that as much as god wants to hear from us we want to hear from him and one of the clearest ways god speaks to us is through the scriptures which is why meditating on the scriptures when we pray is so transformative it's different than reading your typical book or audio book or listening to a like a really good motivational book it's different how is it different well hebrews 4 12 tells us that the word of god is different because it is alive and powerful god wants to do a work in us through his word his word reveals his character and that can be life changing and so very simply i just want to do this with you today so what i'm going to do is i'm going to read this passage of scripture mark chapter 5 verses 21 through 43 and what i'm going to do is i'm going to read it to you and then afterwards we're going to ask some questions to kind of wrestle with the text that we just heard okay so this is again mark 5 21-43 jesus got into a boat again and went back to the other side of the lake where a large crowd gathered around him on the shore then a leader of the local synagogue whose name was jairus arrived when he saw jesus he fell at his feet pleading fervently with him my little daughter is dying he said please come and lay your hands on her heal her so she can live jesus went with him and all the people followed crowding around him a woman in the crowd had suffered for 12 years with constant bleeding she had suffered a great deal for many doctors and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them but she had gotten no better in fact she had gotten worse she had heard about jesus so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his rope for she thought to herself if i can just touch his robe i will be healed immediately the bleeding stopped and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition jesus realized that once that healing power had gone out from him so he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my robe his disciples said to him look at this crowd pressing around you how can you ask who touched me but he kept on looking around to see who had done it then the frightened woman trembling at the realization of what had happened to her came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace your suffering is over while he was still speaking to her messengers arrived from the home of jairus the leader of the synagogue they told him your daughter is dead there's no use troubling the teacher now but jesus overheard them and said to jairus don't be afraid just have faith then jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn't let anyone go with him except peter james and john the brother of james when they came to the house of the synagogue leader jesus saw much commotion in weeping and wailing he went inside and asked why all this commotion and weeping the child isn't dead she's only asleep the crowd laughed at him but he made them all leave and he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying holding her hand he said to her talithakum which means little girl get up and the girl who was 12 years old immediately stood up and walked around they were overwhelmed and totally amazed jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened and then he told him to give her something to eat okay that is our story at this time i would encourage you to try something if you can go back and listen to the story a couple more times and take a moment and as you're listening put yourself in that story and here are some questions that might be helpful for you to ask yourself what is one word or phrase that stood out to you as you heard that story question is which character did you connect with the most why do you think that is another question is what do you notice about jesus responses in this story what do they say about his character and how he responds to certain situations lastly i would ask that whatever you begin to think about whatever you sense god speaking to you jot it down in a notebook or somewhere where you can take notes don't worry if it's accurate or not take a moment and wrestle with the story and let the word of god speak to you and if prompted respond you may feel prompted to step out in faith make it actionable maybe god is asking you to do something maybe you will feel prompted to share what you're hearing from god with someone you trust someone on staff your small group leader someone in your small group whatever it is let's take a few moments now and let the word of god speak to us thank you for your time we'll see you tomorrow bye", "[Applause] all right all right good morning everybody all right hey great to see you today thank you I woke up on this Father's Day and I said to myself I really want to dress and look like a Father's Day picnic table cover so so that's exactly what I did that's exactly what I did today so I want to give you a heads up on something uh I mentioned it a couple of times a little more in detail today I'll tell you this will be my last day preaching for a few weeks because my wife and I are going away on a mini sabbatical for six weeks at the end of this because I'm not sure how to take that like oh he's out good look I'll be gone for six weeks at the end of this week and uh you know my wife we've been pastoring for over 30 years which seems impossible but we've never successfully taken a sabbatical which we're supposed to do every seven years and over the next six weeks the Pastoral staff and board are available for you as you need uh we have things planned out for the rest of the summer uh and the next series we have a Heroes series that begins next week starting with Abraham uh this is going to align for next month with our Bible engagement goal of Genesis now the Pastoral staff as many of you are familiar with when they preach they bring the fire every single time [Applause] we are we are super fortunate that every one of our pastoral staff are excellent preachers and so that's going to go great here on Sundays and the worship team everybody everything's just regular I'll just not be here and so my emails and calls um and I I got to give you some things so you don't make certain mistakes so every Monday of my life begins with this text message Pastor Kurt I know it's your day off but from the moment texting was invented that has been my life every Monday morning I know it's I know it's your day our pastor but the uh and so uh you literally won't be able to get a hold of us during this time I'm just so my emails and calls will be forwarded to my assistant hawana it's automatically so I actually will never see them or hear them I will not have access to my social media all of my text messages will be forwarded to my assistant as well this will all be the same rules for my my wife as well uh there's actually only two people that know how to get a hold of me uh you got burner phones going on no no burner phones but the uh it's going to be really hard so it'll be a real true emergency if need be what's going on here is my wife and I were going away to recharge we're supposed to recharge during a sabbatical and prepare for your next season of ministry which is here in Lynn it's not going to be somewhere else and we're going to go rest explore Adventure all the things that recharge us one of the things we're going to do is we're going to be visiting nine of the most critical sites in church history or the Apostle Paul and others established the first churches that we've talked about for years like Ephesus and Corinth and Philippi and so many more we've been planning this for over a year here at the church and so you are in good hands while Jen and I are away and thank you for allowing us to do this appreciate it so and because I don't have social media during this time I won't be able to like make you annoyed by all the posts on like where we're at we'll have to save some pictures for later now two and a half years following the Union's victory in Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation an entire military Corps of soldiers composed of free and formerly enslaved black men were shipped to Texas to secure the Mexican border from Napoleon's Army and prevent resurgent Confederate activity on the way stormy seas emerged some might even call it an act of God the ships were forced to pull into Galveston Bay Galveston Texas on June 18 1865 to gather supplies the next day Friday June 19th when the leader Granger arrived there were more than a thousand enslaved people working in the Galveston ports and houses and hotels and cotton fields and barber and smithing shops there's more than a thousand enslaved people would have witnessed that day over sixteen thousand black soldiers in Union Army uniforms as far as the eye could see as their liberators the leader Granger read the words the people of Texas are informed that in accordance with the proclamation of the executive of the United States all slaves are free this involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former Masters and slaves that was the that's why we celebrate uh Juneteenth and it's always interesting that it connects with Father's Day [Applause] I think it's interesting that it lines up a lot of times with Father's Day or around Father's Day because fathers if there's anything you need to teach how to be free is one of them and how to maintain Freedom as well now Imagine This if you were an enslaved person living in captivity and oppression and then someone that looks like you that has already experienced that freedom the freedom that you want to experience walks up to you and is clearly and obviously already free and they say to you your days of captivity are over that had to be a powerful moment the Juneteenth holiday that we celebrate as a nation is in part a reminder of a powerful truth that all men are supposed to be free but if we do not declare and enforce that freedom it will not be given until those that are free make it known and require it to be so [Applause] so make it known and require it to be so even in 2023 so thank God for freedom and for The Proclaimers of Freedom both then and now this is extremely important there's there are applications here both physically and spiritually that you can make very easily now before my daughter was born I received lots of calls from a group from a group within my youth group that I had been pastoring for many years and they would call me on Father's Day to wish me a happy Father's Day now initially I thought they were being silly because obviously I wasn't a dad but after a while it dawned on me that the 10 kids that had been calling me all of them had absent fathers and so before the age of 30 I had become a father without knowing it to dozens of teenagers without actually fully comprehending it now it was kind of a weird moment a proud moment a sad moment to realize just how hard of a day a day like Father's day was for so many people now for those of you today that dread this day for lack of a father or due to a super jacked up relationship with your father first off I want to say this as a man and as a father my heart aches for you and I'm sorry second I want you to know that I pray for you leading into these days and on Father's Day as if you were my actual children and as one of your spiritual fathers I am so proud of you for pursuing a full and healthy relationship with your ultimate Heavenly Father and third I want you to hear this today remember that you are never an orphan with God the psalmist says in Psalm 68 God is a father to the fatherless it means you always have the best father now this is a fantastic moment when we join there's this fantastic moment when you join God's Kingdom that you become adopted as one of God's children now throughout the scripture it's really clear not everybody is actually a child of God which is goes counter intuitive to what we hear all the time there's actually two kingdoms and there's there's Kingdom of this world and there's the kingdom of God there's children of Satan and children of God now first John chapter 3 verse 1 says this see how very much our father loves us for he calls us his children and that is what we are so when you join God's kingdom when you choose him as your father through Jesus Christ you become his child now because the world is so polluted and corrupted over thousands of years of corruption uh conflict and sin the idea of family and the idea of father can be super complicated thinking and asking questions like what is a family supposed to be what makes up a family what is a woman supposed to be what is a man supposed to be and in case you're curious there is an actual Bible answer to those questions what is a mother supposed to be what is a father supposed to be so before we go outside and enjoy some tasty bacon treats um and I have like one of the shortest messages ever here this morning um so they can go throw an ax and or you know outside um we got let me let me run through a few things quickly here I want you to know this today the God our father loves his children perfectly when a human father excels as a father he stands out and in some sense is Iconic and to be admired human fathers though do fail their children we're not all perfect none of us are perfect but some of us are less perfect than others and sometimes abandonment happens or abuse or unjust anger or neglect or other sins human fathers can fail to be perfect fathers because all humanity is ultimately sinful God however is the perfect father the father every human father should strive to be like so even if your Earthly father failed God our heavenly father never will fail Jesus said this once Jesus said your you parents if your children ask for a loaf of bread do you give them a stone instead or if they ask for a fish do you give them a snake of course not so if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly father give good gifts to those who ask him I want you to catch this God Delights in giving good things to his children he loves giving the goodies to his children don't miss that he loves to do it he loves cares for and leads his children perfectly whether we have a good or a poor father on Earth we can be assured that when we are adopted into God's family through Christ we now have the best father ever and forever this of course is not always an easy thing to accept or even understand but God loves us perfectly and he is also entirely approachable we don't have to be scared of God the Bible has two major parts the Old Testament and the New Testament the first part would have these ordinary Israelites were not allowed to enter into God's presence they couldn't actually approach God only the high priesthood he would enter the most holy part of the Tabernacle after a great amount of ceremonial cleansing and following all of these regulations but then there was a big shift when Jesus died on the cross his sacrifice made it possible for everybody that wanted to enter in to the very presence of God without the need for a human priest because Jesus became our priest we don't need a priest of any kind Jesus is our priest Believers can now approach God as a son or daughter approaches a loving father who loves and cares for his children that's how we're supposed to approach God in the book of Hebrews it says so let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God there will there we will receive this mercy and we will find Grace to help us when we need it most God's children God's children therefore can bring their cares worries frustrations Joys and laughter before the father freely and safely we don't have to approach God hesitantly or or or with anxiety but with full boldness because he welcomes it now that sounds good but the reality is if you have never understood pure love than a Godly love which is the purest of all can be difficult to grasp what is even the meaning of love sometimes because of this we reject the protective enduring and faithful love of God in our life not understanding what it is because you've never even encountered love before and it can sound too good to be true and sometimes it's so too good to be true that it even seems scary to trust because you've simply been hurt too many times now sometimes we will then attempt to hide from God In Fear when the whole time God simply wants us to confidently approach him so if you ever find yourself begging God for stuff you don't have to beg God for anything you don't need to hide your face from God you don't need to cover yourself from God you just walk with God talk with God live life with God because God is entirely approachable thank you so and lastly here God our father gives his children a good inheritance now in ancient times Sons would receive an inheritance from their father in ancient ancient times but daughters would get nothing right you know when I was like 11 I used to remind my sisters of that you know so so um boo but when Jesus came Jesus did something he shook the systems of the world he he messed with all the systems because all the systems were broken all the systems were flawed all the systems were messed up hey imagine that systems being messed up Jesus came in and he shook it all and and really changed the rules or or completed the rules in Galatians chapter 3 says this there is no longer Jew or Gentile slaver free male or female for you are all one in Christ Jesus this is extremely important extremely important it speaks to us in a very real and relevant way in 2023 and I want to talk to you about this be careful of attaching identities to yourself that are in opposition to what God clearly states America is going through a spiritual crisis right now the worship team can come on up where false prophets have convinced Millions with their anti-anti Bible ideas anti-christ-like ideas around is something that I would call the identity indoctrination here's how it works every single time you complete the sentence I am and it doesn't then the next words aren't a child of God every time that happens you are subtly buying into a world view that's trying to lead you away from God's fathership in your life it started a long time ago I'm a worker I'm a cleaner I'm a helper you know what I'm a I I'm an engineer you know it started off with these kind of I AMS still missing the entire Point that's not who you are that's what you do I am a child of God this is how it's supposed to go hi my name is Kurt with a K not a c hi my name is Kurt and I am a child of God I am a child of God I am a cog if you need to abbreviate it my identity is fully completely and wholly expressed as a child of God what's that mean it means that I should never make any other identity declaration I might be wrestling with some things but I am a child of God I may have some confusions I am navigating through but I am a child of God all other identities in my life are falling away and I am being rebuilt and restored in the image of God exactly the way God wants that's why it's so important to not buy in the World Systems around identity and doctrination Galatians chapter 4. says and because we are his children God has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts prompting us to call out Abba Father now you are no longer a slave but God's Own Child and since you are his child God has made you his heir God is father provides us with an inheritance for all those who believe God the Father sent his son Jesus he sent his son Jesus to die a shameful death on a cross so that Sinners might become Sons and Daughters of God in anybody today even today anybody who trusts in Jesus for the Forgiveness of sins and invites Jesus to lead their life becomes a child of God and we become heirs with Jesus our brothers and sisters with Jesus and that gives us a family a place where we belong the scripture also says but when the right time came God sent his son born of a woman subject to the law God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law so that he could adopt us as his very own children so in that as you're considering as you're contemplating that in that moment of personal decision your identity is changed from belonging to the world to belonging to God and you become irrevocably God's child and he becomes your good good father would you stand with me as we close [Music] the worship team is going to close us with this song give you a chance to respond and reflect the altars are open and then we'll be back up with some", "[Music] in a broken and chaotic world there is one truth that remains the truth that love is stronger as the world begins to re-emerge after two years of confusion in whatever state you may find yourself in please join us at east coast international church to discover and embrace this love [Music] all right good morning everybody it's great to be with you thank you for joining us online and revere as well today we have special guests we have some world outreach partners from the country of nicaragua that are here today to share and to share what god is doing with them and i want you to just get a little bit of information here in our movement each local church partners with missionaries uh to send them across the globe to uh for the purposes of sharing the good news of jesus christ to for compassion for different projects across the planet uh particularly through the local churches in other countries as well we are supporting approximately 40 different missionaries or missionary organizations right now as a local church and so that's what that's what you do that's what you do and so whenever you give for example through the church center app if you want to give something special to missions you click on the missions option and and that's uh how we support those 40 different missionary and missionary projects our missionaries today we've been supporting for several years since they first went to the country of nicaragua which is a country close to our heart here at east coast international church for those of you that don't know we even started a church there many years ago in that country and so we have a it has a special place in our heart these two missionaries are very special to us as well or especially special to me uh

it's an honor to be here this morning um it is family um just to show the goodness of how god is using this church this morning is not about ken and kendra doubt missionaries to nicaragua it's about east coast international church and how god is using this church around the world and particularly in the country of nicaragua it's the second poorest country on this side of the globe and our family of five 15 years ago set out to be just god's vessel in his hands just to show christ love in a practical way our kids were ages two four and five when we left for the field now they're 16 19 and 20 and time goes by quickly but throughout the last 15 years ecic has always been so faithful and praying for us and supporting us and so it's just an honor this morning to be here back in person to give an update how god is using this church like i said the best way to describe what we do in nicaragua as your missionaries is more of a compassionate evangelism lots of needs fifty percent of the population lives on less than one dollar a day we have a highlight video because we do not have enough time this morning to share with you how god is using this church but as you watch this video praise god because this is a testimony of of this church how god is using ecic and bringing hope and healing to the country of nicaragua once again we are just an extension of this church and we are thankful for that extension but praise god as we watch this video [Music] [Applause] do [Music] [Music] [Applause] good morning the word of god says to speak up and declare of his marvelous acts and wonderful deeds and this morning that is my part and this service is to share about what the lord has been doing in nicaragua so that he may be glorified it was a thursday night november the 5th and we loaded up our trucks and we headed across the country because nicaragua had just been hit by two back-to-back hurricanes so you can imagine in a third world country where the infrastructure is very poor the people live in homes that are plastic sheet metal and wood and a tropical storm for us is devastating now imagine a category 5 hurricane and then another category 5 hurricane so we loaded up our trucks and we headed across the country for a two-day journey to the coast and halfway the coast at the end of our first day we landed in a community called alamecamba now alamecamba is not on the coast but it has a huge river that flows through it and when the first hurricane came it busted open the river and flooded the entire community the two-story homes were covered and the people had to find a way to get rescued because there were no emergency rescue services that particular night when we came to um we rolled into alamecamba i remember that the first truck parked at the back entrance of the local church we began to unload the trucks and get aid into the church that was being used as a shelter and that night i grabbed a box of rice that was on the back of the truck and i began to walk into the back doors of the church and as i walked into the back doors of the church my eyes quickly shifted to a man that was laying down on a thin mattress in the back corner of the church from a distance you could see that he was shaking it was wet he was coughing and i sat down that box of rice and and i quickly went back and kneeled down next to him on that mattress and i looked at him in the eyes and he had a fever he was struggling to breathe and i said are you okay and he looked at me and he said no and as he struggled to communicate he began to tell me that he was cold he was wet he'd been wet for days he was sick and then he lost absolutely everything he had and then he looked at me and the last thing he said was and i'm sad the tears rolled down his face and i was sad i took his hand and i said what's your name and he said my name is cross cross you don't have to be sad because jesus loves you so much he loves you so much that he sent us aid in advance miraculously before the hurricane hit so that we would have the aid on hand to be able to respond we have drinking water and food and warm clothes and sheets and towels and plastic and sheet metal to help you build a temporary shelter jesus loves you he hasn't abandoned you he hasn't forgotten about you he loves you i asked cross if i could pray with him and he said yes and we prayed that night we prayed that god would heal his body that he would touch christ that it would heal his body from the sickness that he had and that would cross would come to know jesus as his personal lord and savior after i got done praying cross didn't say anything and i stood up and walked away because we had to deliver aid all through the night to the other shelters in the community before continuing on the next day and as we left the church i just couldn't stop thinking about cross so as we began to unload the trucks truck after truck and all these shelters and i started to ask the locals in the community about this man what's his story and i learned that cross was a widow the cross lived alone in a two-story wooden home on stilts near the river that had busted open and that after the first hurricane he climbed out of a window and got onto his roof because he didn't have any other way to to save himself and he was there wet cold with nothing to eat for three days until a canoe came by and he got into this canoe of a neighbor somebody that was out trying to help people and in that canoe they took him through the streets of alamecamba which were now rivers until they were out completely of the river and they hit dry ground and when cross got out of the canoe he was the front doors of our assemblies of god church in alameda the church took him in and gave him shelter began to be christ's hands and feet but unfortunately they had no aid until we got there when cross went into that shelter that night he was only there for one hour before the pastor got a phone call that his home had been lifted up with a current and went floating down the river and cross lost absolutely everything finished out giving aid that night we went back to that church where cross was on that mattress in the back of the church and as i was getting out of the pickup truck to go myself back into the church because our our team was going to sleep in the church that night with all the people who were using it as a shelter before we continued our journey the next day the pastor comes out of the church and he says missionary missionary yeah pastor and he says cross is calling for you my heart just leaped with joy because i couldn't stop thinking about cross and i quickly went into the church and now i'm soaking wet from deliverance giving aid out all night long and i go into the corner of the church and i kneel down and i see cross's face with a huge smile from ear to hear and i leaned down i said cross you're happy and he said oh i'm happy he said your god healed me he took away my pain and he gave me joy he healed my body i can breathe he had no fever and he said i want to know this god who healed me that night in alamecamba had the joy and the pleasure of leading cross to the lord as his personal lord and savior today sunday if you were to go if you were to go to church in alamecamba you would go through the back doors of the church and the first person you'd see his cross because he's a servant of the lord he's been there for a year serving the lord and this morning we just want to say thank you thank you ecic for allowing us to be your hands and feet to be the lord's hands and feet to the people who so desperately need it and today there's a man named cross and alamecamba nicaragua who lost absolutely everything yet gained it all may god bless you [Applause] amen powerful testimony because of you guys because of east coast international church i can't emphasize that enough we are your missionaries from the very beginning as pastor kirk said you guys supported us and been praying for us maybe you've just been attending this church for not a long time you didn't realize that but this church loves missions god is using the east coast international church to bring hope and healing in the lynn community some of you guys are testimonies to that amen but he's also using this church worldwide and so thank you for your faithfulness and as a missionary let me let me tell you and share with you one of the key things that the lord has placed on my heart and emphasizes the last 15 years as being a full-time missionary to nicaragua is that he is always with us it's something i knew and even sing about it like the songs that we sung this morning some of the lyrics based from scripture so powerful but at times we sing and then we leave and we life happens but as a missionary i realize it is so true that he is always with us and as missionaries as your missionaries in a country that is so devastated and through from the past 12 years of the ups and downs from civil unrest to back-to-back national hurt and hurricanes other national disasters through we never envisioned how god would use us and how the ministry would evolve but we knew that god was enough when we encountered cross we knew that god was enough and that led us to when we read the scriptures found in jeremiah 29 11. there's a scripture i read a lot but i read it mainly for me as as a verse about how god was writing to israel and says i have plans for you declares the lord plans to prosper you not to harm you for a hope and a future and i always read that as a guess god is for me but i started as a as a missionary i started reading that and i realized that was written for people around the world as well the kids that grew up in the dumps if you go the capital of nicaragua at one time 2 000 kids lived in a garbage dump they called that home they were born there but god has a plan for them romans chapter 28 romans chapter 8 verse 28 says and we know that for those who love god all things work together for good for those who are called according to his purpose and i share that this morning that god has a plan for your life for the lives of the kids and adults in nicaragua and for my life have you ever stopped and wonder why you were alive for such a time as this right now sometimes in ministry in life would it be easier if moses was alive right now or apostle paul or peter you know or billy graham but they had they had their moments and god used them it's god does not make mistakes he he allowed us to be alive right now for such a time as this you sit in there me as your missionaries he wants to use us he has a plan for us even when life is hard and there's struggles up and downs he is always with us to be encouraged this morning speaking of encouragement hawaii's going to come back up and share another testimony because in revelations it says that we overcome the evil one by the blood of the lamb and jesus took care of that and by the word of our testimony so on april the 19th of 2018 our world flipped upside down everything that we own is in nicaragua our entire life is in nicaragua kids have been raised there and on this day we woke up and our country entered a time of crisis unrest and it was complicated and it was dangerous and we were faced with a really big question and that question is do we stay or do we go we just didn't know what to do but the lord led us and guided us and we stayed after we were there for a few months um amongst this this pressure and this the situation that we're living in colleagues were leaving foreigners were leaving nationals who had the ability to leave were leaving and we began to see the lord just miraculously open up doors to do other types of ministry in a time where in our country there was a lot of desperation and need and it was beautiful it was really beautiful but one day we got a phone call that we had to leave it was a mandatory evacuation we had to leave the country so we grabbed our backpacks and we got on an airplane and we left and we had absolutely no idea if we were going to be gone for a day a week a month a year if we would ever be able to go back home to nicaragua during this time it was very uncomfortable for those of you who speak spanish we learned a new word during that time which is inserted just the unknown we just didn't know anything and we just began to pray and ask god to lead us and to guide us and after we were in the states for just a couple of weeks kind of been waiting and holding waiting to see what's going to happen i had to fly back into nicaragua as my husband mentioned prior we have over 900 feeding centers in the country of nicaragua we feed over 90 000 children every single day at noon it is a big operation and we had to go back into country for a mandatory meeting in order for the organization to continue to function and so i went back under strict security guidelines and just before i got on the plane to leave somebody who knows us and loves us dearly said something that in the middle of our uncertainty in the middle of our just unknown kind of just stuck and kept spinning they wanted to encourage us and they said you don't have to go back to nicaragua why do you guys have to go because anybody can do what you do anybody can feed a child anybody can care for the sick you don't even need money to care for the sick anybody can build a church with resources and anybody can train pastors that's properly equipped and trained they meant it for good but my heart just hurt because i mean it's where the lord's called us right and those words just kind of kept spinning because we're in the middle of such uncertainty we just didn't know what we were supposed to do flew back to nicaragua and we had our meetings and we had three days left before the flight back out we gathered up our nicaraguan youth that are in our our program that we trained to do ministry and we went out to do ministry because we couldn't travel far around the country because of the roadblocks we began to do ministry really close to the capitol and we went out to visit our widows that day and you're going to see on the screen that this particular day we showed up to the home of a beautiful widow there she was standing in the door of her wooden home as we pulled up and as she saw our pickup pulled up she raised her hand and i didn't know what she was saying but i could see that she was happy and grateful we pulled up and i went into her little home and i looked around and she was just thanking the lord because we had come she had tears in her eyes and she said oh kendra we haven't eaten in three days and we've been praying that the lord would send someone thank you for coming she's a widow but she cares for orphans because she's a beautiful heart and when a little orphan boy's name is pedro and i said pedro where's your rice pot and he ran and he got the rice pot and he brought it back and he leans it over to show it to me it was completely empty completely dry not even a speck of dust from the previous rice no residue nothing who knows how long it had been since they had had rice in their home and then you know my heart broke because these are the people that god has called us to and i said we'll be back we're going to go find a store that's open and get you rice to fill that pot and so we laughed and we went to go find a store it was hard because there was a food shortage during this time and we found a corner store that was open and i remember the man had five big sacks of grains of beans and rice and i said to the man i need rice and he said how much i said a lot and he goes how much we sell it by the pound and i'm looking at that rice spot thinking i don't know and i ask our students and one of the girls in the ministry says tiakendra i think like maybe 20 pounds like 20 pounds that's a lot of rice and then i look down at the sacks and i see a sack that's like half full and so i just say well how much is that sack and he picks it up and he hangs it on a hook and he says 39.5 pounds well that's perfect i'll take it that's more than enough that'll just be overflowing with more than enough rice that's perfect let's just take it and he goes well i sell by the pound so you're going to have to take 40. and he leans over to scoop up a cup out of another bag and i said no no no no i'm already taking 39.5 and there's a food shortage like don't give me any more i'll pay the 40 but don't give him any more rice and we left and we went to your home and our students began to to pour that rice out of that sack and as we sat there in a circle there was so much happening the rice was pouring out of that sack and could hear the grains falling the little widow was sitting there staring at the rice with tears in her eyes because she was so overwhelmed by the provision of our god and then this little boy that or the the orphan he's looking at the rice just an aw i'm sure he was so excited that he was going to eat and as i'm just taking this moment in of how beautiful god is i begin to hear the the grains of rice trickling like there's no more rice and i couldn't really that didn't make sense to me because there was no way that that rice was gonna consume 39.5 pounds of rice that's a ton of rice but it did and as i looked down the last grain trickled out and there was like the rice had come to a perfect little peak and now i'm curious right because i'm like is it possible that the lid's gonna fit on this rice pot because you know the rice has to stay dry and they have to make sure that you know no rats or anything get into their rice and that pot the lid has to fit so i said put the lid i'm just curious to know and they patted down that rice and they put the lid on and it was a perfect fit if i would have taken the 20 pounds that the one of our girls from the ministry said i wouldn't have filled the pot which was my heart and if i would have taken the 40 pounds that the man from the store told me to take i just would have had a little too much it would have been great it would have been great but it wouldn't have been perfect and the in the lid wouldn't have fit perfectly and then in that moment when that lid went down and it clicked and you could hear the rice like rubbing against the top of the lid like it was a perfect fit the lord spoke to my heart and he said kendra anybody can do what you do it's true anybody can do it anybody can feed a child anybody can care for the sick anybody can build a church anybody can train pastors but you're doing it but you're doing it this lady hadn't eaten in three days why but you're doing it so keep on doing it so keep on doing it and this morning i want to say to you that if you're doing it if you're in the church if you're serving if you're doing something for the lord that he's put in your heart to do then don't give up then keep on doing it because he's given you his favor and his grace and his anointing and at all the abilities that you might think aren't enough he's given you the ability to do it so keep on doing it and if you're not doing it why not because if you get in and you do it then god's gonna bless you he's gonna give you his favor and his anointing and his mercy and his grace to give you the capacity to do what he's asked you to do and it's beautiful because you never know when you're going to be the answer to someone else's prayer allow the lord to use you even though you think that somebody else could do it better it's okay they probably can it doesn't matter because you're doing it and keep on doing it and then that day as we gather together i asked the beautiful little widow that was there if we could pray for her because we wanted to pray and we wanted to believe that god would keep that rice pot full and that it would never go empty we gathered around and we began to pray and as we prayed and and nicaragua everybody prays out loud at the same time like you have no idea who's leading the prayer everybody's praying at the same time you can't even hear yourself and so they were praying and i stopped praying so that i can hear them pray and i hear this beautiful widow praying and she says gracias just thank you lord for hearing my prayer and for answering it so this morning we want to say thank you so much thank you for allowing us to be your hands and feet more importantly the lord's hands and feet to a dying nation that needs hope and needs healing thankfully our family shortly after we were evacuated we were allowed to go back into country because it's clear that the lord has called us there to do what we're doing and to keep on doing it and we just ask that you continue to pray for the people of nicaragua in missions there's a perfect fit just like that lid on that rice and it looks like this the lord has called people called people like us our family and many other families that you guys know this church supports 40 to go to other nations around the world to share the gospel with people who have not yet heard it to bring hope and healing to people who have not yet received it he's given us the holy spirit to guide us he's given us people in these other countries with great needs to be met and he's given us the church to give and to pray and we say thank you ecic for doing that and partnering with us may god bless you [Applause] amen amen it was a perfect fit because we knew the truth we know the truth we know the truth that god is always with us we also know the truth of our king that he has people like my wife just mentioned people like yourself standing in the gap praying we know the truth that god goes before us that the battle belongs to the lord and this morning as i close this our time up this morning if i can invite the worship team back up i want to remind us of another key thing i already said it another key thing that god has placed on my heart as a missionary for the last 15 years one was that he's always with us the second thing is that know the truth know the truth of the king i want to encourage everyone and speaking of encouragement hopefully you've been encouraged by the testimony of the first testimony about cross how god is a god that heals he knows what we're going through and sometimes life's hard there's struggles there's up and downs even as a missionary there's struggles but we know that we don't wrestle between flesh and blood but against evil principalities but greater is he that lives within us than he that lives in the world and as we celebrated a few weeks ago the same power that rose christ from the grave you know lives inside us for those that believe but i want to encourage us as we end our time this morning about truth i want to encourage us to lean into the truth in ephesians chapter 6 apostle paul writes to the ephesians church to encourage the church he's in prison at the time but he wanted to encourage the church to put on the full armor of god and maybe recognize that but the very first piece of armor apostle paul encourages the church to put on daily is the belt of truth see that belt of truth the belt stabilizes the rest of the armor we're in a spiritual fight each and every day and thank god that he is for us that he's not against us but this morning as we close i don't know your story i don't know what you're going through but as missionaries to nicaragua we see things that that are hard that are sad that make us scratch our head and we're thankful for men and women like yourself that pray for missions that support us to be your arms and hands extended to the country of nicaragua but let me remind you of the truth this morning in god's presence this is truth there is peace there is rest there is joy there is hope there is confidence there is strength see that is truth even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me see god is doing a new thing just as we provide food for over 90 000 kids each and every day at noon we know it's not about just putting food in their bellies or clothes on their backs because without jesus in their heart they can walk to eternity of hell and this morning it's an honor to share an update of how god is using this church in nicaragua but i want to give all of us an opportunity to allow god to touch you five years ago when we were last here we may have shared this story we were in the garbage dump just helping people showing christ's love in a practical way helping them pick up recyclables faster so they can cash it in so they can eat that's just their income that's their life but one day a paralyzed guy who got hit by a taxi knew that there was sweaty gringos in the garbage dump praying for people and helping people collect trash so he made it his way he found a horse and buggy car he made his way to the dump he just wanted to prayer for he leaned into the truth he kind of put that bout of truth on that day and said and we prayed for him that day immediately we didn't see anything happen we loaded up and we left around 20 minutes down the road my wife receives a phone call that's from a lady that was helping us by the garbage dump and said hey that guy you prayed for that was paralyzed he is standing right now and screaming there's fire in my legs there's fire in my legs see god healed him that wasn't the only miracle that day because immediately he ran five kilometers into town i can barely run two blocks without getting tired this guy was paralyzed god healed him and he ran and around a month later when we came back he came up to us and said where can i go to worship the god that healed me because that was their community that garwish dumped there was no church in the area but thanks to ecic thanks to this church for your support and missions for praying for missionaries we were able you guys were able to help build a church right at the entrance of that dump and today there's around 160 175 people worshipping the lord thanks to the heart of east coast international church in closing will you stand with me as we close in prayer pastor kirk mentioned that you guys know about the altar i just want to invite you to the altar hopefully you've been encouraged by the testimonies but this morning as we close put the belt or truth on i don't know what you're going through maybe fear and anxiety has been just gripping you but the bout of truth says god is for you he is not against you and he has plans for you a hope and a future not for harm so as we close in prayer step out step out in faith and let god touch you like you touch cross in that testimony as he met that need of esperanza in the second testimony maybe a physical touch maybe for a family member step out and bring it that god heal you like a hill maximum at the dump of being paralyzed they're having a father lord i thank you for this congregation i thank you for this church as they step out in faith as they put the bout of truth around them lord i pray the name of jesus that you just minister to them lord be the lifter of their heads fill this church each individual with your peace and your joy deliver them the ones who are battling addiction and struggles father god i pray in the name of jesus lord that you take that addiction away that you should set him apart father god thank you lord for allowing us to be alive for such a time as this in 2022 lord that you have plans for us lord that you are for us and not against us lord that you put a robe on our back a finger our a ring on our finger uh sandals on our feet you call us unto yourself because you're the king of kings and you're in your lord almighty there's nothing that's impossible with you lord we thank you for your love for us and we thank you lord that you are a holy god and that you hate sin lord that this morning that we can repent this morning we can come to you and you will wash us clean lord thank you lord for your forgiveness thank you lord for your mercy which is new each and every day and thank you father god for who you are there's nothing that we can say people listen this morning there's nothing that we can say or do this morning for you for god to love us anymore thank you lord for loving us thank you lord for touching us meet needs this morning here at this place for your glory in jesus name we pray amen let's worship the lord", "service thank you the most repeated question by jesus during his ministry was this have you never read have you never read underneath that simple question is a life-altering implication you should read the word of god that's why jesus also says man does not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of god [Music] jesus knows that there is a spiritual hunger inside of every human heart that can only be satisfied by consuming the words of god christian give yourself to the word of god the word of god is a rock strong and steady it doesn't budge break or crumble under pressure it's an anchor in the storm keeping us calm when everything around us is chaotic the word of god is a mirror showing us who we really are you don't just read the word of god it reads you it's a treasure beautiful in every dimension and worth every effort of discovery it brings endless joy and eternal riches to all who find it it's a fire spreading across the world to bring heat and light it's a river bringing life and power to everything it touches the word of god is a seed planted deep inside of our hearts producing the fruit of holiness and righteousness the word of god is a sword dividing true and false right and wrong good and evil it's a hammer crushing what needs to be crushed and breaking what needs to be broken it's a lamb to our feet and a light to show us our path so let the voice of god be the first the last and the loudest voice in your ear today tomorrow and for the rest of your life give yourself to the word of god all right that's great that's great hey good afternoon everybody it's great to be with you today thanks for joining us in revere and online as well we uh immediately after jesus made it exceptionally clear for the first time he revealed himself to the woman at the well the samaritan woman immediately after that the samaritan woman went and she became the first evangelist of jesus in the history of the world that was not an accident on so many levels after jesus was crucified and buried in a grave two women went to visit the grave only to find that the tombstone had been rolled away jesus was alive no longer in the grave and these two women became the first two humans in history to preach the good news of the resurrection of jesus christ in romans chapter 16 verse 7 you'll find a female apostle as well named junia i say this to say to you today that we believe strongly that women need to be involved biblically need to be involved in leadership and in preaching and in teaching and apostleship and so on [Applause] we don't believe this because it's 2022 and we're super woke that's not why we believe it people think that's why we believe it it's not why we believe it yeah we believe this when it wasn't popular the church that i grew up in was planted by a woman pastor the this is something that our movement strongly believes it's something that we understand the bible to strongly teach and so it is appropriate for us to call all of the women in our church to leadership not just the men and so young women especially i want you to hear that today i want you to know that we don't need fewer female pastors we need more female pastors and that's that's a true statement and so at our church we have some female pastors and we get an opportunity to sit under the ministry of pastor emily urbina today as she comes to preach the word of god so why don't we welcome pastor emily hello everyone thank you pastor kurt thank you so much for the opportunity to be here and share the word with you today and thank you church for being open and listening to what god might have to say to you this morning if you haven't signed up for a small group yet make sure you do so it's small group launch week this week which i'm very excited about we have 10 incredible volunteers from our church who have stepped up as small group leaders and a few staff as well there's some awesome awesome group opportunities so make sure you check that out alright everybody how's the daniel fest going [Music] going good if you didn't know we're just starting week three of the daniel fast this year and i just wanted to share with you um we've been doing it for a few years as a church and every year that i've participated i've come out of the daniel fast with more freedom in my life than i had when i went in and i think there's something powerful and unique about fasting together it's a little different than just doing it on your own and so i want to say thank you to those of you who are participating and those of you who haven't started yet or maybe haven't been doing it the way you want just know it's never too late to start you can start right now you can start right now don't miss out on what god has for you all right why don't we open up an award of prayer would you join me father we thank you so much we thank you so much there's so much to be grateful for god this morning would you speak to us would you speak to us holy spirit apply your word to our hearts god whatever it is that each of us needs to hear would you highlight it for us we thank you for your presence we thank you for your word that is never ending we pray these things in jesus name amen amen i want you to take a moment right now and think of a time that you had a craving think of a craving an example right now go ahead try and think of something doesn't have to be food it can be anything do you have that idea in your head oftentimes when we think of cravings we tend to think of extreme examples or really strange times like maybe a craving that you had if you ever tried quitting smoking cold turkey or a craving that you had if you were ever pregnant and couldn't couldn't get by without milk and pickles for some strange reason you know we tend to think of these odd examples but the truth is that cravings actually shape the course of our actions constantly we crave peace we crave social interactions we crave intimacy we crave pleasure can you imagine what your life would be like if you only craved that food that your body needed best if the only thing that you ever craved was fresh raw crunchy kale and a handful of organic blueberries that was it that's all you ever wanted right but instead we crave all sorts of really strange and often inappropriate things and craving itself is kind of a strange thing if you think about it it's different than hunger hunger is really straightforward hunger says hey you're running on empty you need to fill your tank but craving says ooh i think i want some of that oh i'd like some of this over here i need to have it right i've found that hunger is oftentimes it's a pretty trustworthy instinct but cravings are a little bit of a wild card oftentimes my cravings would lead me astray to consume or do something that isn't good for me or at a time that isn't good for me or in a way that isn't good for me anybody else suddenly crave a late night snack that they really shouldn't be happy i'm sure we can all think of some examples when we first did the daniel fast several years ago it was my first time doing a daniel fast and i was determined to go all in and so even though i was an avid coffee drinker i decided i was gonna fast caffeine as well those first three days i was the ugliest person i think i've ever been i was angry i was irritable i was rude i snapped at people at work at home in public i was thinking all sorts of mean thoughts honest with you was not pretty in there either i was having migraines all day i was detoxing from a really serious addiction to caffeine and sugar and i didn't expect it to hit me as hard as it did the sugar was the part that really surprised me because i don't think of myself as having a sweet tooth i'm really picky when it comes to sweet things i don't like cake or pastries that much i could go without candy but during the daniel fast it was like i had a radar for sugar like someone has sugar in their pocket over there like i could tell you know i could smell it i found myself being attracted to anything with sugar in it right someone opened a packet of those stale nasty styrofoam like wafer cookies at work one day and i started salivating i don't even like those i brought them to show you i like these things you know i don't know if you like these so i'm sorry to be like yucking your yum if this is your favorite snack but gross and i was salivating over it it was just a strange time but after three days things calmed down and i was finally able to really enjoy the daniel fast and focus on what was important but in my head i still wanted to eat all of those rich luxurious foods that i had been used to eating before and i fell into the temptation trap of planning and daydreaming about how i would break the fast which in case you don't know is not the point of a fast right that's kind of the opposite of the point of the past but i was thinking oh what am i going to do what am i gonna do and so i landed on going to my favorite fast food restaurant to break the fast i went to five guys normally if you're gonna break a fast you you know if you're smart about things you go gentle no take it easy just one step at a time i i didn't do it that time i wasn't being very smart i wasn't being very restrained about it i just dug into one of those big juicy hamburgers with all the fixings and a mountain of crispy golden french fries and that delicious peanut oil and i had a lovely refreshing cool soda on the side and then afterwards of course we stopped at starbucks for our favorite sugary drink that we had been missing not only did i feel unwell after eating all that i began to feel as though something was missing it was a strange some sensation and i remember it distinctly because it was the first time that i thought to myself man i'm really craving a salad right now a salad like i was craving leaves you know that's weird and that feeling didn't go away and whenever i go too long without eating vegetables i begin to feel it i think man i really need to eat something real something nutritious no something green and that's when i learned that you crave what you consume you crave what you consume if there's something that you're regularly eating eventually if you go without it you're probably going to have a craving for it now don't get me wrong you know sometimes there are random cravings for things you haven't had in years that come in there or you crave something that you really know isn't good for you but to some degree to some degree you can change your cravings if you commit to consuming things that you want to crave so that's a question i want to ask you this morning what do you want to crave what do you want to consume what do you want to be the thing that fuels you i'm inviting you today to develop a craving for god's words jesus gave us a great example of controlling his cravings right in the beginning of his ministry the holy spirit led him to get away from other people and spend some time in solitude in prayer and fasting and meditating on scripture so jesus wasn't eating any food so you could focus on spending time with god right and matthew 4 3-4 tells us that during that time the devil came and said to him if you are the son of god tell these stones to become loaves of bread but jesus told him no the scriptures say people do not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god jesus had chosen his fuel he was already feasting on the word of god and just like jesus we get to make god's word our fuel we want to make god's word your fuel when i was a kid i attended a school in a country called vanuatu and the school was just one big room with desks we didn't have a cafeteria right so every day the kids would bring lunch money and during recess we'd go to nearby stores and buy our food for the rest of the day that means that children got to decide what their fuel would be for the rest of the day you can imagine how that might have gone at first i did what all the other kids did my best friend taught me that you can eat ramen noodles right out of the bag and just dry crunch you know it's got a nice crunch to it yeah and if you lick your finger which you haven't washed probably and dip it in the seasoning it's like a new vanuatu fun dip right it was very cool it was very cool time we also had a fantas chicken flavored crackers that was a big favorite but mostly the kids bought candy all sorts of candy we bought candy we pooled our candy we traded candy we would stash our candy for when we were bored at school we would use candy to make bets so that recess was more interesting i did this every day until one day i was struck by the savory sweet scent of freshly baked bread wafting on the slow warm breeze in this little open aired store so i walked over to the shelf and i saw these the small batch of figure eight shaped fried breads not a croissant but you know visual for you the breads were much better than whatever that is i saw these breads and i was immediately captivated i opted for bread that day it was a little bit more expensive than than the other stuff i was used to eating and so i only had money for the piece of bread and a fruit i didn't get any candy that day but i was looking for something different than that still crunchy ramen noodle that i had been eating with all the cool kids and that lunch changed me i was hooked i loved that bread and i came i became very familiar with it i could tell when they were trying to sell yesterday's bread i could tell uh when there was someone different making the batch i missed it when somebody skipped a day and even to this day i still think about that bread sometimes it's pretty ridiculous but it was so good it was so delicious and that's how god's word is it's the best fuel it's fresh every day and it's unendingly meaningful it's challenging it's comforting actually if you read the bible you learn about how awesome the bible is hebrews says that god's word is alive and active and second timothy tells us that it's useful for teaching and correcting and rebuking and training in righteousness so that we'll be able to do everything that god has for us psalm 119 tells us that when we're in the dark and we don't know where to go god's word is like a light for our path and it tells us that young people can stay pure praise god's word is blessed and isaiah taught that it endures forever psalm 18 rejoices over the fact that god's word is flawless and that it can become a refuge for us and i know for me when i'm lost when i'm overwhelmed when i am destroying my own life there's nothing that can reach me more deeply nothing that can touch me in the darkest furthest places than the word of god i've come to resonate with psalm 130 verse 5 and 6 it says i am counting on god yes i am counting on him i've put my hope in his word i long for the lord more than centuries long for the dawn yes more than centuries long for the dawn you might ask well how can the bible recommend itself isn't that a little biased of the bible the answer is no because it's much more than a book we're not just talking about becoming familiar with a book we're talking about hearing from god we never we must never separate god from the bible or separate the bible from god some people say oh i'm very sensitive to spiritual things and i hear from god all the time so i don't need that outdated book that person is a fool because they've made themselves their own judge and so they're vulnerable to lies and there's a lot of spiritual sounding lies out there or on the flip side the person who reads the bible is merely an academic pursuit i'm trying to gain knowledge and and fill my head up with all of this information james puts it well he says don't just listen to god's word you must do what it says otherwise you're only fooling yourselves what good is it to hear from god and then ignore him instead we have this record it's an ancient record it's passed down from generations and it tells us of the creator god's dealings with humanity it stood the test of time and it will continue to stand the test of time it will continue to be a dependable fuel for anyone who is willing to consume it and by it we know jesus who has changed my life and who's changed the lives of billions of people throughout human history there's a really interesting story in john chapter 6 and it's quite long so i've brought it down a little bit but if you want to read the whole thing you can starting in verse 26 jesus is speaking to a crowd and he says i tell you the truth you want to be with me because i fed you not because you understood the miraculous signs but don't be so concerned about perishable things like food instead spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the son of man can give you yes i am the bread of life i am the living bread that came down from heaven anyone who eats this bread will live forever and this bread which i will offer so the world may live is my flesh i live because of the living father who sent me in the same way anyone who feeds on me will live because of me now at this point many of his disciples turned away and they deserted him they didn't like that teaching jesus turned to the 12 and he asked are you also going to leave and simon peter replied lord to whom would we go you have the words that give eternal life this passage along with many others speak to a theme in scripture the very theme that we're talking about today it's the connection between the ideas that humans are consumers and god in his word are what we were designed to consume and this is a really spiritual sounding concept it's pretty abstract but there are some very practical ways that you can begin to walk this out if you're going to make god's word your fuel number one you need to listen to god's word reading also counts read your bible meditate on your bible spend time in prayer listening if you're not familiar already with an app called youversion i would encourage you to check it out put it on your phone youversion is a bible app that will read the bible to you and it just you got that bible with you anywhere you go you can put it on anytime it's an awesome awesome tool that can revolutionize your relationship with bible reading if you're going to make god's word your fuel you need to read god's word and number two you need to do this with regularity i i would recommend doing this on a daily basis right i think jesus also recommends a daily basis he taught us to pray give us today our daily bread and number three you need to apply god's words to your life now if you're not really sure how to do those things they sound like something that you haven't quite gotten started with i'd encourage you to check out a bible coaching group you can sign up for it on the church center app those groups are designed for people who are brand new to the bible and want to learn how to read it and what it means and ask good questions about it and figure out what it what it has to do with their lives so you can check that out on the bible on the church center app if you're interested so what have we learned so far when you develop a craving for god's word and you make god's word your fuel you'll see change in your life because we're talking about much more than reading a book or even hearing from god we're talking about letting the word take charge we want to let the word take charge god's word has this really interesting way of coming into a situation and just cleaning house if you let him he'll show you things that you were blind to or he'll show you things that you were turning a blind eye to maybe you've been letting the fear of rejection or the comfort of chaos be your fuel maybe you've been letting your cravings run wild and lead you into danger zones whatever's been going on the word of god will bring change and growth if you let it take charge in your life you'll begin to see depths of anger and unforgiveness replaced with depths of gratitude you'll see insecurity transformed in the safety of his presence and you'll see the pressure of self-reliance dissolve into the freedom that's in faith it's a lot like chef gordon ramsay if you aren't familiar with chef gordon ramsay right he's a world famous chef with really foul mouth and david and i recently had the pleasure of uh watching a few episodes of a show called kitchen nightmares i don't know if anybody's heard of it i don't recommend it but it was interesting basically what happens in every episode is this world-class chef comes into a mom-and-pop restaurant situation that is crumbling and failing and he begins to reveal problems left and right and he brings this gut punch of truth followed by the kind of intense encouragement that only a true expert someone who really knows what they're talking can give and then he totally transforms the space giving them all these really cool upgrades that they couldn't have afforded on their own and then he gives them the tools and the skills they need to succeed word is a lot like that god is a lot not like that he's very different from chef ramsay first of all his words are pure second of all he's he's gentle that's one of god's characteristics he's a gentle god and he's full of love but if you let him he will come in and he will clean house and he will call you up and he'll give you the tools that you need to live more purposefully god's words to you are strength and comfort and wisdom and hope but more than just tools that you can use how you want god's word is creative it's powerful the same god who commanded the universe to exist is the one who wants to speak to you and when he speaks even the wind and the waves of the ocean obey him his words created all time and space and the crowning accomplishment of all of his beautiful creation was to make you to make human kind if you listen to him he will speak to your very soul and he will tell you the secrets of your own purpose there is nothing more sustaining to us than god's word deuteronomy chapter 8 talks about way back in the day when the jews were leaving egypt they were leaving slavery in egypt and they were journeying to israel this beautiful land that god had invited them to come to so they could have a home base from which to operate during that time they had to learn on that journey they had to learn to depend on god even more than they depended on food and it's that same passage that jesus was quoting when satan was tempting him to turn the stone into bread when he said man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god right the people of israel they needed to let the word take charge so that they could fulfill their purpose and even jesus needed to let god's word take charge so that he could fulfill his ultimate purpose how much more do we need to let god's word take charge so that we can fulfill our ultimate purpose we're talking about much more than developing the discipline of being a good reader the whole point of reading this book of reading the bible is getting close to the one who made you satisfying your soul's deepest craving depending on him to be your fuel the sustainer of your life and letting him take charge as the worship team comes up i'd like to share a story when i was younger i had the opportunity to visit an indigenous people group in costa rica called the cabeca people they lived on a large reservation of land and they were well cut off from the rest of the country almost no one spoke spanish there and money was of no use to them in order to get into the village we were visiting we had to drive until we reached the very end of a very long dirt road and we got out and there we met a man who was to be our guide and he had brought a donkey with us with him to help us carry our load we met him exchanged introductions and he began guiding us through the jungle along a riverbank into his village we checked with him for a few hours initially i understood this man to be our guide and a sort of village liaison between them and the rest of the world and he had this special role because of his basic fluency in spanish which allowed him to trek into the nearest city and trade leaves from the jungle for kerosene for the village it turns out if you live in an almost garden of eden like jungle one of the few things that you care to have from modern society is a little bit of light so that you can do things after the sun goes down so that was his role and since i also had a sort of fluency in spanish i spoke with him along the journey and he shared with me that he was very excited because they had recently completed the construction of a church building in his village it was the first ever the first ever and the only church building in that area among his people and i began to ask more oh what is it like what are the people like you come to your church what do you guys do and the more questions i asked the more confused i became he was giving me very strange responses but over the course of our time there i came to understand this sweet humble man had met some christians when he was trading for kerosene in the city and they invited him to church and he began and they began to tell him about jesus [Music] as they shared god's word with him he became captivated he sensed a craving to know more [Music] and so every time he went into the city he would visit them again he would try to learn more he would ask more questions he'd go to another church service he shared with me that those visits had become so important to him they were becoming his fuel now he didn't get to go every week like we do they only needed to go into the city when it was time for them to buy more kerosene and he became eager to have a church in his own community so he reached out for help and a short-term missionary came to his village and began translating the bible into their language and so they translated the gospel of john just one book out of this whole book right the gospel of john into their native language and then they translated a few hymns as well a couple songs for them to sing and this man became the de facto pastor in his community there wasn't anyone else there to do there wasn't anyone else there who knew about jesus i was really impacted by this man i was deeply impressed by him normally i think of pastors as people who get at least a little bit of respect for the role that they play but this guy didn't get any respect as a matter of fact his village kind of looked at him and they were worried like this guy was going off the rails he went into the city came back with some really strange ideas but what could they do he was the one who spoke spanish he was the representative for their village the only one that could get the kerosene he had access to everyone in his community because he was the one who would come back around with the kerosene that everybody wanted and even though they had thought he was kind of weird it didn't stop him he couldn't wait to get more of the bible translated he wanted to understand more about jesus he wanted to be able to share more and he diligently worked to keep church services going and he kept inviting his whole community to hear god's word even though it was mostly the same songs every week and they only had one gospel [Music] this man had allowed the word to take charge in his life and it was so beautiful to watch [Music] he had fallen in love with jesus and he was hanging on god's every word he was desperate for more he was craving it i want to be like that man and i want us to be like that man you imagine what would happen if we would develop a craving for god's word [Music] if we would let it be what fuels us day in and day out the thing that sustains us and if we would let it take charge in our lives we would be at our very best would you stand to your feet with me today i'm inviting you to a lifetime full of harvesting incredible truths from the abundance of this book i'm inviting you to invest in your relationship with god with future conversations that you're going to have with him by spending time getting to know the things that he said the things that he cares about the things that he thinks i'm inviting you to become familiar with his voice by becoming familiar with these pages i'm inviting you to cash in on promises that were made for you before you were ever born this book is your invitation [Music] these words are the foundation of a relationship that is more profound than you could possibly guess don't miss out make a decision today to dig in and feast on the word of god [Music] and if you already know the word today if you love the word if you have a relationship with it you live by it and my invitation is to help others discover a love for the word of god if you're looking for practical ways to do that reach out to me that's what i'm all about right now and lastly if you're here today and you're just hurting and maybe this message feels like a good idea for another time but what about today you're in need today i'd encourage you to come forward to the altar as we sing a song people will pray over you come meet with the good shepherd before we sing i just want to read this chapter from the bible to you i'm reading it over you

and um I want to thank you for having open open ears and Open Hearts today to to listen to what the Holy Spirit might want to bring you through the message so um we're continuing our Series today on tearing down strongholds yeah this has been a good one I've been enjoying it this is week six um and this sermon today it comes with a prayer it's actually the title of the sermon God give us a growth Vision can you say that with me God give us a growth Vision all right let's pray real quick while we jump in Father we thank you so so much for what you're doing here in this church in our lives God we're excited we are excited to see what you're doing God and we want to ask you today to continue to deepen what you're doing to to continue to move us forward to help us father to catch a glimpse of your vision for this church God and to be motivated and inspired to participate with what you want to do God Not to grow weary but to continue to work and partner with you God help us and show us how father we give you this time and we pray these things in Jesus name am amen amen all right as we jump into the sermon today I have an announcement to make we are pregnant not David and I not David and I okay if you keep asking us about it you know you can just stop we don't need to worry about the next one okay we you and I us this church is pregnant this church is growing this church is an expanding family I don't know if you've noticed but God is doing something here to grow this church family Can you feel it can you feel it happening it's happening right all around us and I'm excited about it I just want to make sure we know today God is not finished he isn't done moving here he isn't done working on you as a matter of fact Ephesians 4 tells us that God is at work growing us until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's son that we will be mature in the Lord measuring up to the full and complete standard of christall and right now we have the opportunity to decide if we are going to partner with God and lean in to the growth or if we're going to be the greatest obstacle to his will there's a few myths out there about growth some people think that it's automatic you know with the passing of time it just happens some people think that if they just show up they'll grow or if they just learn enough then they'll grow spiritually but that isn't true at all haven't you met any of the people who've been going to church for decades they can quote the Bible up and down but when you look at them they look distinctly not at all like Jesus have you met any of those people what's up with those people are they like just evil people that hate God no for the most part those people are a bunch of spiritual babies who didn't grow when they had the chance to and before we talk too bad about those people let's take a good look at ourselves and make sure that we are not those people because the truth is that spiritual growth never stops you're never done growing it takes a great deal of effort it takes a lot of change and it absolutely requires help from others but East Coast International Church I am certain that God who began the good work within you will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Christ Jesus returns amen so wait if if God's doing the work if he's the grower why do we have to worry about it because you can either promote what God is doing or you could get in the way of your own growth some of you might have heard me talk about how I had the chance to live on two different islands when I was growing up I lived on a tropical island and I lived on a desert island the tropical island of aat was characterized by an abundance of fruitfulness so much so that I got used to just walking around and just picking fruit to snack on as I went wherever I went I used to walk a mile to school and and when I was on my way back sometimes my sister and I would decide to take a scenic route to delay our arrival to homework in one of those days we walked through a residential neighborhood and we were just chat we were just chatting without even thinking about it I reached up and grabbed a banana you can go ahead and put that picture on the screen if you got it I reached up and grabbed the bananas I was passing and I started munching on it I was so used to doing this wherever I went I it hadn't occurred to me that I was stealing and all of a sudden an older gentleman yelled at me any banana me and I like I was so startled I just started running I started running I got about half a block away when I realized I had just stolen a banana from that man's yard it was you know kind of hanging over in the public walkway but by the time I figured it out there was there was kind of nothing we could do cuz I had already eaten half the banana and so we just kind of like looked at each other and he just like you know sat back down and I just with a mouthful of delicious tree ripened fruit was just like sorry just we just kept walking but you know what it worked out because that place was so abundant in fruitfulness didn't really make a huge impact but the desert island where I lived that Island struggled with scarcity of resources so we lived in a house that actually had a fruit tree in the yard and the yard had a gate around it and the landlord there had two guard dogs but she had hired a handyman who had kind of gotten friendly with the guard dogs right so this guy would actually sneak onto the property and steal all the fruit from the tree all of the fruit our cashew not cashew is the nuts these fruits here anybody had those those are those are some Cura fruits right there desert fruits anyways he actually tried to sucker my dad into buying back some of the fruits when we were new to the island and that was hilarious um but we finally you know we made friends with him and we just said you know what it's okay you can come on to the property and take the fruit that way we he wouldn't be a thief anymore so you know God grows fruit on both of those islands but the environment either promotes or prohibits the fruitfulness so what is the condition of your heart today is your heart stubborn and opinionated is it anxious or panicked is your heart listening does your heart bow to God God vision is that you would have a soft heart for Him in Ezekiel 36:26 he says and I will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit in you and I will take out your Stony stubborn heart and give you a tender responsive heart and I'll put my spirit in you so that you'll follow my decrees and be careful to obey my commands my regulations amen and as we ask God to give us a growth Vision today think for a moment does my lifestyle my attitude my choices does it promote spiritual growth I ask it again does my lifestyle my attitude my choices do they promote spiritual growth if you're not sure how to promote spiritual growth today I'd encourage you to jump in a little bit deeper come to connect night on Wednesday days do the Bible goals with us sign up for Bible coaching or talk to me about spiritual sponsorship or find a way to volunteer at the church start joining in with what we're doing as a church at a greater level and let us help you move forward on your spiritual journey in addition to promoting spiritual growth in order to have a god-given vision for growth we must believe the spiritual growth is actually possible amen have you ever mistaken a milestone for a Finish Line people do this often with spiritual growth especially when you look around at the people in your life and you're tempted to think that you are Beyond everyone else when it comes to spirituality or knowing Jesus when I was a social worker at the Haven project I used to see this a lot I I worked with young adults who had experienced homelessness and we were helping set them up for a healthy successful future I would find that my Haven clients perspective on adulthood had been shaped by the adults in their lives and often times they were already doing better than the adults that they knew occasionally we'd have a young adult who knew better who did better they just needed a little assistance and they were off but often times we had clients who didn't know any better they thought the end goal was to get their Section 8 voucher that's what adulthood is now it's in my name their biggest aspiration literally to let their lives be rough enough and to wait long enough to get their own voucher and then they'd be all set right because once you get your section 8 voucher all your problems are gone forever so we're trying to help them we're trying to get them excited about skill setting up and building a resume and developing critical thinking skills and free education opportunities we're trying to set them up for their future but they don't have a clue what use those things have to them right us Lord know sometimes we'd celebrate their victories along the way because we wanted them to see they are making progress with each step but every once in a while I noticed their celebration for an accomplishment was a little bit more like what you'd expect at a Finish Line than what you'd expect at a mile marker it be something like I applied for five jobs I can't believe I did it now I can relax and they would relax so hard they wouldn't charge their phone they wouldn't get an interview they wouldn't show up for anything they wouldn't get a job right it didn't work out it didn't work out that way and sometimes they look at someone else in the room and they they'd think I I did more than that person so I think I'm done for the day one kid with a bright mind and every reason to go to college would look at another kid with debilitating mental illness and be jealous of the disability check and then they'd start having an attitude of you know forget about FAFSA forget about my AP exam you know what forget about high school Alto together would start creeping up on them I had one young man who shared with me how strange he thought it was that I kept reminding him not to swear in the dropin center it was a rule we had so clients you know could practice having kind of language that might be more appropriate for certain professional settings and you know he would ask me if I swore like no you know I don't swear you say what about when you're off of work no not when I'm off what about when you're at home no I what about if you stub your toe you don't even swear when you stub your toe like no I don't and he would tell me that everyone he knows swears his whole world everyone it's hard to keep growing when you are already surpassing the goals that everyone around you has set yes just like how some of these clients were products of an entire ecosystem that produced young adults with limited aspirations some of us may have reached the top of what we know about spirituality you know sometimes I find myself thinking this this church is awesome this is the best Church like in the whole world CH is right but it's actually a little bit of a danger thought you know because if we start thinking about how great we are man I'm saved I'm good right I have read the whole Bible I'm good you know I already read that thing or I hear from God sometimes I know he loves me I am so good and secure I've got my spiritual disciplines in place I even fast sometimes you know I spend some personal time with Jesus multiple times a week I'm raising my children to come to church and know about God I am so good we're good it's all good but are we growing are we still growing are you still growing and what's next for you you know to have a growth perspective you need to have an aim a vision this is the concept behind vision boards you know if you visualize where your headed you're going to work a little bit harder you'll end up achieving more right but God has a vision for your growth and it's all written throughout the Bible you were made in His image called to follow Jesus to grow up to be like Jesus so much so that you actually embody Jesus Will on the earth you know he calls you his body but how many of us can be honest and say when we stare at Jesus when we really look you know he's just light years away from us is it an unrealistic goal to be like Jesus you might read verses like be perfect like your heavenly father is perfect and the cognitive dissonance is there when I read the Bible my inner posture is like yes God Amen but I read a verse like that and I'm like yes amen God but you know have you seen me lately perfect I okay hold on I'll be honest with you there are things that God is calling me to right now that seem impossible from where I stand today and when we really look at Jesus and we realize how long of a journey we have to go sometimes when we think we reached a goal and we find out it was just the first leg of the journey it was just a mile marker that wasn't the Finish Line the discouragement can can hit pretty hard yes but let's take a look at what God says to us this command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you and it is not beyond your reach it is not kept in heaven so distant that you must ask who will go up to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and Obey it is not kept Beyond the Sea so far away that you must ask who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and Obey no the message is very close at hand it's on your lips it's in your heart so you can obey it now listen today I have given you the choice between life and death between blessings and curses now I call Heaven and Earth to witness the choice you make oh that you would choose life so that you and your descendants might live you can make this Choice by loving the Lord your God obeying him and committing yourself firmly to him this is the key to your life Hallelujah second Peter teaches us by his divine power God has given us everything we need for living a Godly life we have received all of this by coming to know him the one who called us to himself by means of His Marvelous glory and excellence and because of his glory and Excellence he has given us us great and precious promises these are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human Desires in view of all this make every effort to respond to God's promises supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral Excellence moral Excellence with knowledge and knowledge with self-control and self selfcontrol with patient endurance and patient endurance with godliness and godliness with brotherly affection and brotherly affection with love for everyone the more you grow like this the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but those who fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins so dear brothers and sisters SS work hard to prove that you really are among those God has called and chosen do these things and you will never fall away then God will give you a grand entrance into the Eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ thank you Lord the biblical perspective is that the kind of growth that might seem Out Of Reach to us the kind of godliness and fruitfulness that might seem like it's only for the brightest people it's only for the mother teresas of the world no that kind of growth is for you in Jesus it is Within Reach maybe you're feeling like you're too tired Matthew 11:28 Jesus said I will give you rest maybe you feel like you can't go on but Psalm 915 God's grace is sufficient maybe you feel like you can't figure things out but God will direct your steps according to Proverbs 3:5 maybe you feel like you can't do it but Philippians 4:13 says you can do all things maybe you feel like I'm not able but 2 Corinthians 9:8 says God is able maybe you feel like it's not worth it but Romans 8:28 reminds us it will be worth it all maybe you feel like you can't forgive yourself but 1 John 1:9 says God will forgive you or you feel like you can't manage but God will supply all your needs or you feel like you need to be fearful but God doesn't give you fear but love and power and a sound mind maybe you're worried and you're frustrated and God says cast all your cares on Me Maybe you think I'm not smart enough but God gives you wisdom maybe you think you're all alone but God says I will never leave you and according amen amen you know the Bible has the answer there according to Ephesians 2:19 you are a member of God's family and together and with God's help we can grow into the vision that he has for us you know spiritual growth is powerful yes it Jesus talks about his vision for us in Matthew 13 He said the Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard a seed planted in a field it's the smallest of all seeds but it becomes the largest of garden plants it grows into a tree and birds come and make nests in its branches this is what we are becoming spiritual growth is powerful because it makes us a safe haven for people who need shelter and know some of you are trying to save the world you are trying to be the Savior but you can't do it Jesus is the savior but when you grow spiritually something miraculous happens you grow to have peace to occupy more and more space in the world and to have peace overflowing into that space and that you occupy and people start to come around you and they get a taste of that peace that Jesus has been growing in you spiritual growth is powerful because your fruitfulness nourishes those around you you know when I was growing up my group of friends would always get to know about the food habits of our families and our neighbors for example we knew which houses had juice and soda and which ones only had water and milk we also knew that Mr Garner always gave out full-size Snickers at Halloween time we knew that some of my friends homes didn't have any food for us in there my one friend's parents had a certain kind of snack that was rationed strictly only one oatmeal cream pie per kid otherwise you had to wait for an actual Meal Time and sit down and stay for the whole thing which would involve math riddles because his dad was a math teacher my parents would always try to feed us leftovers or baloney sandwiches if we came sniffing around for food inside we never had any snacks but most of all we discovered that the twins parents had popsicles and we could make ramen noodles at their house whenever we wanted so we were there a lot when your life has the good snacks the overabundance of bananas the overflowing spiritual Vitality the neighborhood kids like to visit because they're unnourished by the fruitfulness of your spiritual growth you see that see how I'm tying it all together there it's good this is one of the things that I enjoy about my husband we like to take car rides together and it's my favorite thing when David says casually hey can I tell you about something God's been talking to me about yes that's awesome you know and sometimes even more than just encouraging me or challenging me I actually find that David will tell me that God told him something and as he's telling me about it the holy spirit will say to me that's for you too Emily and it'll change my life you know David has casually shared things with me that God has used to change my life that's amazing now Philippians 1:9 says I pray that your love will overflow more and more and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding and may you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ for this will bring much glory and praise to God am the galatian church was dealing with some serious persecution when the letter to them was written the book of Galatians when Paul visited the cities in galatia he kept getting run out by mobs angry mobs of people would literally kick him out of the city they even stoned him a few times that's not a few Stones a few times a whole bunch of people threw a lot of stones at him multiple times one time time to the point they thought he had died and then he got back up and went back into the City and had a last prayer service before he had it out the Jews hated the Christians in galatia the Romans were brutal to anybody that was perceived as a troublemaker but look at what Paul tells the suffering Church the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control there is no law against these things Hallelujah maybe people are unhappy with you they're frustrated with you they they don't like the way you're living because you're causing changes in the world for Jesus remember no one can ban goodness everybody wants to be around someone who's patient and loving we all need to be surrounded by peace and joy and as you experience spiritual growth your life produces the kind of fruit the fruit of the spirit of God and it actually begins to meet the spiritual needs of people around you and it's a beautiful thing another reason spiritual growth is so powerful is because as you grow you actually build the family of God do you know that we had five teenagers get baptized last month that was awesome yeah and one of the things that I loved so much about that was I I saw the all-in team they they were there the teens there were cheering these teens on celebrating this spiritual move that they made and hugging them in the water and I'm proud to see this generation of new Believers rising up and it's not just the teenagers either there's people here in this room today they are new Believers and you're rising up up and I'm proud to be rising up alongside you amen you inspire me to keep growing and hopefully we Inspire each other to keep growing and together we continue to become more like Jesus worship team would you come join me on the stage let me tell you one last story there was once this elderly couple they had been married for well over 50 years and they were just beginning to see their grand children start families of their own and they were wholesome people with quirky little Hobbies but they always found some creative way to bless somebody with those Hobbies they were very hospitable they had established a beautiful space for themselves that had all the Hallmarks of a good home right there was always one room for one more person at the table their guest room was often filled with a visitor or sometimes somebody who would stay longer until they got on their feet this couple was sweet s and lighthearted and full of joy they also kind of leaked wisdom effortlessly you they'd be doing something simple like folding laundry or shoveling snow and they just casually would say something that would just speak right to the soul of a person that was right there with them they loved children they were patient and stressful situations their peace did not come from peaceful circumstances but from God they were still reading their Bibles and still learning something new or gaining new insights deeper insights they were still able to be amazed by the simple truths of the Gospel their children learned from them and were doing great things and each generation it seemed inherited benefits and Grace and wisdom from the one before and that whole family was every single one doing something awesome in the world that makes Jesus smile Hallelujah the story of that elderly couple is our story it's the story of who we are becoming as we grow and build God's family in this corner of the earth look around at you this is beautiful yes it do you know the stories of the brothers and sisters that are sitting beside you do you know what God's been doing in their lives now God has growing us into a natural light filled Orchard landscaped by the harvests that we produce each year and ever expanding not the sterile lines of a farm but the unpredictably intermingled Trees of an oasis God is not done here he is still growing us and we must choose to promote the work that he's doing in us to believe that it is possible to be what he envisions that we become and to allow him to do something so powerful that it exceeds our imagining would you stand to your feet with [Music] me you know you're made for a different reality that starts here but it's actually Eternal you are made for the garden you're made for paradise and your new spiritual existence is fueled it's not by your efforts but by the infinite power of God and he's chosen to utilize your participation and the help of his other children since before you were born God's been plotting to get you back to being close with him man he loves loves [Music] you he loves you and we're going to get to enjoy The Nearness of God in unhindered Purity and Glory when he returns and he makes all things new but right now we get to do things with God that are unique to this time in the world there are things you can do with God now that you can't do later that's why it's so important that we grow that's why it's so important that we press in that's why it's so important that we keep saying yes to Jesus it's why it's so important that we don't allow complacency or apathy to have anything to do with our lifestyle amen maybe today you struggled to know that spiritual growth is possible for you maybe you feel like being like Jesus is not really in the cards for you maybe you're fearful that your best effort to grow spiritually won't be enough but trust God with that concern maybe you're further along in your spiritual growth than anyone else that you know there's more for you maybe you took a breather from spiritual effort and you haven't gotten back up or maybe you've settled into complacency and the Holy Spirit is nudging you today come on let's go we can grow we can keep growing we will grow God's not done with us yet today God is saying get ready I want you to keep growing because we aren't done here yet will you join with me as the worship team sings the song in praying yes God I will grow with you give me that growth Vision that growth mindset do what only you can do in me and in my church church and in my world and show me how to participate help us to get in shape to mature and to be your body like you've called us to be show us the way Holy Spirit at this time I'm going to invite you if you'd like someone to pray for you if you'd like to take a moment to seal this commitment to God like Deuteronomy says commit yourself firmly to God I'm going to ask you to come forward to the altar we're going to take some time to pray As we sing this song together [Music]", "good morning who's everybody that showed up like the service wave your hand these are my people I just wanted to identify my people um I am the associate pastor uh bringing greetings from every nation Church in Flint Michigan um I say that you are my people because I am the associate pastor and I have people that go oh well I can't be late because I showed up the same time Pastor Shannon did um so uh yeah so you are my people and I and I appreciate you I love you um and I will tell you it is so fun to be with you all my daughter has been with us on my husband is over here John if you could just wave [Applause] now he's an introvert and he feels like that's all I should ask of him today um so he's done for the rest the rest rest of service and probably the probably the rest of the day um my daughter Lara is somewhere hanging out with a new friend that she made of which she then told me she said um so when we coming back um because she's already decided that this is a good church these are good people and uh they give her good food so she's like oh yeah these are I can I can do this um so thank you thank you thank you so much for your hospitality um you all have just been wonderful and I so appreciate you but um I'm gonna tell you something I am I like this I like the energy here I like y'all loud y'all like me I like this um okay so we're gonna have some fun oh these are oh yeah this is my people okay so you know you're not supposed to have a favorite service but I think you're my favorite service um all right okay we about to do this thing okay so I I want to share a little something with you that I didn't share with the early service because it hit my heart um I told Pastor Jesse I said I'm probably gonna call it audible don't be don't be nervous um I tend to do that so I want to just share just just just briefly now this is not the sermon that I gave to the other service but I feel like I need to just say this a little bit right here um there's a wonderful story in the Bible about Hagar anybody heard of Hagar anybody familiar with that story at all I know some people know that story some people don't so I want to just make sure that you know we're all on the same page so Hagar is one of my favorite favorite people in the Bible it's one of my favorite people in the Bible because she's under look she's overlooked she's misunderstood and she is undervalued okay and so we talk about Justice oftentimes the people that are Seeking Justice are the people that have been overlooked misunderstood and undervalued now I know that y'all are perfect in here and that has never happened to you and everybody sees you and they roll out the red carpet every time you come in but I'm just telling my testimony if I could okay so I love Hagar for that now we're going to spend time in two chapters oh yeah we really are going here okay yep I'm really calling out audible now Pastor Jesse um if you could we're going to spend a little time in Genesis 16 and a little time in uh Genesis chapter 21. now earlier today I spoke a message on seeking the Peace of your city and that's because as I was praying and asking God what he wanted me to share with you he said I want them to seek the peace of their City because it's so important to seek the peace of your community but when I got ready to come into this service he said you need to tell them how much I love them so seek the peace but he wants to tell y'all how much he loves y'all so we're going that's why we shifting um so if you can go with me to your Bible to Genesis chapter 16. now I love the story of Hagar so much and it's because I'm black I know that I didn't know that I'm just going to share that a little bit with you and I have the Good Fortune of having been black for a little while now it's been something I've been doing for a minute so I feel really comfortable in it um so here's the thing there's something that you all whether you're black or not that you have seen black people do and we do it everywhere we go right right you've seen that you've seen that right okay that's the what up uh where I'm from in southeast Michigan that's what up though um that's how they say it in the Detroit um and from Flint and it's like hey what up what up and what's happening when we do that it's saying that I see you okay and I don't know now I'm gonna say this um are there any Latinas in the room any Latinas here okay all right Latinas tell me something these ain't the right shoes to be up here I'm supposed to have something about this high right my heels are not supposed to be on that's what I was told your heels are not supposed to be on the ground right so I'm totally out of Point yeah don't mind me I sprained my toe I'm gonna get back in the real heels um but my Latina sisters told me no no no no no no you ain't even supposed to be that low to the ground babies get up high get up high why and we do that now my Latina sisters y'all know y'all be wearing a mess out of some hoops right y'all can rock those Hoops like nobody's business I come from a generation a door knocker earrings y'all know that okay I'm telling my age we do the door knockers right okay um I'm gonna talk to uh my uh paler Caucasian sisters anybody got on the boots y'all know the boots I'm talking about we're that Christian we're that Christian Autumn girl at you know with the boots and she got a little best ah see I see them boots right there okay all right that's what we do that's what we do right okay now all right here's the thing and uh we got any Asian sisters in the room any Asian sisters in here okay but all right thank you thank you all right now my Asian seems to be doing some mess out of that eye makeup y'all be rocking that I can't do it but y'all know y'all been making that thing work why am I talking about this because in our communities we do things to be seen we do things to be seen and particularly in the black community um because I'm gonna speak from my experience we do this thing where if you walk into the room and you don't acknowledge the people in the room somebody go you don't see nobody in here you'll see me you don't see anybody in this space you better open your mouth when you speak now I know that you anybody have a grandmother Auntie or somebody that said that to you growing up you you better speak when you see okay here's the thing particularly for people of color particularly for I'm going to talk about those that may have grown up impoverished what happens is that Society overlooks you every day okay and so in certain communities what we've done is we've created our own places where we can make sure that we are acknowledged that our humanity is acknowledged right so when my grandmother would get ready for church and put on a full Hat full makeup where the shoes that match the skirt that match the dress what she was saying is you're gonna see me and you're gonna acknowledge my Humanity you're going to demonstrate that I have value because she grew up in Mississippi where black people were not valued where they were made to be invisible where if a white person walking down one side of the street they were told to cross on the other side okay now why is that important why do I love Hagar so much the title of this message and you'll see here because Hagar was seen too the title of this message is I see you Boo and God does too okay because it is important that you're seeing I read an article once it was in the LA Times and the article was written about a man's Journey as he was going to understand poverty from the American perspective and so when he went to Los Angeles he was United Nations Envoy and when he went there he said one of the things that he observed the most was not the poverty but what he called the violence of Turning Away because you see when you don't want to acknowledge someone's existence and you act like you don't see them that is really an act of violence it is violent to ignore the poor it is violent to ignore the unhoused it is violent to ignore gang bangers and those that are in need in our communities that is an act of violence it is an act of Cruelty because what you're really saying when I do like this you don't matter you don't have value and you're not of worth I'm so glad that that's not how God feels I'm so glad that that's not what God does when he looks at us so if you turn in your Bible to Genesis chapter 16 if you've got a Bible that's great if you got some kind of electronic device that's great and if you don't have anything that's okay because I'm gonna talk all the way through it so it won't matter um if you look in Genesis 16 what you're going to find is that Abraham has been given a promise and in that promise he was told he would be the father of many nations we always love to read in the Bible where God has given promises right we get so excited God has made a promise I'm going to do this for you then what happens that then God gets quiet and when God gets quiet behind a promise then we start calculating on our own how we are going to make the promise happen what am I going to need to do to make that happen God you said I could go to college but he's not given me any financial aid now what am I going to do instead of going back and saying okay God how do you want to solve my problem we start solving the problem on our own well God said I'm gonna go to college I don't have no money but if I do this little side hustle that'll make it work now the side hustle might get us locked up but we're gonna figure out our own way instead of waiting to let God provide an answer so that's what Abraham does he's like you said I'm gonna be a father of many nations Sarah you know that's my homegirl but she oh so I got to come up with a different way and Sarah because she wants to be in this equation she said I got a solution for you boo I got a Slave her name is Hagar y'all do what y'all got to do I'm not going to bother you and then that baby will be my baby now I want you to think about this for a second imagine Hagar she was supposed to be a free woman with choice a free woman who can make her own decisions live our own life but instead she has been pulled into slavery we would call that trafficking okay I say that I want to make this very clear because sometimes we don't always read the Bible as we read it sometimes as if it's something that's happening way far over here when everything that's in that book is designed for us to understand what's happening right now so we see a girl who's being trafficked okay and she's being trafficked not just traffic so she can clean and so she can cook and so she can do all the other work she's being trafficked to be a sex slave and after she gives birth to the baby it's not going to even be her own child it's going to be a child that she hasn't let somebody else raise and she'll work with that child she'll nurse that child she'll care for that child but she'll never be able to be acknowledged as the mother now I don't know about you but I call that Injustice now I want you to understand that even Christians can be unjust because we see Abraham who has received the promise Abraham who's got a covenant with God and now even with all that he knows and all that he knows God to be he's still going to make a choice to behave in an unjust way the question I post to you at this point in my message is what ways are you behaving unjustly even though you know God who is it that you are being that you're willing to mistreat in order to get your own promise where are you letting someone mistreat you for the hope of something better all right now so what happens Hagar has the baby and all of a sudden she's like oh I got some power up in this piece oh I got the baby now I know there's no baby mamas or baby daddies up in here but I'm just going to tell you because I'm from Flint how this works because see baby mama shows up at the house like um you uh I need my child support where you at um I can go to your mama's house and ask for stuff because I'm in charge of the baby okay I'm gonna do this because I've got a baby so that's what she does now y'all know how this works now you got Hagar and you have Sarah fighting right because they're fighting for what power what are they really fighting for significance who's gonna be on top who's going to run the house who's going to be in charge it is a trick of the enemy ladies to get us to think that in order to be seen we have to have a man to have significance now I want to be real clear about that that is a trick and that is a tool when you know how much God loves you when you realize how much he cares about you you won't need to use your body to get anyone's attention you will not let some slick talk in Joker treat you any kind of way because you'll remember that my worth and my value comes from the Lord and when you really know and trust God bruh you won't need to treat women any kind of way because you'll understand that this is the value that I am placing on a woman of God who is my sister in Christ [Applause] you do not want to perpetuate cycles of Injustice based on gender now so what happens to Hagar well Abraham's Hagar does I mean Sarah does what only she can do she goes to Abraham and says look at this woman look at what she's done look at how she's behaving and Abraham says to her what you want to do with her you in charge you're who I married and this is in verse 4. it says that Abraham slept with Hagar and she conceived when she knew she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress then Sarah said to Abram you are responsible for the wrong I am suffering I put my slave in your arms and now that she knows she's pregnant she despises me may the lord judge between you and me now it was her idea and now she's going to blame him for the choice that she encouraged him to make and then Abraham says your slave is in your hands do whatever you think is best for her so she did what she thought was best she started mistreating her you gonna wash these floors with a toothbrush you gonna start making bricks with no straw and so Hagar does with anybody who's being treated unjustly does it says so she fled because when you're being oppressed that's what you do you want to run you look for a way of Escape nobody wakes up in the morning saying I wonder how best I can be mistreated today I wonder what's the ways that someone can take away my power my humanity and all the things that make me feel of value so she ran away here's the thing when you belong to God it doesn't matter how far you run God will always be wherever you are and he will find you there he finds you there because he's always got his eye on you he always wants to know how you were doing he's always going to care about you and so the angel Lord found Hagar and he said um where where did you come from and uh where do you plan on going because he knew in order to help her understand what's going on he had to help her understand where she was where are you on your journey with God where are you you need to get your bearings you can't just flee from a difficult situation Pastor Kurt explain to you all that I'm from Flint born and raised a city that at one point had the strange designation of being the murder capital of the U.S I grew up during the time in the late 80s early 90s where gun violence was rampant um people shooting up stuff all the time I would say mom I want to go to this concert she said who's going to be at the concert who's going to be at the party and I would say everybody and she said no I don't need you with everybody why don't you stay home and so there was a lot of stuff I didn't get a chance to do and so my biggest goal growing up in Flint was figuring how I was going to get out of Flint because I was trying to flee a place where I was oppressed I wanted to go someplace just do something else be anyplace else but in Flint now as you heard Pastor crochet I'm from Flint let me tell you how well that went for me not only did I stay in Flint my entire life I was only able to leave about a year and a half ago because God had a purpose and a plan for me being there that even if it was a place where there was Injustice I was called to address the Injustice there I was called to speak to it to deal with it to live with it to handle it to be a source of light in that place now some of you may also have that assignment here in Lynn I want to encourage you don't be like Hagar Don't just run away because it's hard because it's difficult because they're not talking about you nicely because they're not treating you lightly because you know I bet you I could do something better someplace else the safest place you will ever be is in the perfect will of God so what does Hagar say to the angel when he says what are you doing why are you here she goes I'm running that's why I'm here and you know that you've had that conversation with someone hey what are you doing oh those people are horrible that's why I left that job those people are crazy that's why I left that school that's why I dropped out because those people were mistreating me that's why I left that marriage because that man was crazy that woman was getting on my nerves we've run we flee difficult situations but here's what the Lord encourages her to do he says go back and not only does he tell her to go back but then he says and submit now I don't know about y'all I might have gone back I might have gone back but I wouldn't have been submitting I'd have been telling them y'all get ready for the orange jumpsuit because I ain't submitting I'm going back with a brick of battle so I'm going I'm not going back that other way but that wouldn't have been God that would have been my flesh that would have been something on the inside of me saying yeah this is so this is what I want to do you see when you're going to address Injustice you can't do it your way everybody's like oh I want to do this so I'm going to go riot is that what God told you to do now I'm not saying he may not tell he maybe tell you to write it he may tell you to go in but you need to check first you can't just go in your own flesh decide that you learn how to solve the problem you need to find out what is God requiring of Me In This Moment and what Gobbler's crying of Hagar was to go back and to submit sometimes your greatest witness will be your behavior in a difficult situation there are so many people that have never seen what it looks like to interact with a genuine Christian they don't know what it's like to look with to deal with someone who is kind who is forgiving Who Walks In Love who walks in long suffering who exudes forgiveness and kindness it's so much easier to point the finger at someone and go I'm going to be mean to you because of what you did to me and if anybody had the right to demand Justice it would have been Hagar if anybody had a right to come back and say you are wrong and you owe me it would have been her but God said that's not my way for you and oftentimes we'll look at other people and say but so and so did it they went off they said what they had to say they got off their chest why don't I because God is calling you to something different and oftentimes the higher the God is trying to take you the more he will cause you to descend because he wants to understand can you be humble before he elevates you so what does the angel do he said yes you're going to go back you're going to submit but and he makes her a promise I will increase your descendants so much they will be too numerous to count we call this in seminary an abrahamic promise a patriarchal promise what does that mean there are very few people in Scripture that said I will make your children more numerous than the sand Hagar was the only woman during that period of time that has ever received that promise sometimes when God promises you freedom there's a path he will take where you will go through a place of Injustice not because he doesn't want to get you to freedom because there are things he's working on you in the process the way he's changing your heart changing your perspective causing you to think and function differently currently I am the president and CEO of the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation I manage an organization that has over 200 million dollars of assets under management that I direct and guide now I'm not saying that for y'all to clap or think anything exciting I'm saying it for this reason I can't tell you the number of times that people dog me out in a given day I can't tell you the number of times that people look at me and go well I don't know why you got there what's her qualifications we don't need a preacher up there we need somebody with a financial Financial background I don't know the first thing about accounting we need somebody who's got deep investment experience I don't know first thing about investment but here's what I do know I know how to not get ruffled when people call me out my name I know how to not be bothered just because people aren't treating me right I know how to sleep easy at night even when ever been called Everything But A Child of God I know how to treat my employees with kindness I know how to not look at people that are in my community that need our services and treat them like oh that's them and keep them at arm's length I know how to move with compassion and empathy and that's what God wanted in that role it was less about my skill set and more about my heart and my values because see there are people in those positions And when they see people that are in need they're like I don't even want to be around folks like that I didn't want to deal with people like that we need more leaders who have been tested who've been tried and know how to walk in love and not want to do what my mom would call play to get backs you may recall one of my favorite stories is Joseph and I'll just mention this point briefly Joseph when he was finally elevated to his place with Pharaoh had an opportunity to get back at his brothers right to mistreat them for all the wrong that they had done had done to him when you have been part of an oppressed or a marginalized Community you have to make sure that you want Justice and not Revenge because revenge is easy Justice is harder because see hmm I know what it's like to want revenge to want to get back at the people that talked about you said what you would not be talk about what you could not accomplish but I kept holding on to the fact that God saw me and if God cared about me it didn't matter what anybody else thought my grandmother always just say you'll need everybody to like you you don't need everybody to speak well are you you just need the right people to speak well at you you just need God to like you because when God likes you he'll open up every door and he doesn't care who he has to move out of the way when God likes you it doesn't matter who's done you wrong it doesn't matter who's mistreated you it doesn't matter none of that matters now here's the thing and this is what I love about this the angel begins to give her that promise and in verse 13 she does something extraordinary she says here she gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her you are the God who sees me for she said I have now seen the one who sees me and that's why the well was called beer lahaira and it is still there between Kardashian beret she does something amazing she stops and she says oh my goodness you found me in the desert place you found me in my dry place you found me in my place of Injustice you have found me when I'm at my lowest and you called me by my name you saw my potential and you gave me a promise when you grow up in places like Flint people want to write you off they will say I don't know about that because they assume that everything in that Community is nothing but disadvantages what they don't know my advantages were being part of a community that loved me and nurtured me being part of a church family that cared and put their arms around me and that what I was learning was a level of compassion and kindness that most people who don't live in communities like that never experience and so Hagar does the unthinkable The Impossible she names God now I don't know what name you've given to God in your circumstance have you named him the god who's forgotten about me have you named him the god that doesn't care have you named him the god who doesn't focus on me or have you named God as a God who sees me because I want you to understand he sees every single one of you he sees the city of Lynn he sees this church and he has a promise to each one of you and he has a promise to this church and he has a promise to this community you see just like we desire to be acknowledged God desires to acknowledge us but you have to be willing to pause you have to be willing to let God come and find you and when he finds you you have to be willing to not reject him you see sometimes you can be in that desert place so long that you forget how to acknowledge God because bitterness will take root in your heart because of all of the Injustice that you've experienced that you have seen but Hagar knew enough to say you know what if you're willing to come out if you're willing to seek me out if you're willing to look for me that means you still care and if you still care I have hope and I can get through whatever it is that I am dealing with so what we find if we go forward to uh oh come on I'm gonna need some new technology I told my husband about that I said oh we I think we're gonna have to do better um so what happens is that after Ishmael is born Sarah again after Hagar returns sends her away again and in verse 10 of chapter 21 she said to Abraham get rid of that slave woman and her son for that son will never share in The Inheritance with my son Isaacs you see by now Sarah has finally believed God she's given birth to a child but she doesn't want them connected what Sarah didn't understand what that Isaac and Ishmael had linked Fates because they share the same father oftentimes in communities like this you find people in various suburbs around us that don't understand that you're connected back to this community and so they're like we don't have to care we can write it off Abraham was so distressed because he did care genuinely about what happened to Ishmael but God said to him don't be distressed I will make a son of the slave a nation also just because he belongs to you and if you go a little bit further on into verse 17. Sarah has decided that they're Hagar outside they're in the wilderness and they're just going to die there nothing good is going to happen she sends them away to get a little something to eat so that she can cry by herself because she's feeling forsaken even though she had a promise she can't remember it because of all the oppression she's experiencing in that moment when I was pregnant with my daughter I was sick and I wasn't just kind of sick I was really sick now I believe God for a child for a very long time I didn't know that when I was experiencing the promise how thick the promise was going to make me I was sick from sun up to sundown to the point where they were like we're going to have to put a port in your neck to get you fluids because I was constantly dehydrated from all of the wretching that was going on and most people begin to lose weight and they even have kidney failure and sometimes they will die they said I had a condition that basically made me allergic to being pregnant and a lot of people in that situation will terminate the pregnancy because you're choosing between the life of your child and your own life God may have made you a promise that he's trying to fulfill but in the middle of it you may be so sick you're like I don't even know if I want it anymore I may be so challenged by I don't know if I want to deal with it anymore after I delivered my baby I developed congestive heart failure they brought my husband into the room I was in the emergency room after delivering her it was about a week later my blood pressure began to go up it was 180 over 90. than 190 over 90 then 200 over 90. when it got to be 200 over 90 my husband just dropped his head and I knew something horrible was about to happen and I talked to God and I said God what's about to happen he said I don't know what you want to happen because God and I had that kind of conversation even in emergency rooms and he's like your mother has deceased and you miss her so much you could die and go to heaven and I would be okay and you'd be with your mother forever or you can choose to stay with your child it's up to you now I love my husband but I was like Lord that child gonna need a black mama I need you to help me stay he's not gonna know how to do her hair it's gonna be rough I'm gonna need to stick around a little bit longer and the Lord blessed me and he healed me and to this day I can tell you I don't take any heart medication the doctors and the cardiologists declared me healed and hold [Music] [Applause] I say that because in that moment I know how Hagar felt where she was like let us just die let us just go away and what happens there is that in verse 19 God opens up her eyes he says Don't Be Afraid she looks she opens up her eyes and she sees a well and she went and she gave the boy some water to drink just when she thought they were going to die just when she thought it was all over God opens up your eyes I don't know where you're at and I don't know what you need to see but if you are willing to let God open up your spiritual eyes he will show you the well that is right in front of you that he wants to bless you from it doesn't matter how difficult the situation is there's always a well and God is always seeing you and wanting to protect you but not just you he wants to protect your dream you see Ishmael although she had been trafficked although it been difficult Ishmael was a fulfillment of a dream for her because she had won her the whole time will my life ever matter or will I just be identified as someone who was trafficked will this ever be of anything will I ever have relationship will I ever have a future will I ever have a hope and in that moment God was like you will always have a hope I will always see you I am always caring about you no matter how difficult it is no matter how forsaken you I am with you and so I say to you today East Coast International Church God sees you he sees you right where you are and he loves you deeply and he cares for you tremendously you are not Forsaken and you are not overlooked amen amen let's go stand up [Applause] so if you are here today and you have felt isolated overlooked you feel like God is not with you where you are you feel like God has forsaken you I want to invite you to come to the altar here we're going to make an altar in front of this platform and the pastors of this church they're going to pray for you now some of you may be like I don't want to come up there that's just too much I get that but even Hagar had to acknowledge God in some way thank you take a moment just to acknowledge God and I can assure you that God will acknowledge you in return [Music] so I'm going to invite you to come up [Music] no matter how invisible you may have been to the people around you they may not even know the burden that you're carrying they may not know the difficulty that you have faced but God knows he knows your heart he knows your situation he sees you and he cares deeply about you if you're in your seat I'm going to ask that you pray for this community and for the people that are at the altar because God has blessed you to be in a place where you have the strength to do that and ask that you come now I'm going to lead us in a prayer now I don't know what time y'all get out so if you need to leave to go to work okay then please do what you need to do okay all right so I'm gonna pray the worship team will be playing behind me and then we'll sing and lead us in a time at the altar okay and again if you need to leave if you diabetic and you got to go take your insulin look God is a very understanding God I'm not going to ask you to close your eyes you may want to look around I always looked around at all I was like what are they doing up there I want to see I'm from Flint something could be going on I need to keep my eyes open whatever it is that you need to do do okay but know that we're creating a place for you to meet with God here amen gonna lead us in prayer God you care who care about the broken you care about the Forgotten you care about those that are overlooked care about people that have been hurt through no fault of their own you care about those of us that were born into circumstances that we had no control over who are saying God where are you in the midst of my pain where are you as

you haven't been part of this series so far and you'd like to catch up you can go back on our YouTube page and you like like it and whatever you're supposed to do with those buttons okay you can uh subscribe and stuff right so so you can catch that so but tearing down strongholds in our life requires us not just to tear them down but it requires us to keep them down once they get down Amen in order to make sure that we never let them um come back up or to make sure that we never let strongholds be established in our life to begin with this is really important and so we're we're working on as we've talked about a lot it is my heart's deepest desire that you live full abundant and free lives all the days of your lifeall and so that's why we spend a lot of time on this there is this false narrative that seems to live inside our brains and here's the narrative it is that everything in life is supposed to be easy and beautiful that Instagram pictures are real that unicorns are just around the corner that money will magically appear when you get older and retire even if you don't invest right now sorry to pop your bubble people are just walking around in The Matrix ignorant to the clear and obvious spiritual realities that are all around them yet there are spiritual realities that remain that are real that remain unseen and unacknowledged many people are just speak feeding through life just one pothole away from the wheels of their life coming off and they are oblivious and entirely unprepared help us here's what happens if you walk into a fight without knowing that you are walking into a fight you will lose that fight because you are unprepared because you will be ambushed it doesn't matter how clever you are how smart you are how wealthy you are how many Facebook friends you have how many followers you have how many likes and comments you get when you allow yourself to be lulled into a place of complacency or apathy or untouchability it's in that moment that you have allowed yourself to be set up for the Sucker Punch of a life that can take you down or take you out amen so listen listen to the words of Jesus because that's what we do around here we listen to the words of Jesus Jesus said this in John chapter 16 I I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me here on Earth you will have many trials and Sorrows how many trials and Sorrows many Merry Christmas but take heart because I have overcome the world the take Heart part is not oh you won't really have them it's that no you will have them that I have overcome in other words expect obstacles in your life expect the enemy to put some obstacles in your path prepare yourself for the realities of mountains appearing in front of you you will have mountains maybe it'll be a mountain of your thoughts a mountain of debt a mountain of addiction a mountain of a failing marriage a mountain of rebellious children a mountain of a mess that you got your own self into what do you do what do you do about that what do you do about those m well I'm happy you asked first thing you do is you need to get Battle ready tell your neighbor get battle ready get battle ready get battle ready see getting battle ready is a little different than just getting ready you got to get get battle ready see I don't know if you noticed but there was this thing called the Olympics that just happened and the Olympics were pretty cool and they they just concluded it's always amazing to see the athletes to realize just how much training and preparation it takes to become a Gold Medal winner you ever watch the Olympics and you're looking at those Runners you're like you're just flexing you're say I could I could do that I I could do that you're like delusional you know you're thinking you could do that you're watching him man it's amazing they get faster every year they get stronger every year you're like I'm wonder I I really I think this I think I wonder if I could do that I wonder if I I wonder what it would take for me to do that and I I contemplate it and I watch it and I I'm getting inspired as I eat the potato chips out of the bowl on the couch with my seat you know with with the and then then if I get really inspired I might get up I might stand up might put the reclin her down and I stand up I stretch a little you you know like stretching a little bit but as I get up I get like a standing up injury like I literally just got like a stretching injury right there just as I was doing that I I don't know if you get those standing up injuries or waking up in the morning injuries or going to bed injuries like once you get past like 26 that starts to happen Okay 30 every day deade it gets worse anyhow anyhow so come get back get back here come on come on so I started to research I said I wonder what it would take and I read this that the Olympic athletes the good ones train 32 hours a week for eight years or more wow I mean it's 10 to 13,000 hours of training and and that's not the hard part and they eat very specific foods like no potato chips are involved okay they eat very specific foods and they keep a constant level of a certain level of hydration wow that's kind of impressive honestly that's impressive I'm really impressed by that and I think is there any hope is there any hope for someone like me to ever make it to the Olympics and then this guy happens you know what I'm talking about then this guy happens like maybe maybe there's hope maybe there's hope but no no no not really because this guy actually has been shooting his whole life but then this lady happens and you're like oh there's hope there's hope maybe there's really hope right she's doing a kangaroo you know so okay you're like There's Hope listen I don't know where you stand on the Australian break dancing lady but all I got to say is this 2028 LA's coming we're all going to the Olympics we're all going okay right so all right apparently you don't have to prepare anymore okay so the point is this there is a clear difference in the Olympics between the people that have been given the opportunity to train full-time for a decade and those that don't prepare quite as much okay preparation is the key especially when you're going into battle when I talked to Young pastors who are asking at this point for advice they're like what what what's the advice you would give me I say the same thing now over and over again I say you're in a war act accordingly you're in a war act accordingly get physically emotionally socially financially and spiritually prepared for battle because you're in a battle preparation is the primary difference between those that overcome in those that do not if you don't prepare you will not overcome in modern day Turkey there sits the ruins of one of the Ancient Wonders of the World in what we call Ephesus and my wife and I were there this past summer and or last summer and this was one of the most important cities in the ancient Mediterranean world and one of the first churches in the world was established there in that City and it was started by a man named Paul who at one point Time Magazine listed as the number one most influential person in history after Paul left Ephesus after he had started the church after he left Ephesus he was put into prison and he was regularly thinking about Ephesus and he was regularly writing to the new pastor whose name was Timothy and he was writing to the church and if you've ever wanted a shortcut to kind of understanding the Bible let me give it to you real quick uh the more you understand the people the politics and the religious systems of six places the more you'll understand the what they were dealing with Egypt Palestine Jerusalem Rome Corinth and Ephesus if you understand those things you'll understand the context of what Jesus and his followers were dealing with so Paul is writing a letter it's really a sermon but it's in written form it's like a first century YouTube video that has more views than Mr Beast will ever have so he writes this fairly intense sermon it's called Ephesians and in conclusion he says this it's his remember it's it's like his final words it's to his most treasured of friends and it's his children his spiritual children he loves these people he loves these people with a unique fear fierceness that you can catch in the language of Ephesians he really wants to make sure they get it and so at the very end of his sermon in Ephesians chapter 6 we're going to read it from the message a paraphrase he says it this way and that about wraps it up God is strong and he wants you strong so take everything the master has set out for you well-made weapons of the best materials and put them to use so you will be able to stand up to everything the devil throws your way this is no afternoon athletic contest that we'll walk away from and forget about in a couple hours this is for Keeps a life or death fight to the Finish against the devil and All His angels Paul is reminding us that life is not a game it's not a sport it's life and death and there's a real devil in real fallen angels and they are throwing everything that can at you so Paul's reminding us use the weapons God gives you because God's weapons are different than human weapons Paul continues he says be prepared you're up against far more than you can handle on your own take all the help you can get every weapon God has issued so that when it's all over but the shouting you'll still be on your feet truth righteousness peace faith and salvation are more than words learn how to apply them you'll need them throughout your life God's word is an indispensable weapon so Paul's saying be prepared okay be prepared now in in the translations of the Bible uh uh you'll really see that it's called the armor of God and you'll see putting on the full armor of God okay and uh when you're like in Sunday school or when you're in kids church or there's this thing that they they have your like you'll put on like little costumes and they'll learn the whole armor of God like like a Roman soldier and you'll you'll put on the belt of truth and the breastplate of righteousness and the feet of peace and the The Shield of faith and the the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is God's word okay and you'll have this you have this like imagery in your head and this is great you put on the whole armor of God and that's really important well there's two pieces missing two pieces missing but they seldom get talked about two pieces of the armor of God that are that understated in the graphs uh and it's because in the illustration that Paul's making Paul essentially runs out of runs out of pieces of the uniform to keep making his point but it keeps on going verse he KS and he says in the same way here's the rest of the armor in the same way prayer is essential in the ongoing Warfare pray hard and long pray for your brothers and sisters keep your eyes open keep each other's spirits up so that no one falls behind or drops out okay so there's two more we there's two more weapons first one is prayer listen because power comes through prayer it's really simple everybody no prayer no power amen if you want to live a spiritually powerful and overcoming life pray if you want to live a powerless struggling impotent fruitless life don't pray so pray that's another weapon and then the final one is each other each other say it out loud each other each other see there's not supposed to be any Rogue soldiers in God's Army amen if you're out there like doing it Rogue you're doing it wrong you're literally doing it wrong so wrong that you might be in the wrong Army because everybody need somebody because somebody needs to have your back and you you need to have somebody else's back because the devil is gunning for you 24/7 365 because we all have blind spots and you got to have other people that can see your blind spots call it out and have your back you got to let other people see your blind spots and call them out on you Ecclesiastes says two people are better off than one they can help each other succeed if one person person falls the other can reach out and help but if but someone who falls alone is in real trouble you know what the Assumption of this is the assumption is you will fall you get that all right the Assumption of scripture throughout the entire thing is you're going to fall you're going to mess up you're going to have some blind spots and you need other people to pick you back up you go Rogue you stay down you need each other these are all the weapons Hallelujah so first point here is get battle ready tell your neighbor get battle ready get battle ready the second one is posture yourself to fight okay posture yourself to fight okay what does that mean you see you can get ready and then go to sleep and that's not going to help you you got to posture yourself to fight you got to get ready to fight you got to put your head on swivel you got to be ready fight like you've never fought before you understand friends we're talking spiritually we're not talking street fighting some of you got too excited when a mountain is dropped in your life you've have to make a choice you can whine about the mountain on or you can go up to the mountain and say Mountain be removed in Jesus name but if that mountain ignores you you say to yourself self this Mountain don't know who it's messing with you go up to that mountain and you start to climb that mountain and climbing that mountain can be hard it can be difficult and sometimes you want to turn around and sometimes you want to give up and sometimes you want to say it's too hard and sometimes you want to make a deal with the mountain mountain you stay here and I'll go over there but listen don't do it right tell your neighbor don't do it don't do it if you give in the mountain then from that day on the mountain owns you amen right don't let the mountain own you years ago I used to climb Mount madok every single year on Thanksgiving morning I was trying to earn my turkey right I was trying to earn it every Thanksgiving morning then I then I realized early one Thanksgiving morning I was out of shape and so I didn't do it and the mountain beat me and the next year I was in worse shape so I didn't go and the year after that I was in even worse shape next thing you know nine years go by the mountain had defeated me in so many different ways now what I should have done is I should have used the mountain mocking me as an indicator that it was time to fight yeah but instead I delayed and a decade went by and do you know what happens when you delay delay almost always leads to defeat because delay means you're not fighting I will get it later no you won't I will do it tomorrow nope next time I'll give it a shot not going to happen right that's not how it works we all know it unless you have a come to Jesus moment come on now thank God thank God I had to come to Jesus moment yes and I said to myself and Jesus say one year from now I'm going to conquer that mountain so I trained prepared for a year went to the bottom of that mountain stood by myself and said that stupid Mountain no more I looked around first made sure no one was looking you're no longer going to mock me it's time for your Reign Over My Life to end and I climbed it and then I climbed Mount Washington the highest mountain in New England and then I climbed with Lou my 48 tallest mountains in New Hampshire now sometimes you got to dig deep but friends in this life you will have many troubles trials disappointments mountains but know this in the end if you have Jesus no matter what the trials tribulations and challenges are if you have Jesus in the end you win no matter what yes because of Jesus you have already won because of Jesus we can have peace and confidence he told us that while we are here on Earth we are going to have trouble because trouble is inevitable we live in a broken chaotic and Fallen World we're going to have tribulation and trials and things are going to come against us but if you are battle ready prepared and post to fight then you can resist and you can resist successfully James 4:7 says some so humble yourselves before God resist the devil and he will flee from you that's what it says resist be battle ready posture yourselves to fight resist the devil we're not done with those mountains yet sometimes mountains in our life are just overwhelming challenges and other times they are disguised opportunities of a lifetime come on now years ago there was an organization in Montana that wanted to get rid of all the whole bunch of wolves and they they put a bounty out of $5,000 for every wolf captured alive and there were two Hunters Named Sam and Jed decided to head for the mountains to make some money capturing Wolves day and night they scoured the mountains and Forest searching for their valuable prey exhausted after 3 days of hunting without any success they both fell asleep on night during the night Sam suddenly woke up to find that he and Jed were surrounded by a pack of 50 wolves flaming red eyes and bare teeth snarling at the two Hunters preparing to eat them Sam nudged Jed and said hey wake up we're GNA be rich we're going to be rich sometimes when we are surrounded by what appears to be many difficulties we may be in fact surrounded by great opportunity when a crisis occurs we can choose to be frightened angry and cowardly or strong and courageous sometimes it's literally a matter of perspective and preparation so next time you find yourself surrounded by those wolves remember you're going to be Rich see maybe you have an opportunity to learn and grow and to experience the grace and power of God in that situation situations like that don't come along every day you know some people get in a situation and they think things couldn't get any worse and they start to complain about other things and all the stuff they're going through and it starts to sound like a bad country song and you can experience bad things and certainly bad things will come your way but God has a way if you if you've had any experience with God God has a way of turning your test into a testimony and your bad country song can turn into a praise worship and gospel Victory song just like that and sometimes mountains in your life will be disobedient on and sometimes those mountains will be difficult to deal with and I want you to remind yourself that no matter what if you have Jesus in the end you have Victory yes and when that mountain decides it wants to Mock You remind that mountain you already have the Victory and when that mountain starts to kick your butt start to fight like you have never fought before and if it doesn't want to leave if he doesn't want to leave climb up on top of it and do a little victory dance on top of it and if you tell it to go throw itself in the ocean and it doesn't listen look your mountain in the eye and say oh no you didn't and you go up and you grab a rock off the top of that mountain and you start to throw those pieces into the sea and if it starts to fight back fight like you mean it no gloves break out the spiritual chains bat and crowbar why is this the correct response why because Jesus said I tell you the truth you can say to this mountain may you be be lifted up and thrown into the sea and it will happen but you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart and I tell you that mountain will test you it is being disobedient and it needs to be taught a lesson so pray rehearse the scriptures step out and Faith tell your testimony and you got to praise God on top of that mountain because every time you go to your mountain or mountains and you praise God on top of it and over it it causes a spiritual earthquake to occur and if you've ever been in a fight or situation and you're like fighting for your spiritual life listen and you turn around and the people that were supposed to have your back have disappeared when you turned around listen you got to do a friend check amen one you got to make sure you're not fighting this thing alone and two you got to make sure that the people around you are going to stay in the fight with you make sure that you ain't got no punk that's scared you got to you got to make sure they're not going to go running off off I want you to look to your neighbor and say you got some fight in you okay I you know the right kind of fight okay the right kind of fight right kind of fight here's the kind of Fight You need to have in you you got to have a fight to change the way that you think fight to get out of debt and fight to overcome that addiction and fight to restore your marriage and fight to keep your kids and fight to get out the hell that you got yourself in you got to have friends that will fight and get it absolutely all the time all the time and I want you to get this that's what a church is for if you ever wondered what in the world is church for is to have people that will be your backup to get in a fight together but you know you can do Church wrong you can this is how you do Church wrong I love you in advance okay all right so y though I walked through the body of shadow of death sorry the uh no I'm teasing teasing you can come to church every week sneak in sneak out and not know anybody never invest into relationships never find people that will fight with you and for you am never fight for people and it it's just a religious exercise and you miss it this is not a statement of condemnation this is a statement of please don't miss it you got mountains to fight you got to have backup yes you do you need backup you can't do it on your own if you're out there doing it on your own you're not as successful as you think you are the worship team comes up to rescue [Applause] me then my back up when the mountain says you can't do it you got to get some shout in you and say I am going to make it I am going to make it and if you don't believe it if you don't believe it and you're just going through the motions of those words get some backup get some backup that will help you believe it say so we're going to say it together you're going to make it tell your neighbor you're going to make it you're going to make it say it again you're going to make it tell them again you're going to make it tell them again you're going to make it Hallelujah see when you got friends are your backup to help you make it it's a whole different it's a whole different battle that mountain goes from this to this you see with Jesus you're about to break through with Jesus you're about to start to walk in the authority of Jesus it's time to start wearing those big boys those spiritual big boy pants Jesus it's it's time to start taking this thing back so listen get battle ready posture yourself to fight and watch those mountains start turning into Miracles come on now amen would you stand with [Music] me there were no allergies in here today thank God you had to be here the last three weeks it's okay you ever seen geese flying and they they when they're flying in groups they always go in this v-shaped formation that first Goose if you don't know it that first Goose takes the biggest hit that's right it has to expend the most energy and it it flaps the hardest so that the next in line can take it a little easier and the one after them can take a little easier and the one after them can take a little easier all the way to the back the back row geese are just like chilling back there taking it really easy it's like they're on vacation amen when the front Goose eventually gets too tired they shift position and they go back so they can take a break and they all have each other's back as they're flying that's what we're talking about make sure you have each other's back because you need help you need help to fight the wind that's coming against you you need help to climb the mountains in front of you you need help help to throw that mountain into the sea you need help to get on top of that mountain and praise God over it and you need help to fight like you've never fought before yes the worship team was going to lead us in this why don't we do some some battling today why don't we do some battling today keeping those strongholds down help each other as we praise today the altars are open let's let go ahead and let the worship team lead us thank you Jesus", "[Music] hey friends welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting you're listening to pastor dave and we're in the middle of this series called you will receive power and today is day three and today's topic is about the source the source i want to ask you a question to begin this conversation and it is what is your power source hopefully this illustration will help so i recently had to switch from a fuel operated lawn mower to a battery operated lawnmower and you know it's a different kind of power it's a different source before i had to go to the gas station you know fill up the gas tank take it back and fill up the lawnmower but you know with this new system this new source i have to charge this battery it's a lithium battery it is a great grey lawnmower and it's so smooth and you know there's less effort involved on my part it is so good but the idea that it's a different source i want you to think about that when it comes to the source of your power the source of your strength uh what you draw upon in moments of difficulty and chaos and here's a principle that i want us to focus on today as we get ready to pray to do the work of god we need the power of god i'll say that again to do the work of god we need the power of god think about it for a moment if the life that we are called to as believers by god is supernatural then the ability that we need is supernatural we need a supernatural source and you know it as well as i do that often it's tempting to do the work of god in our own power it's just our default it's what we fall back on when life gets difficult when we are going into unchartered territory we fall back on what we know but what does that take us where does that take us where does that lead us to well look no further than the life of peter when we look at the life of simon peter you know he became one of the greatest leaders of all time in the new testament a leader of the church just a powerful presence but if we look at peter's life before jesus was crucified in fact leading up to his crucifixion we find a different peter we find a peter who is relying on his own strength to get the job done to do the work of god has that ever happened to you and look at peter we find a peter that is impulsive quick tempered he's focused on self-preservation he's violent at one point he cuts off another man's ear he ends up denying jesus three times his intention is good he's trying to follow jesus but he's doing it in his own strength in his own power now fast forward a few pages we get to the book of acts we see the holy spirit being poured out on all believers and then we find peter the same guy who is now relying on the power of god and what do we see we see him bringing healing to the sick boldly stepping out sharing the good news sharing the message of jesus with others and bringing freedom to those in bondage now what was the difference what changed what shifted well acts 1 8 remember jesus had promised his followers you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea in samaria and to the ends of the earth so when you think about it prayer is really an act of humility because it forces us to come to terms with our own limitations when we are able to take inventory of our own lives our families our communities we see the brokenness in all of these areas the task of us bringing healing can seem a bit daunting like it becomes abundantly clear that we need supernatural power from a supernatural god if we're going to get the job done and this is what jesus promises he promises power you will receive power and the original word that would power is dunamis you're going to receive miracle working power jesus promises that the holy spirit will enable us to do the mighty works of god think about that sounds amazing would you join me let's pray that god would empower us and equip us for the task at hand heavenly father today we come to you knowing that you've called us to do a great work but god we're so thankful that you don't expect us to do this work in our own strength our own ability god you've promised us supernatural power you've promised to be our source of supernatural strength and we hold on to that promise god we need you today there's so many things that we are trying to accomplish so many things you've pointed out that need to be repaired that need to be mended [Music] that you've called us to partner with you in bringing healing and restoration to this world but god we can't do that alone and god we apologize for so many times where we've stepped out in our own ability and we've fallen short other times we've fallen straight out flat on our faces because we can't do this work alone and god today we want to declare that you are our source of power you are our source of strength you are our source of supernatural ability that help us to step out and do the work that you've called us to do our calling our assignment that help us to persevere help us to overcome adversity discouragement loneliness help us to rise above the challenges to come out stronger and with a greater sense of your faithfulness god we pray today that you would show up in mighty power in every situation and over every individual that is listening to this where here god we're available have your way let your will be done in jesus name we pray amen thank you so much for joining me today i'm gonna leave the music playing and continue to pray as you feel led to god bless you and hopefully we get a chance to connect tomorrow as well [Music] more [Music] you", "12.31.19 \nGeneral Notes - Pastor Joshua \n\u2022

a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it [Music] hello everyone hi guys happy i feel like i can't say happy but i want you guys to have a good day so it's black saturday um it is black saturday this is our final holy week podcast episode yeah sad wow it is kind of sad yeah um this has been a really cool experience for me i've really enjoyed i just have to say i've really enjoyed doing this with you christina and also doing it with you guys who are listening and just having the opportunity to slow down a little bit on hollyweek and be more intentional and more contemplative about what it is that we're celebrating this week i feel like it's enriched my experience this year yeah so i i hope it has for you guys as well um tomorrow is easter sunday as i'm sure everyone knows easter sunday probably the most well attended sunday service in the world and hopefully we'll see you guys in church yeah see you guys there but today is kind of this strange limbo day in the midst of holy week yeah jesus is jesus is uh unavailable right now and so we can't really um talk to you about what he's saying or doing or yeah we were to track jesus steps like they just they're just stop stationary right now i'm not really sure what jesus is doing yeah yeah who knows what he's doing certainly his body is not doing much right but that doesn't mean jesus isn't doing anything right jesus is probably very busy today yeah there's a few different like theories about what jesus might be doing but it seems to me as though we don't have any super solid biblical right uh narrative about today so i don't want to like necessarily necessarily get into these you know like what's theoretical yeah i read an article about whether or not he was wrestling like satan for like yeah for the keys that's awesome and i know because i think i remember hearing that as a kid and i just really enjoyed that imagery i like literally when i think about it i see jesus like going down and like knocking on hell's door and be like i'm here to get the keys just like oh no it's he's a lot cooler than that that sounded so well that's what i think it's like what do you think amazing like pyrotechnics and rock and roll is he like each step like here he is you hear like the guitar solos in the back like jesus there's some kind of announcer there's some angels some like powerful cherubim and separate what are those names separate their wings are like blowing like yeah this is definitely what i imagined as a child like i just was like i just saw a conversation happening like very chill very laid back wow and that's our personality in a nutshell please there's your personality test where do you see jesus yeah how do you imagine jesus yeah um but we don't actually know and i um as i was reading that article i was kind of like convicted because it was like yeah so satan has never owned the keys to hell to begin with so why are we thinking that jesus had to fight him for it and so i was like oh snap that's true yeah so yeah so we don't really know what jesus is doing today so i guess that's pretty much the whole episode thank you for joining all right just kidding okay wow i think we're a little bit too cheesy sorry guys all right so today i thought it would be an interesting thought experiment to explore through dialogue together what would it be like if good friday was the end of the jesus story like imagine perhaps okay i don't know if this is gonna like come back to bite me in a few years and somebody's gonna be like this woman's a heretic but like obviously this is not true right but just imagine like if jesus died on the cross and then never had a bodily resurrection never came back to life but just like went it just kind of continued to be god like it continued to exist in his in spirit but like one went back to heaven but didn't show up as jesus to his disciples again like yeah didn't burst out of the tomb yeah craziness exactly wow i never like like clarified things for people or whatever like just think about that like what do you think the repercussions would be that would be so anti-climactic yeah like well yeah it'd be very tragic yeah i just so i don't know what state the disciples were like they kind of seem to have forgotten that he said he would raise again in three days yes um and i just don't know like where they're at like would they begin to question if any of it was legitimate um would they lose their faith or would they still kind of try to preach the message of of jesus but then also like the infilling of the holy spirit after jesus did eventually ascend into heaven was crucial to them being able to handle spreading the gospel message like without the feeling of the holy spirit they could not have done it on their own and so so i think i feel like it would have i mean obviously god would have figured it out you know he would have sustained it but like i feel like it would have just fizzled out like things would have fallen apart i'm pretty sure like several of the disciples would have fallen into depression and just like right i mean how do you it's almost like waking up from like the best dream ever yeah it's like man i was a fisherman i was just living my life like and then this man like called me and i followed him for these years and he like reworked the my whole framework for viewing the world and god and all of these things and now he's dead and i what do i do just go back to my dad's fishing business like yeah you know what's interesting i'm thinking i don't know if any of you guys have read chronicles of narnia but i'm thinking of the last book where susan is kind of saying that all of their journeys as kids was just like their imaginations like she starts to remember it wrong yeah she starts to remember it as just something that they made up she's gone back and rewards the narrative and so you kind of see like how each of the children in the chronicles of narnia's story is dealing with their experience as children yeah and and i so i kind of think of it like that i feel like some of the disciples would be like super crazy fanatical like jesus was real and like we have to do this but but they like they would be struggling to get other people on board right they seemed kind of crazy and then others of them would just be like oh he was just a man we were just like we were just bringing making him out to do more than he was like um yeah or some of them might have like thought fondly of jesus but kind of felt like yeah but i mean but he's not here with us anymore and so like it's kind of like was real but it's over but to me like i think more importantly is like okay so jesus did something for us on the cross and then he also did something for us by rising again right so like oh what's that verse oh i forgot to look it up um where paul talks about how like if there's no resurrection like we are to be pitied more than all men like so this is like a huge by the way just so you know like talking about the resurrection from the dead and the return of jesus was a huge huge theological of the early church as a matter of fact the first new testament books to be written were first and second thessalonians at least in our best guesses right like we can't say that with 100 certainty but um from like all of the scholarly evidence and history and everything like that first and second thessalonians are the first two books to be written including they were written before the gospels were written and it's um paul talking to this church in thessalonica about like it's dealing mostly with how we're all gonna rise from the dead like and and you see that like continually repeated by different biblical authors james touches on it the author of hebrews touches on it paul touches on it a ton john touches on it all the gospel writers touch on it like it's it's not just like one kooky guy over on the side who's like yeah like resurrection is a big deal it's like no everybody's on the same page about this what you have the verse there yeah it's um if christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith more than that we are then found to be false witnesses about god for we have testified about god that he raised christ from the dead but he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised either and if christ has not been raised your faith is futile you are still in your sins then those also who have fallen asleep in christ are lost if only for this life we have hope in christ we are to be pitied more than all men yeah bam there it is right there if only for this life and what's the reference for that it's first corinthians 15 15 yeah so if only for this life we have so so it's like okay jesus is kind of like on the cross he's like he takes all of our sins upon himself and he makes us right with god yeah but the world is still messed up like we still struggle with sin like and and and really all things have not been redeemed so if basically just the few of us who believe in jesus are only able to say like thank you god i'm glad that i can have a relationship with you because you already forgave my sins yeah but that's it you're still gonna live and die like any other chum on the earth you know like you're just right like and that's all there is right if that's it yeah what like what's even what's even the point and paul's like paul's um point i think is really well taken because he's like following jesus is not a piece of cake and so if we're expending all this effort just to like follow jesus for nothing more than the peace of mind on this earth right then people should feel sorry for us because that's sad yeah also i i want to mention it it goes on to say but christ has indeed been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep and i know yesterday we were talking about how jesus went before us like jesus went first and then he calls us to follow him yeah and that's the same with the resurrection like yeah jesus was the first fruits of of those who would be resurrected jesus was the first one to do it yeah and we're gonna do it too it was like an example of what one day we will do yeah that reminds me of um the one of the verses in the song so will i do you know the song so well i yeah um hillsong right i really love that song so i i just so it's it's you know that verse um god of salvation you chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride on a hill you created the light of the world abandoned to die in darkness to die and as you speak 100 billion failures disappear right that's what he did on the cross where you lost your life so i could find it here and then if you left the grave behind you so will i and to me like that's what this whole song is about right it's about this idea that the way you design things and the way that you exemplify things jesus empowers me to follow and so i'm responding by saying yes i will follow so will i but it's to me like that one line if you left the grave behind you so a lie is like oh i mean because that's exactly what we that's exactly what scripture teaches us it teaches us that jesus jesus's resurrection is what give gives us life yeah it's because of his resurrection that we're going to have life which is just to me so mind boggling to think and also like the first fruits of of of the resurrected including those who are already dead so i mean this not only impacts everyone who lives in human history after jesus came but everyone who lived before him yeah people who had faith in god and that were looking and waiting and hoping for the messiah that never even got a chance to see jesus but yet their hope and their faith was in god and they're just um i mean i think that i think scripture used i'm not sure if it was just in the new testament but you know the term hades which used to be a word that we used in english which doesn't mean hell actually hades is a place where the dead are which is why now now in english when we talk about it we talk about it as the grave yeah we'll say oh like death in the grave yeah but it it would be translated as hades which was kind of like i think the old testament they talked about it as like abraham's bosom or so what in revelations when it says he has the keys to hades yes it doesn't necessarily mean hell it's not actually hell oh [Music] but anyway about the keys to hell first of all i don't know if hell is locked but like god created hell and it's for satan to be punished yeah why does he want to kiss i don't know yeah it's not that's not satan's home like it's not satan's kingdom right like oh man that drives me crazy anyways but it's so funny how like you can grow up with these christian sayings and then create all of these like inconsistencies that like in your faith and if you never like continue to ruminate and reflect on the word and that's why i like to keep reading you have to yeah it's so crazy and it's and it's wild too because i think like it can be really hard when something that you took as granted turns out it's not true and then you're having this like you know almost like mini like crisis of like wait a second i thought that's how it was i've had several yeah and so then you and then you have to rethink things and but that is so healthy and so good right like if you don't do that you're just like you're allowing yourself basically to be full of like you're the solid ground that you're standing on is like swiss cheese because you never really learned like what the truth is and really like made it solid because it is salt like the word of god is solid yeah it is a firm foundation but so often we're susceptible to all of these misunderstandings and confusion and all this kind of stuff so anyway yeah like the resurrection just black saturday when i heard that it was when i learned that it was labeled black saturday i was like yeah i mean yeah the disciples were distraught and like in despair yeah which you can see because on easter sunday like they're just kind of like that it's like they don't know what to do and like it's like they hear that jesus is alive and only two of them go to verify like what is that yeah you know what i mean like and then and then you got downing thomas over here like he doesn't even believe what is going on with tom oh my goodness but it's like he wasn't the only one it was like all of them and and and it's just so crazy to me because jesus was so explicit yeah he told them so many times and he said like three days yeah yeah he was very cl like he wasn't like you know like in the future because i remember martha when jesus was talking about lazarus she was like oh yeah i know like in the future but he was talking about he said three days yeah and he and he was i mean there were times when he'd spoken parables right because he talked about like the temple being destroyed and being rebuilt in three days and he talked about like the sign of jonah being swallowed by the whale and then returning in three days like there were parables in there that he kind of used as prophecies to allude to what was going to happen to him with his death and resurrection but with his disciples he was rather explicit yeah and and yet it's almost as though like they were in a haze mm-hmm so it's almost like there was like a veil still over their eyes which maybe there was but we'll get a little bit more into that in a minute um but i wanted to also we we talked a lot yesterday about the cross yeah but i feel like there were a couple things that happened after jesus died that we didn't get to get into a little bit yeah there were a few aftershocks of the crucifixion so to say so we're going to read from matthew 27 verses 51 to 54. right and it says at that moment the curtain and the sanctuary this is right after jesus uh commends his spirit into god's hands and dies it says at that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom the earth shook rocks split apart and tombs opened the bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead they left the cemetery after jesus's resurrection went into the holy city of jerusalem and appeared to many people the roman officer and the other soldiers at the crucifixion were terrified by the earthquake and all that happened they said this man truly was the son of god this is so crazy that's crazy it's they're like these tiny little verses but like that's not a small thing yeah they just started walking around talking to people i wonder what happened to them me too i wish they would have wrote like biographies or something like it says they made appearances to many people like did they like disappear after those appearances or did they like go back to their families and live quiet lives until they died again yeah do they die of natural causes after that like i can't wait to find out what is the natural cause you might die from once you've already died yeah i mean assuming anyway you know what it's a it's clear why they died anyways but i think it's interesting like it says godly people or in um the niv it says holy people yeah i think it's interesting that it was obviously people that were close to god right before they had passed away yeah i think of like the prophetess anna yeah anna whatever you want to say i call her anna because i named my daughter after her and we call her anna jael so anyway but um who was like this godly woman that was waiting for the messiah and she met jesus when he was a baby yeah and simeon and john baptist dad what was his name uh that wasn't zachariah was it no yeah that's what i was gonna say but that's yeah you guys can check us but yeah so okay so dead people come back to life and go into the city yeah there's also um matthew doesn't say it but i think in luke it talks about how there's darkness like it's yeah i think it's like 3 p.m and it is 3 p.m like dark the sun is blotted out yeah yeah crazy and there's earthquakes i wonder why why why was there darkness in earthquakes i mean it's almost as if creation is mourning the death of them yeah it's interesting yeah i wonder like what that that is just so it's so fascinating to think about like was it like the do morning you know like was it just like an appropriate response that almost like creation because that we know like um is it romans where paul talks about how all creation is um like groaning waiting for the glory the glory to be revealed yeah so there definitely is i know like i'm definitely not like into like mother nature because i i don't i don't think that mother nature exists i believe that god created nature but nature itself seems to almost have yeah almost like a life of its own like not like a soul in the in the sense of the way humans do but like there's like this character to nature as a whole and i know david in the psalms talks about like creation worshiping god yes the fields the trees of fields clapping their hands jesus says the rocks will cry out like there's something some connection i mean certainly there's a connection between creation and the creator and you and i just i think back to genesis when god was looking over a thing he created and he said it was good like like he has a love for creation absolutely the earth matters yes yeah no and then um the veltorn i remember in in bible college you did a word study on how on that from top to bottom yeah the veil expressly was torn from top to bottom which to me is fascinating because when you think of like a fabric being torn you think of someone like holding the top two pieces and then just like tearing it apart you know like yeah right and it's just like i don't know to me that's i don't know from top to bottom some angel of god like coming from heaven above you know and kind of descending upon the temple and grabbing the you know the curtain and tearing it apart i mean i don't know if it was an angel or whatever but like what was it that made the veil torn yeah to me to me those things are so fascinating because they're concrete and they're material and yet they're clearly incredibly spiritual yeah this was like a spiritual reality i mean i mean maybe it wasn't an angel maybe it was the very presence of you know the hand of god himself tearing tearing the veil but it's like a mixed bag because i feel like the dead rising like that's like awesome and good but then like earthquakes and darkness that's kind of like scary and bad but then the veil being torn like that's awesome and good yeah it's at least good for those of us who want who want the presence of god failed to be torn you know what i mean i wonder what they because because like they would have had to fix the fail i guess because there are still two like jewish people who we're still practicing believe that the messiah came yet and this was the veil between the holy of holies and so like the hot spot of god's presence where no one was allowed to go right yeah and who did they contract to like did they because the way that the curtain was made too it was one whole piece of fabric they were not allowed to join it wasn't like a quilt or like to join multiple pieces of fabric which was incredibly difficult to do in those days because they didn't have like machinery to make giant i mean this is a massive curtain yeah and so it was one giant piece of fabric the old testament talks about how it had to be one one woven as one piece of fabric and so they couldn't have had somebody like like you know sew it together yeah like oops i tore my pants you know like throw together real quick like you know anyways yeah who knows what they did about that i think it's funny that like god decided to tear the veil like it was purely symbolic i mean was it i don't know i think i see it as symbolic in the sense that like we can enter the presence of god now we don't have to rely on a high priest yeah um but it wasn't just a symbol that god's presence was at the temple yeah that was real right the temple was not but i mean like the actual tearing of the cross okay yeah yeah they were just gonna mend it again anyways like right you know you would almost think though like that this would be like an attempt on god's part to bring revelation hmm yeah almost like reaching out i wonder if there were like if there were people at the temple who saw that and believed right because of it i bet because we talked about the roman guys who like saw the earthquakes and everything and they were like yeah surely this was the son of god they basically got saved after that put their faith in jesus yeah so yeah i mean i bet people were really like i bet jesus was still gathering followers on black saturday oh cool while he was dead and inactive supposedly at least on the earth yeah i love jesus um you know one of the things that really stands out to me about the the like aftershocks of the crucifixion is that it almost seems to me as though the disciples faith was taking a hit but everybody else else's faith seems to be bolstered even the pharisees like yeah do you have a verse about the pharisees yes yes um so they were okay so it's matthew 27 62-66 the next day on the sabbath the leading priests and pharisees went to see pilate they told him sir we remember that deceiver once said while he was still alive after three days i will rise from the dead see even they remember after right for sorry the pharisees disciples can't remember oh man so we request that you seal the tomb until the third day this will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead if that happens we'll be worse off than we were at first pilot replied take guards and secure it's the best you can so they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it yeah i think maybe i don't know where i got this idea maybe this is just my assumption but i think some of the pharisees had a sneaking suspicion that jesus was the real deal like there they're like oh that deceiver and his disciples yeah it's like scooby-doo and his friends those meddling kids might steal the body and right and try to tell everyone he's alive but i bet some i bet they were shaking in their boobs i mean yeah they like maybe they said that because i mean they probably wanted that to be the truth but maybe they said that as a cover-up like oh i don't want them to think like i actually right right but so let me just say like the disciples are gonna take him you know but they were actually afraid that jesus was gonna raise from the dead yeah it's like when you're afraid of the dark and you're like i mean i'm totally comfortable but maybe we should turn the light on so we don't trip you know yeah so we don't trip and fall or you know so my you know younger sibling doesn't get too scared you know yeah so these people who are so easily influenced don't get the wrong idea that he was real you know yeah um but yeah so crazy well i just wanted to share this kind of devotional thought with you all um today on black saturday one of the things that really stands out to me about black saturday is where the disciples were and it's not so much where was jesus but where were the disciples and it seems to me as though based on their reactions on sunday that a lot of them were really struggling with their faith and that things had not turned out the way that they had hoped that jesus the jesus journey ended up being way harder than any of them had imagined it would have been and way more um grievous and that they were just like holding on for dear life you know and like getting by yeah i mean we know judas already killed himself which i mean judas is his own story we talked a lot about yesterday but it just it just seems like the disciples were really dis disum courage discouraged and i wanted to speak to us today because so at the beginning of holy week on palm sunday jesus arrived symbolically and literally as the coming king the anointed one that that all the earth and god's people had been waiting for and he he came in riding on a donkey bringing his message of peace with him and his beautiful heart and his love for his people he was the coming king he was the messiah and they came to understand that he was the messiah then they were struggling to remember the words that he told them that he was going to die and that he was going to raise again and so things got hard and it's almost like they lost sight of what was ahead yeah but i don't fault them because i think that we do the exact same thing jesus is still our coming king jesus is still our messiah we are still waiting for his majestic you know royal arrival to the earth and to make all things new and and yet it's so easy to lose sight of that and it's really really easy to i think even to question that and the disciples they were waiting on black saturday we have been waiting for two millennia now um and so yeah i just wanted to encourage you to remember the words of jesus and to keep your heart and keep your mind focused on the coming king and so there are a couple of scriptures that i wanted to read together as we're kind of wrapping up this holy week the book of revelation john has a vision um and he jesus reveals a ton of things to him and so the whole book is him writing out everything that jesus revealed to him but he starts off the book in chapter one talking about the appearance of jesus and he says um starting in verse 13 and standing in the middle of the lamp stands with someone like the son of man he was wearing a long robe with a gold sash across his chest his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were like flames of fire and his feet like polished bronze refined in a furnace and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves he held seven stars in his right hand and a sharp two-edged sword came from his mouth and his face was like the sun in all its brilliance and when i saw him i fell at his feet as if i were dead but he laid his right hand on me and said don't be afraid i am the first and the last i am the living one i died but look i am alive forever and ever and i hold the keys of death and a grave and then he goes on to to to say all the incredible things that are in the book of revelation but that's that's our jesus that's john seeing him and hearing him speak and that's jesus saying like here i am i died but i'm alive and i hold the keys of death in the grave and i just i i don't know to me that's like so relevant to holy week you know holy week is the culmination of the revelation of god through jesus and and jesus was very clear with us that he was returning there's no like question about it as a matter of fact at the very end of the book of revelation which is the very end of our bible jesus is quoted in chapter 22 verse um 12-13 he says look i am coming soon bringing my reward with me to repay all people according to their deeds i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning in the end and that's just like that's the truth that i want us to hold on to he is the beginning in the end yeah the beginning and the end jesus isn't done with us jesus is not done with humanity he is still at work um yeah hebrews chapter 9 verse 28 another passage that i wanted to share with you so also christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people he will come again not to deal with our sins but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him and i love that i love that idea that like jesus came and he already dealt with sins the judgment for sins has ultimately it's already been handled so when he comes back he's not coming back to judge between you know who sinned and who didn't sin he's coming back to judge between who received his salvation and has earned the reward that he has for them yeah well earned i think is probably the wrong word but right yeah who's accepted it and yeah who has won it yeah you know who's joined with him in his victory procession throughout human history yeah um so yeah i mean hebrews we have right there talking about jesus coming back and i wanted to make sure that i read a g that i read jesus own words to us about his return i don't know if you recall on thursday um there was a passage we had to skip this long passage in john several chapters where jesus is talking to his disciples before he's arrested these are some of the last things that he said to them some of these things that he was just i need to leave you with these things i can't i can't go without saying these things and so this is how he began that whole speech john chapter 14 don't let your hearts be troubled trust in god and trust also in me there is more than enough room in my father's home if this were not so would i have told you that i am going to prepare a place for you when everything is ready i will come and get you so that you will always be with me where i am going and you know the way to where i'm going and then thomas no we don't lord tom said we have no idea where you're going so how can we know the way jesus told him i am the way i love that i love that so much i mean there's there's a ton more to that passage but um john chapter 14 again anytime you're looking for something to read read john 14 15 16 17. they're amazing but jesus himself there you have it right from the mouth of jesus i am returning and he wasn't talking about his resurrection there he was talking about going to be with the father and preparing a place for us so we know that when jesus died and then rose again he stayed on the earth for another 40 days and then he ascended to heaven and so we've been waiting for him to return since that time but he promised us that he would when everything was ready and peter talks to us about how waiting on god we know that he's not slow right he's not slow to fulfill his promises he's patient with us yeah because he doesn't want anyone to perish and so jesus is at work on the earth today through you and me through his spirit and so what are you doing today to partner with what jesus is doing on the earth what are you doing in your life to partner with the will of our coming king and are is your heart is your heart stayed fast on god are you thinking about his arrival and his return and are you cherishing that and letting your life be shaped by the reality of his return that's exactly what he told us to do and so as his followers let's make sure that we don't get caught in a haze like yeah i don't really know what's going on i know jesus did some cool things once upon a time but now it seems like nothing's happening no jesus is alive and well he always has been he always will be he is at work and he is busy doing things and he wants us to remember him so let's do that yeah all right let's pray uh dear god i thank you so much for what you did on the cross but i thank you for rising

world situation in prayer continuing to pray for those that are struggling with uh covet 19 and for the situation between russia and ukraine and continue to pray if if you would like to if you're thinking to yourself what in the world could i possibly do and if you would like to give something to that you can in our in our church center app in our giving portal there there's a category called ukraine and what we will do with any money that is given through the church towards that 100 of it will go to compassion uh work for those that are fleeing right now and to work with refugee organizations because uh there's going to be a ton of ukrainians coming to the united states as temporarily protected tps categorized individuals and so there's going to be a lot of work that's done and we are reaching out to refugee organizations locally to see how we can participate as a local church as well just so you know that that's happening behind the scenes and again parents please don't forget to register for the training this saturday for you that was just advertised on the screen have you ever noticed in life things happen just just things happen stuff happens other people say it a different way and sometimes there's a reason behind those things some people say that there's a reason for everything i know i know for sure you've heard that there's a reason i firmly believe there's a reason for everything yeah a lot of times there's a reason for everything because people are stupid people do things they thought not to do i ran out of gas in my car not because god had a providential plan but because i forgot to fill it up with gas okay or because it's 17 a gallon right now okay so you know maybe maybe there's other reasons that are happening there other times there are things that take place uh that are more serious but a lot of times the things that happen are just ridiculous that's why shows like america's funniest home videos exists all right if you're 347 pounds and you get up on a piece of plastic furniture there's a video that needs to be taken all right there's a video that needs to be taken that happens and so you understand that sometimes stuff happens because we're just doing dumb things but then there's other times that stuff happens that seems like it comes from someplace else and i'm talking about the bad stuff there's bad stuff that happens you're like something is behind that something's trying to mess with me something's trying to take me out take me down from just after the creation of humanity of adam and eve let's go all the way back to the beginning the author of death himself shows up the serpent the dragon satan shows up to start to destroy relationships and in as we go into week two of our messy series the serpent tries at the very beginning the serpent tries to place a wedge a division between adam and eve and he also tries to place a wedge between adam and eve and god and he tries to get adam and eve broken up right from the very beginning i think it's interesting that one of the very first attacks on humanity from the enemy has to do with breaking up relationships stop for a moment and think about it the very very first attack from the serpent was on the nature of relationship why because when god created relationships their power the power and potential of relationships for creativity for beauty for health for wholeness for life and unity and love were nearly limitless the power was unbelievable and previous to this moment the relationship between the father the son jesus and the holy spirit what we call the trinity was perfect and unbreakable so you have this perfect relationship already and satan had already once tried to overthrow the trinity he'd already tried to break it up in isaiah chapter 14 14 there's a quote attributed to satan it says i will climb to the highest heavens and he and be like the most high satan was trying to overthrow he's trying to become god like god he tried to overthrow the trinity and establish himself as god and as a result satan was defeated and cast out and so when god's beloved us in case you didn't know who that was when god's beloved shows up on earth satan immediately goes to work trying to wreck relationships let me read some of that account for you today genesis chapter 3 going back to the very beginning the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild animals the lord god had made one day he asked the woman this is eve did god really say you must not eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden of course we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden the woman replied it's only the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden that we're not allowed to eat god said you must not eat or even touch it if you do you will die you won't die the serpent replied to the woman god knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it and you will be like god knowing both good and evil the woman was convinced somebody said convinced she saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious she wanted the wisdom it would give her she took some of the fruit and ate it then she gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it too and at that moment their eyes were opened and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness so they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves when the cool evening breezes were blowing the man and his wife heard the lord god walking about in the garden so they hid from the lord god among the trees then the lord god called to the man where are you he replied i heard you were walking in the garden so i hid i was afraid because i was naked who told you that you were naked the lord god asked have you eaten from the tree whose fruit i commanded you not to eat the man replied it was the woman it really really that's what it says it was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit and i ate it it was more like it was the woman and i ate it and ever since that moment men have been blaming women for their bad behavior that's true also so today i'm about to teach you something that can save your life save your relationships we're starting with this four killer ways to sabotage your relationships four killer ways you're like oh i got this one mastered faster i don't even need this sermon i i got 75 of those i got 75 of those well from the text today verse 1 one day he asked the woman if you want to sabotage a relationship listen to the wrong voice she listened to the wrong voice this is the first lesson that we learned from the story today and eve she listened to the wrong voice whatever you do friends don't listen to the serpent whatever you do don't listen to satan don't even allow the serpent to finish the question get it she had to entertain the question don't even give permission for the serpent to be close enough to you for you to be able to hear the question i don't know if this works this way in your life but it certainly works this way in mind there are there are places in this world that i know satan hangs out at i know i know that he's there i don't have to guess he's there 24 7 365 and a quarter he is there all the time and i know if i go over to that place i can hear satan so it's best for me not to go near places where i can hear satan i don't even want to be close enough that i can hear you see we have to have a different kind of attitude when it comes to our relationship with listening to the wrong voices i mean literally we need to become more militant spiritually in this sense and be ready to say things like i command you satan in the name of jesus christ put down your weapons and flee you're going to hear the voice of satan from time to time you might hear it all the time you've got to learn to say shut your mouth satan you have no permission to speak into my life you are the father of lives or like buddy the elf you sit on a throne of lies and i will not listen to anything you say you've got to make a decision and have an attitude and posture yourself spiritually you simply will not listen you will not entertain say the enemy your whispers are not welcome your taunts are deflected your shouts they fall on deaf ears but if you want to sabotage your relationships then start listening to the wrong voice if you want to mess your relationships up just listen to the wrong voice otherwise don't listen to the wrong voices the wrong voices have a way of showing up all over the place first off they show up in your head like wrong voices show up in your head you don't even have to go someplace bad like it's just in your head let me help you with this just because you think it doesn't mean you should listen to it just because you had the thought doesn't mean you have to engage with it you can tell your own thoughts to settle down you can speak to your own thinking and we should if your thinking is out of alignment with the scripture if your thinking is out of alignment with what god says you're allowed to tell it to redirect your own thoughts and you definitely don't have to put it on facebook or instagram you shouldn't probably ever another place wrong voices show up is in your family unfortunately for many of us family have the greatest access to your core being and if that family dynamic that you're in has ever spoken lies into your life if your family dynamic has ever spoken death over you if it currently speaks death over you or speaks discouragement to you then you must take the effort to place those voices into the wrong voice category and then go through the process of removing their access to your ears to your heart and to your mind it might be your family but you don't have to listen to their voice that's i'm not saying that's easy but that's what needs to be done other wrong voices show up uh like on your screens due to the nature of how the entertainment and media industry now makes its money it's there's nothing balanced about what's going on out there it's all about sensational or ridiculous or scandalous rather than healthy or encouraging and uplifting i don't think there's a netflix channel or a channel or a or a any kind of thing out there right now that is based on healthy encouraging and uplifting that we have like seven subscribers all right so that's that's just not what's happening most of the time and then other wrong voices could simply be other people other people in your life maybe at work friends people from your past that are speaking things that simply are harmful or unhelpful or unproductive there are things that will literally lead you down the wrong path and there we have to shut those voices down as well now you may not want to yell at them and say get away from me satan but if that's what it takes that's fine that's fine second thing she entertained the wrong voice so first she listened and then she entertained verse two she says this of course we may eat fruit from the tree in the garden the woman replied what's the problem with this the problem is she accepted the question and started to respond to the question she's now entertaining it she's flirting with trouble not only does she listen instead of walking away but she engages she entertains and i hope you know this but when you entertain a fool in your life or foolish thought what happens what happens when you entertain a mocker or what happens if you let it step into your house into your life the longer that you engage or entertain the fool or the mocker or the serpent the longer you insist on exploring or discovering the dark side the more you decide that you are strong enough to handle the innocent flirtation with the pleasures of this world the more lies that you begin to believe the more lies that you begin to let collect all over you and you are covered with lies and those lies begin to attach to you in dark places what happens when the devil starts chatting you up is that he's trying to set you up sometimes he's going in for the quick kill sometimes he is content messing you up for a day or a week but other times the enemy is simply setting you up for the long con he's chatting you up to set you up so that you will start to listen so you will start to entertain the thoughts and you start to think these thoughts you start to let yourself believe maybe he's right maybe he's on to something maybe the bible is just too restrictive maybe jesus would handle things differently in a modern 2022 world maybe my pastor is just a middle-aged redneck from the corn fields and doesn't understand these are all possible things that you could entertain be careful with listening definitely don't entertain she also followed the wrong voice verse 6 it says the woman was convinced what was she convinced of she was convinced of the lies that satan had just told her she saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious and she wanted the wisdom it would give her so she took some fruit and ate it she listened she entertained now she's convinced if i could tell you a secret sometimes we want to be convinced of something else sometimes in our own pain and our own disillusionment our own chaos our own confusion sometimes we want to believe something else which is why you started listening to begin with which is why you began to entertain something that you know to be wrong to begin with many many years ago when i was pastoring in youth ministry this young teenager that i had been working with she calls me up and she's just a mess this is actually back when you had to call you couldn't text there was no cell phones there was no there weren't even pagers yet and so it was a long time ago and so she calls me she's crying she's having a hard time and i'm like what's going on and she says to me she says to me this is just like a sweet girl and she was confessing all of her deepest darkest secrets which was that after school that day that she had gone out into the woods and was was smoking smoking cigarettes that was that was the big confession that was the big confession okay she was mortified that she had started and and uh and after a while i'm like i was like okay let me help you why are you smoking and she says this she goes i just want to be bad that's what she said to me it just kind of stuck with me for all these years and i think that that is the reality sometimes in life we just want to be bad sometimes we just want to mess it all up whether we were secretly hoping to get into a crazy situation but other times you're authentically blindsided you didn't see it coming you weren't trying it just kind of happened sometimes we follow the wrong voice but sometimes when we follow the wrong voice we get pummeled i mean seriously pummeled like teeth missing blood dripping from your nose and lips lying on the ground spiritually and emotionally thinking to yourself what happened here's my suggestion for you in this moment don't hide from that don't pretend like it didn't happen don't cover it up because you are afraid and don't cover it up because you are ashamed rather take it as an opportunity for growth so you don't ever get into that situation again take notes make a road map and say don't go here on a similar note please don't surrender while you are on the ground don't give up while you're in the pit of despair or in a dark place of depression don't give up when it's hard simply make a note and remember not to take that route again as a freshman in high school i listened to some wrong voices i followed some wrong voices you're like i've got to find something else about pastor kirk i did not know i joined the football team i only weighed 98 pounds when i was a freshman in high school that's not very big in case you're wondering i joined the football team i put on the pads and i put on the helmet they didn't have a helmet small enough for me or pads small enough for me they were big and i won't forget the first time i actually went into a football game we were up by over 50 points they're like it's safe we can let him in six minutes left to play it's marked in my memory i was playing deep safety they wanted me as far away from the ball as possible the action and and the fullback from the other team broke through the line and passed everybody else on my team i was the only one left to have a chance to tackle him 220 pounds senior from the other team was running full steam ahead and did not even try to miss me again 98 pounds he lowered his helmet and shoulder at me ran straight through me and over me but the shock and amazement of all including myself was that i actually tackled him and prevented his certain touchdown well that's only part of the truth the whole truth is i didn't really tackle him rather he tripped on me and fell down when he stepped on me because his foot got caught in my oversized uniform and he literally tripped down true story i'm so happy that was not on video so i took a note to myself while i was lying on the ground in pain trying to catch my breath and said to myself self next season we're playing tennis and that's what happened that's what happened that's the note don't go play football again okay probably on a much more serious level you have things in your life when you're on the ground it's time to take a note and just don't go that way again the fourth thing here to like a surefire way to sabotage your relationship number four is perpetuate the wrong voice or she perpetuated here's what she did verse 6 it says she gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it too maybe you've had somebody in your life that you were supposed to trust or that you did trust and they exposed you or introduced you to things that you should not have been introduced to and here's the hard and difficult truth when you go down you never go down by yourself when you fail in life it's not just in a vacuum you take someone with you or you harm somebody else on your way down the reality is that the greater the influence in your life the greater harm you can do to others when you fail it's not to say you won't fail we all will but it is important to remember that we need to be careful the greater your influence the greater the attack that the enemy will place upon you when you become a parent you will be exposed to a new level of attack in your life and i don't mean from your children i mean from the enemy when you become a servant you will experience greater levels of attack when you become a leader you will experience greater levels of attack when you step up to the next level in your life you will experience greater levels of attack you're thinking to yourself i'm just not going to improve that'll i'll avoid the whole thing that's part of the attack as well the bigger that this church gets the greater its influence the greater the attack is that's on its leaders in fact some of you don't know this but the higher the level of leadership and influence that you grow into at our church the greater the boundaries that we encourage to be placed in your life why so that the guard rails those boundaries can help protect you so that when you if you go down it'll be limited that's why they have guard rails on narrow mountain roads when you travel the different parts of the country because the consequences for error on a narrow mountain road are very costly you go off you die but if there's a guard rail there it can save you because we understand this principle when you rise up you take others with you and when you go down you take others with you so we're careful to who we listen to what we entertain and certainly what we perpetuate so don't perpetuate the wrong voice you ever see one of those kids that stick stuff up their nose like little three four-year-old kids they just love sticking stuff up their nose taking a little like peas and like shooting them across the that's middle school okay that's a little bit older but you know kids are doing this well i was one of those kids and so i stuck this paper wad up my nose once so far when i was really little that i couldn't see it and i couldn't blow it out but it didn't bother me so i just left it there but out of after about three days my nose started to run bad that my body didn't like this my nasal cavity began to get infected this is so gross and and my parents thought that i was in real trouble like like what's going on with our son he stinks literally i stunk like i was rotting and we didn't have any money and they'd have money to take me to the doctor money to rush me to the er and so they picked me up put me on their lap held their nose and prayed for me and when i got off their laps i walked into the other room and i sneezed the biggest sneeze that i've ever sneezed and out of my nasal cavities came this rotten decline got decaying glob of paper and snot out of my nose onto the floor this is a great family story that they tell repeatedly it was destroying me from the inside i had no idea what's the point first don't put paper wads too far up your nose that's the first point second is when you ignore problems they get worse they don't get better we must all deal with the challenges and the voices that are attacking us every single day the chaos of this world has a way of hitting the fan and splattering into your life where you never asked for it you didn't ask for it but it's there so we still have to deal with it i've said this a million times it may not be your fault but it's still your problem you still have to deal with it chaos happens it is inevitable to live life simply means dealing with the chaos and the pain and confusion that we are wrestling with god knows that the enemy is roaming about trying to steal kill and destroy and god knows what you're facing and he wants to help you get rid of the enemy in your life there's a very important principle here is that god is on your side he wants for you for this to take place he doesn't want you to live under defeat he wants you to live in victory just just a few weeks ago i hear something weird outside and and my wife tells me to take a look outside and there's a coyote in my neighborhood i live in lint and there's a coyote in my neighborhood i don't live by the woods and i i go outside and i see this coyote and he's literally in the middle of the street like he owns the street it's late at night i make sure the dog doesn't go out i'll have a little dog and the coyote's just like like he rules the neighborhood it was kind of scary i'm like i'm not gonna let that coyote rule the neighborhood so i go out on the porch and i start to scream and yell and he goes he moves just a little bit then he stops and he just stares at me and i'm like i backed up [Laughter] i don't know what a coyote does and so i start to make more noise and then i notice just to my right i see two beady eyes of another coyote it's like stalking in the dark like looking at me and so i closed the door and then screamed a little bit louder okay but here's here's the deal i made sure that we didn't feed those coyotes here's the you're always going to have an attack you're always going to have an enemy you're always going to have a voice that's not helpful for you don't feed the voices you've got to learn to rise up and rule over the voices you are in charge rise and rule as the worship team comes up so what about all this chaos and confusion bad decisions of your own bad decisions of somebody else financial collapse failing health of your own body failing health of a loved one expected or unexpected tragedy relationship confusion betrayal rebellion and endless list of schemes of the enemy what are we supposed to do with this what you're supposed to do with it is to rise up with the risen jesus christ we're supposed to begin to rule over these situations not to listen not to engage not to entertain verse 9 it says when the lord god called to the man where are you god knew where he was he was giving the man an opportunity to come back to him remember god knows right where you are at and no matter how much in your life is messed up god still has a plan for you to reach you right where you are don't give up simply recognize your loss and you take the loving and gracious hand of jesus as he lifts you back up don't glorify the failure glorify the redeemer glorify the redemption allow christ to restore you allow christ to redeem you allow christ to reconcile you so that you can rise up and rule over the circumstances that have emerged in your life listen if you're walking through an unfamiliar area and suddenly realize that you are carrying with you a rather unpleasant aroma at the bottom of your shoe because you stepped in something foul do you leave it there i hope not do you simply say oh well that's not so bad i can live with it no you deal with it as fast as you can you find something to wipe the bottom of your shoe on in order to get rid of it you don't want to bring it with you anymore so you get rid of it might i suggest to you today that when you step in the poo of life that you wipe it off on the head of the serpent [Music] verse 14 then the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are cursed more than all animals domestic and wild you will crawl on your belly groveling in the dust as long as you live and i will cause hostility between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offstring and he will strike your head and you will strike his heel that's a prophecy a really important prophecy for us that has been fulfilled in jesus and continues to be filled each time we advance the kingdom of god each time a sinner is reconciled to god each time a garbage heap of a life is redeemed each time that a family is restored the serpent in the garden is crushed underneath your feet and romans 16 20 says the god of peace will soon crush satan under your feet stand with me as we close today this worship team closes us right now maybe there's some things that you've been listening to or entertaining that you need to right now do some spiritual work on you need to ask god for courage and strength and you need to turn it over to god and you literally need to renounce the work of satan that he has been doing the voices that you've

this morning because i believe you got something to say and i'm excited for it uh but let me introduce myself my name is jesse lobato i have the awesome opportunity and privilege to be the youth and media pastor here at east coast international church and i'm also one of those annoying youth pastors i just gotta say real quick what's up camille i told you i'm gonna call you out [Applause] i told i was gonna do it yesterday but uh but not only that i am also a husband to the amazing beautiful and talented hoana lobato in the back over there i always always got to give a shout out to my wife i'm just that guy but uh more recently couple weeks ago i got to celebrate my brother's marriage which was kind of crazy to think because years ago i would never have expected to be in the place where i was able to be his best man and um and i was yeah and i was a good best man i'll tell you that right now i had the opportunity to give a best man speech and i think i really do that it was probably top two greatest best man speeches of all time and i wanna let you know that it wasn't number two all right so we i i did some good good speaking but uh i'm just kidding i promise i'm humble guys oh but as i was preparing for this speech for my brother right um made me super reminiscent of our childhood because me and him we've been through a lot together one of the things i always say is that there were times where my big brother was my big brother and there were times where my big brother was my little brother and i was his big brother and so like we had such a childhood and growing up we didn't have much so we learned how to enjoy every little thing that we did have and while in our childhood everybody had playstation 2s and gamecubes and an xbox me and my brother had none other than the nintendo 64. anybody ever heard of the town 64. yeah i know my teenagers are all wondering what the heck that is but it was a good console it's a good console so we would always play that and one day there was a yard sale happening down the street and my brother wanted to go check it out so he gets up on out the door and heads to this yard sale but we have neighbors these two brothers that were like you know what we're going to tag along with you and he was cool and so they walked down to this yard sale and as my brother's looking around he sees none other than this steering wheel and you're probably like what what it was a steering wheel controller for the nintendo 64. so my man was hyped he was like i need to get this thing but i don't know if you guys ever been to yard sales sometimes you buy something and you bring it home and that thing don't work and you just lost 15 bucks you know what i mean so my brother went to the guy like a smart wise man he is you know and he was like hey like listen i really really want this thing i will give you money to buy this thing i just want to go home and just test it out see if it works and i will come back and i was like perfectly okay that's fine and so my brother takes it and my neighbors are next to him and they go hey well you know what let me hold it for you since we're going back to the same place i got you my brother didn't think anything of it but our neighbors also had a nintendo 64 and they wanted that steering wheel but the guy said that that was my brother's and he was going to take home but again my brother was super like oblivious to it all so he just let him hold it so they're all walking together and the minute that this yard sale and this guy was out of sight out of line these dudes dashed home to go to their dad to get some money so they can buy the steering wheel that was given to my brother and so next thing you know my brother comes home out of breath because he was running back to chase after them they had scooters so it's a little bit of an advantage on their part he comes home out of breath face is red tired tears dwelling up in his eyes and i'm like yo what's going on like this this dude's like you you seem like you went through something bro and i will never forget it the most dramatic thing he just walks over to the kitchen counter was like bro they took it and i was like what are you talking about and he explained the whole situation how he had this steering wheel he went to the guy the guy gave it to him to go try it out so he can go by it was his but then the neighbors came and took it and they wanted to claim it as their own the neighbors took and stole my brother's steering wheel and so he was upset and sad and he was hopeless just like literally just accepting the fee and i remember asking him like wait a minute was it given to them or was it given to you and he was like it was given to me and i was like then it's yours bro so you need to stop crying get up go back to that guy and tell him they took what was yours and so that's what he did you know he got everything like just got himself together sucked those tears back in and he went outside and as he was going outside these dudes was already in their scooters getting ready to go back to the yard sale to pay for the thing and i remember as my brother was running back to try to keep up with them i was like oh jonathan you got it and it was the funniest thing and so obviously my brother doesn't beat them they get there and they're talking with the guy and the guy sees my brother from his like peripheral vision walking up again out of breath emotions on a high tears coming out of his eyes and he's like what is going on and so he tells the guy the steering wheel that you gave to me they took it and they're trying to buy it now and the guy looks at them and goes oh really he asks the son to come out talks to his son his son goes back in and next thing you know his son comes out with like 10 cartridges of nintendo 64 games and not like the whack ones like you know like there were some terrible games for 1064 but it was a good stuff like diddy kong racing mario kart super mario 64. it was all the legend of zelda it was the best stuff yeah right and it gets even better he was like you know what you can have that for free you want that steering wheel y'all got to pay for it and it was the best aha moment i've ever witnessed because my brother got something something was taken from my brother that belonged to him and when he went to get it back not only did he get something but he got more than when he originally had anybody in the room ever had something taken from you that was yours like that was rightfully yours right it's the worst i still look back to this mongoose this blue mongoose bike that i had i let my i was a friend i met him that day and he needed a ride home and i was like bro borrow it bring it back i'm still waiting okay that was a long time ago i still waited but it's the worst man that was my mom goose right but it's the absolute worst when you get something taken from you that's rightfully yours and many times when something's taken from us i i think like the reaction is you know what that's enough we caught the loss right there let's just move on from it it's gone it's never coming back but i believe today god wants to change that narrative i believe today god wants to let you know that you can get that thing back and maybe it's not neighbors stealing a steering wheel for your nintendo 64. but the bible tells us of a thief that exists in every single one of our lives and in john 10 10 jesus says that the thief comes to only steal kill and destroy and that thief is satan we have a thief around us that is prowling around waiting to snatch up any little thing that he possibly can from our lives and for some of us in this room today he successfully done it for some of us the enemy has stolen our joy our confidence for some of us the enemy has stolen our health maybe our sobriety for some of us the enemy has stolen our financial stability and for some of us the enemy has stolen our friends children and family members who probably aren't following jesus at the moment and for a lot of us it probably happened within the last two years alone and many times when the enemy comes when a thief comes to steal we just feel defeated we accept the loss not believing that we can ever get it back but how many know in this room that god is in the business of taking back what the enemy is doing hey man all right so we're going to get into that today it's going to be good today i want to talk to you about king david and the story of david is a super interesting one so just to bring you guys up to speed on where we're at i want to give you like a little spark notes overview of david's life okay so real quick he was chosen to be king of israel after a man named king saul disqualified himself from that throne and god told a prophet named samuel that hey there's a guy named jesse and one of his children are the next king of israel and i need you to go and to anoint them with oil and so samuel goes and he goes to this man jesse and says hey one of your kids about to be king and so he was like alright cool i'll get all my kids he brought all of his kids out except for one and his name was david and it's because all the other brothers were soldiers warriors were hefty guys that were big and meanwhile david was just a shepherd's boy who just did his thing way out in the back and he wasn't really paid attention to but obviously one by one god was saying that's not the king that's not the king until they found david and david ended up being the king here but he wasn't king right away king saul was still king and even there was even a point where where david fought this giant named goliath and and beat him and it was a moment where nobody in the israelite army wanted to fight goliath not even king saul wanted to fight goliath and david took that stand he went up he defeated goliath and still he was not king as a matter of fact instead of becoming king he ended up going on this super long pursuit where king saul was trying to kill david so that he can keep the throne and so david is on the run now avoiding saul and eddie any way he can keeping his eyes off when i open when he's sleeping he's doing everything he can to make sure saul don't catch him and at one point he finds a cave and he runs into it and word got out that he was in this cave and so relatives of his siblings of his and other people that the bible says were in trouble in debt or who were just discontent somehow heard that he was in this cave and they went to him and so now there's this careful of all these people and they're like yo david i want you to be the commander of all of us and so david became the commander of all these dudes that were just cast out and so now he has this whole group of people now and he thinks to himself and had this idea he was like well one day saul is going to catch me and so i have to do whatever i can to avoid him and the best thing i can do is to escape to the philistines so david takes himself and his group his army and joins the philistines and now for those of you who don't know the philistines and the israelites were like what the los angeles lakers were to the boston celtics way back when like they were rivals bro like you know i didn't like you on and off the court you don't like me if i see you it's on site it's going down they were rivals obviously today the lakers are terrible and the celtics are about to get a chip so it's a little different you know yeah game seven today we gotta we gotta pray for the celtics um but the analogy works from back then right and so there he he joins this rival army and now him and his men are in the army and one day the philistines are preparing for battle and they're fighting none other than the israelites and as we know the israelites were david's people they were his men's people and as the philistine commanders are getting ready to for war they realize that david and his men are there and they ask what are these hebrew men doing here they knew they got they caught him right right from the start they knew he was an israelite and so after an attempt of convincing that david and his men are loyal the commanders just didn't trust them and so because of that they gave him the boot and now david and his men have been fired from the philistine army and they're walking back to their town and home to their families and this is where we pick up and the bible says in first samuel chapter 30 starting at verse one that three days later when david and his men arrived home at their town of ziklag they found that the amalekites had made a raid into negev and ziklag they had crushed ziklag and burned it to the ground they had carried off the woman and children and everyone else but without killing anyone when david and his men saw the ruins and realized what had happened to their families they wept until they could weep no more david's two wives abinam from jezreel and abigail the widow of nepal from carmel were among those captured david was now in great danger because all his men were very bitter about losing their sons and daughters and they began to talk about stoning him but david found strength in the lord his god then he said to abiathar the priest bring me the ephod so abayathar brought it then david asked the lord should i chase after this band of raiders while i catch them and the lord said yes go after them you will surely recover everything that was taken from you as the men arrived in their town as they were walking back from just being fired man i don't know if i've ever been fired but i have it but i'm sure the walk back is not good you know what i mean being laid off like that and i'm sure they wanted to go back to their families they wanted to go back to a nice home-cooked meal and instead they found out their homes were all destroyed and burned to the ground that all the things they possessed were stolen and that their family was taken from them by the enemy and the bible says when david and all of his men saw this they wept until they could no longer weep they cried until there were literally no tears left to cry and with their emotions at an all-time high david's men looked around saw the chaos that had just erupted and blamed david for the whole situation and even threatened to stone him because of it and all that left david alone and in immense danger and while the men reacted to their situation by finding someone to blame for all of it david looked to god and david asked the lord should i chase after this band of raiders will i catch them and the lord told him yes go after him you will surely recover everything that was taken from you maybe you're in this room revere online finding yourself in a in the same predicament as david you're in a season of life where the enemy has stolen something from you you feel lost you feel defeated it's hard to have hope and you wonder if you'll ever get that thing back i want to let you know today that if that is you i believe what god said to david god is saying to us today that you will surely recover everything all right tell your neighbor you will surely recover everything and in case your other neighbor didn't hear it let them know you will surely recover everything all right so let's let's see how david did just that so david was in a situation where everything he knew and had was gone his home his family his possessions i'm sure david was tired exhausted discouraged without hope dreading with worry and fear on if he'll ever see his family again or if he's about to get killed by all these men threatening to stone him the people that he once led the people that had promoted him to be commander of their whole entire group are now talking about killing him because of everything that had happened they were probably telling him yo this is all your fault you're the reason we lost everything this happened because of you and when all these things back david up against the wall and as he looked around and saw nothing but destruction happening around him what did he do did he look at his current situation and say all right well i guess this is it figure out what we do from here did he give up did he run away to avoid the rumors of his stoning was he trying to avoid that no when all seemed lost and nothing around him could strengthen him david went to the one person where he knew he could find strength the bible says that david strengthened himself in the lord his god he refused to allow the current circumstances to be the reality of his life he made the decision to not accept what has just happened to be his final destiny but here david found himself in god's presence the bible says that david asked the lord this is important because it means he was talking with god and for us that's done through prayer and reading the bible right and so as david asked the lord as david was talking with god he strengthened himself in the lord and by strengthening himself in the lord god was realigning david back to the will of god and when david asked should i chase after this band of raiders will i catch them notice that he was asking god for guidance right the the other men reacted in a way where they blamed everybody see david didn't go to god and say why did you do this why did you let this happen to me how could you let this be what am i supposed to do now david said god this is all going on should i do this what should i do in this situation and when david asked god answered when what you once had was taken from you by the enemy when it feels like it was your fault or maybe people are saying it's your fault when you wonder if you'll ever get that thing back when nothing around you can offer you encouragement or strength that there's more for your life than what you're facing now my question to you church is where are you running to where are you finding that strength from where are you finding encouragement from because i want to let you know that in these moments when all is lost there is literally only one place we can go to find that strength and that's in the presence of god amen and when you go to him in prayer and when you go to him in need he is faithful to answer you the bible says in psalms 34 4 that i prayed to the lord and he answered me he freed me from all my fears so how was it that david believed he could recover everything the enemy has stolen even in the midst of the situation where all seemed lost it's because he went to god found strength in god and he asked and god answered and god told him you will surely recover everything that was taken from you and this is important this is important right here because if god says something will happen it's going to happen it doesn't matter how our circumstances look it doesn't matter about all the impossibilities we might face or what the enemy has stolen if god says it's gonna happen it will happen and here's what i mean if god's word says who the sun sets free is free indeed you can have your freedom back if god's word says that by his stripes we are healed you can have your health back if his word says that weeping may stay overnight but joy comes in the morning church you can have your joy back and if his word says to trust in him in all of your ways and he will make your path straight if you feel lost i'm telling you can find clarity you can get your clarity back because when god speaks it that is our reality no matter what life is looking like and this is why david was strengthened because he recognized this that the god who created the whole entire universe told him that you will surely recover everything that was taken from you but this is where it gets a little difficult right because we hear that we're like all right god's gonna make it happen you know it's all good but god said what will happen but he told david to go after them god said what the result would be but he told david you will go god said this is what's going to happen but you're going to take action david could not just wait and sit for things to come back to him david had to move he had to go after the enemy camp and he had to take back what the enemy has stolen david has to take action so verse 9 shows that david did just that first samuel 39 says so david and his 600 men set out and they came to the brook besour but 200 of the men were too exhausted across the brook so david continued to pursue with 400 men these were the same men that wanted a stone david guys this was the same man that wanted this dude dead and so it's clear here that david has some work to do right first things first he probably had to gather any remaining resource he had from the journey back any weapons he might have had from the journey back and on top of that he had to go to his men regain the trust that he somehow lost and get them on board to what god was getting ready to do david had to move he had to take action and god enables and prepares us to take action to take back what the enemy has stolen but it's not enough for us to just know what we need to do and how we need to do it we gotta actually take action we have to put in the effort because while god will make things happen the effort has to come from our end and so david took action in two ways the first is he rallied the things and the people in his life that would move him forward to where god was leading him and in our lives we need to do the same we need to take action by adding the routines and the habits in our lives that lead us toward where god is leading to that leads us back into taking that thing we need people in our lives too that will walk with us as well that when we're facing the low moments in our lives that they're willing to challenge us to lead us to help us to push us towards the promises of god so number one he had he took action by grabbing everything he could that would lead him further but two we see in verse 10 that he also needed to leave behind some things he needed to leave behind some people that were only holding him back the men that couldn't continue the men that were too exhausted had to stay behind and truthfully as long as david stayed with them he would not be able to cross the brook to take back what the enemy had stolen they held him back from taking action in church there are people there are things there are habits in our lives that only hold us back from taking action imagine if david left the 400 men who were ready just to stay with the 200 who was tired he wouldn't get anywhere david had to leave behind the people that only held him back and we need to make the decision to leave behind the things and people that do the same for us we have to take action and so david left behind the 200 men and he pursued to find the amalekites this is the awesome part about this story that on our way they run into this egyptian man who was just stranded and it turns out this egyptian man was a slave to one of the amalekites turns out that three days prior he got sick and so his master left him out to die he was just like just left them until david came along and david had some food and david had some water and david fed him and gave him something to drink why is this important it's because this egyptian man knew the exact route of where the amalekites were headed and through an agreement that they had with david he said that he would lead david and his men to the amalekites so what should have been a journey of wandering trying to find these people god had appointed a situation where the egyptian man led them exactly where he needed to be and this is what the bible says happened first samuel 30 starting at verse 16. so he led david to them the egyptian man and they found the amalekites spread out across the fields eating and drinking and dancing with joy because of the vast amount of plumber they had taken from the philistines in the land of judah david and his men rushed in among them and slaughtered them throughout that night and the entire next day until evening none of the amalekites escaped except 400 young men who fled on camels david got back everything everybody say everything david got back everything the amalekites had taken and he rescued his two wives nothing was missing smaller great son our daughter nor anything else that had been taken david brought everything back he also recovered all the flocks and herds and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock this plunder belongs to david they said so this egyptian man leads them right to the malachi camp and they found the amalekites spread out jumping for joy because they yo they just stole so many things they had all these things in their possessions and so how did they celebrate they start dancing like crazy eating like crazy and drinking like crazy now i'm not an expert on war or preparing for war or getting yourself ready for battle but i think i can make a fair assumption in saying that the last thing you probably want to do before getting into battle is eating a whole ton and drinking the whole time am i right you know you're probably not going to be in the best shape to fight if you do that and so in this situation for the amalekites it's terrible but for david and his men church this is automatic victory and so what happens david and his men rush in and they fought for a whole 24 hours to get back everything the enemy had stolen there was not one thing missing and on top of that there was surplus and because david encouraged himself in the lord because he strengthened himself in the lord because david took action david recovered worshipping you can come on up david got back everything the bible says that there was nothing missing small or great that every son and daughter was was taken back nor anything else that has been taken was lost everything was taken back not only that like i said david got surplus that livestock the amalekites were holding on to he took that too and i love this story because what started as a tragic moment of loss and hopelessness ended with the promises of god coming to pass the promise that you will surely recover everything that has been taken from you so church if something's been taken from you maybe it feels like all has been taken from you when you feel like your life's in shambles when you ever wonder if you'll get that thing back the enemy stole when it feels like the enemy's leaping for joy celebrating like the amalekites were because of what he stole from you i urge you church to strengthen yourself in the lord to take action because you will recover it's probably not going to be immediate right david had a journey and travel and prepare and plan and do a whole bunch and on top of that when it came to the moment of fighting he fought for a whole entire day and that's a long time well no matter how long it takes keep fighting because you will surely recover everything the enemy has told me let's stand [Music] so joanna and i uh when we got married we began to do this thing we did like every year um and it was coming up with a word or a phrase of the year it was like the principle we held on to whenever things got tough or whenever we lacked motivation like that was the thing we went back to and for 2021 our word was breakthrough we believe that we were going to have breakthrough in every every way in every way and in 2021 yeah we had breakthrough it was a great great year for us and towards the end we started planning for our phrase for 2022 and it was new levels like i was like 2022 is gonna be the year where i elevate where god elevates me it's gonna be great and there's this cliche thing that every time you hit a new level you hit a new devil and it's as true as cliche like literally like it's i hate to say it [Music] and it was crazy because as i anticipated 2022 what i thought would be a year of nothing but new levels came nothing but new difficulties and new challenges just to start off the year perfectly i got coping it's pretty high fever all that bad stuff crazy but what really messed me up was that right after i recovered from covid i was immediately hit with this anxiety that i've never felt or dealt with before it was so bad that at one point for three weeks straight i woke up feeling anxious and i literally felt anxious for every single second of that day until i went to bed the only times i didn't feel anxious when i was dreaming and even in my dreams i had some anxious dreams for a whole three weeks it it was really really messed up and it like was really distracting me from being able to do my regular damn routine because it's so hard to focus when you just have that feeling itching away at you day after day after day and my anxiety brought worry and my worry brought discouragement my discouragement brought lies and my lies brought questions and i found myself beat up discouraged and if i can be honest with you here today without joy i tried i did my thing i did my routines but i just ended the day feeling the same way defeated discouraged without joy why am i saying all this it's because church discernment isn't just a message for you i believe god put this in my heart that's a message for me and i don't know about you but this year the devil the enemy has stolen some things from me and i i think it's time we take it back i think it's time we take it back [Music] the enemy may have taken my piece but i'm getting my piece back the enemy may have taken my joy but i'm getting my joy back he may have taken my confidence but church i'm getting my confidence back and i want to let you know right now in this room that whatever the enemy has taken from you you're getting it back so this morning church i invite you to the altar here let this altar not just be a place where you normally come to a meet with god but let it be a place where you say god i'm strengthening myself for you let it be a place where you make the decision to take action to go into the enemy's camp to take back what's yours and today let's make the decision to take back what the enemy has stolen from us because god is saying to us go after it because you will surely recover everything that was taken so i invite you to the altar as we sing this last song [Music]", "so apparently they have games and kids church so maybe that's an addition we should add down here so um yeah that'd be awesome actually the uh so if you're interested in kids ministry please talk to our kids ministry director you can go to the church Center app find out more information you can talk to one of the staff or another kids ministry volunteer if you'd like to know more about it or like to check it out on a Sunday morning or Wednesday night or any of our other programs that we do hey just uh just to make those of you that have been around a while particularly those of you that were around 20 years ago all the teenagers that were in that video weren't even alive when we started the church so there you go enjoy that for the day um today is really part two of last week and it starts with Isaiah chapter 64. last week we started oh that you would Rend the heavens and come down the mountains would tremble before you first two and when fire sets Twigs Ablaze and causes water to boil come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the Nations to Quake before you there's this idea of fire the fire of Heaven okay the fire of Heaven God coming down the fire of heaven and what it accomplishes amongst us the fire is a funny thing um most of us take fire for granted it happens all the time around us if you have a gas heater you know it turns on you don't think much about it if you have a gas stove it turns on you don't think much about it but if you're in the woods and you're freezing and you have one match and it's pouring rain or snow or something and you need to start a fire to save your life all of a sudden fire becomes really important fire becomes super important I actually know how to start a fire in the woods in the pouring rain or freezing with just one match and you're like oh anybody could do that it's actually a little harder than you might think you know I when I was younger I went through the we had this thing called royal Rangers in the church that I grew up in basically it was Boy Scouts like but Sunday School Boy Scouts so it's a little bit different and we spent a lot of time at church going outside and starting fires and this is what we did and then somehow this was supposed to point us to Jesus I don't know quite how it all worked out because I don't really think there was much Jesus talk going on it was just a lot of starting fires and throwing knives is what it was so but it was great we learned how to do it today I want you to think about the fire of heaven and we're going to talk about Three Fires of heaven today the Three Fires of Heaven and the first one may not be all that exciting the first one that we see is the fire of judgment from Heaven comes the fire of judgment throughout scripture particularly in the Old Testament if you found complaining people that were complaining a lot to God sometimes fire would come and snatch them up it was pretty rough last week's story in First Kings chapter 18 this encounter between God and Elijah and the prophets of Baal and the fire coming down consuming uh the sacrifice and the altar let me let me read this to you again we didn't get all of it last week verse 36 at the usual time for offering the evening sacrifice Elijah the prophet walked up to the Altar and prayed O Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob prove today that you are God in Israel that I am your servant prove that I have done all this at your command oh Lord answer me answer me so these people will know that You O Lord are God and that you have brought them back to yourself immediately the fire of the Lord flashed down from heaven watch that the fire of the Lord flashed down from heaven burned up the young bull the wood the stones and the dust it even licked up all the water in the trench so if you missed it last week There's this encounter going on between the false god bail and the true God the god of Israel and this is the encounter moment where God shows up and when all the people saw it they fell face down on the ground and cried out the Lord he is God yes the Lord is God then Elijah commanded we didn't read this part last week that Elijah commanded sees all the prophets of Baal don't let a single one Escape so that people seize them all and Elijah took them down to the kishan valley and killed them there end of story what what just happened well what just happened was God's judgment came severely ferociously and quickly upon these false prophets just just executed them you can't get away from it you can't get around it that's what happened and I want you to catch this today when God tears open the heavens there is a consequence there is a great sense of our sin or a great rejection of God we either accept and repent or reject and rebel sin when God shows up sin is either repented of or sin is judged and some people responded you'll see they fell down on their faces and they cried out uh that the Lord is God some people responded by crying out to God in awe in reverence and repentance that's always the right response by the way but there were other people that had perpetuated the lies upon the people those that had previously been tools of the wicked Empire they are now judged severely by God just just to be clear both the people and the power Brokers had sinned Grievous grievously all of them had sinned all of them had violated the laws of God all of them were desperately wicked so don't think osun were good guys and some were bad guys they were all desperately wicked and as through shown throughout the scriptures God is always merciful to the repentant but he must judge the corrupt and rebellious you cannot have true Mercy without True Justice and you cannot have True Justice without Mercy this is the nature of the fire of God coming down judgment and mercy like I said that's not everybody's favorite one right there judgment because I think if we're being honest in the Deep places the things we don't really talk about but we know we're wrong sometimes we in honest moments recognize I haven't really repented of that I really have made a lot of excuses as to why I've really held on to it because I like it and so the concept of judgment is a little terrifying to most people that are being honest and so this is a good reminder when we call out for the fire of God for God to show up there needs to be a moment of repentance we just sang three songs this morning every one of them is a spiritual warfare themed song all of them have this idea behind it of we are at Battle we are Waging War we are stepping on the head of Satan you know this is not light language right you know Romans 16 19 the God of Peace will soon Crush Satan underneath your feet like we're going to step on the head of Satan woohoo you better repent first or he's going to bite you and grab you and bring you down okay so judgment the second fire of Heaven that we're going to talk about today is the fire of refining the fire of refining the fire of God is a refining fire it consumes the dross the junk the bad stuff the dirt uh the the garbage in our life much like Precious Metals like gold or silver when they are being refined in a fire they are placed in the fire and you'll notice when it's put in all this stuff Burns around it and what's burning is the stuff that's not supposed to be there the stuff that is impure notice this passage from Zechariah chapter 13. it says I will bring that group through the fire and make them pure people like the idea of being made pure we don't love the idea of going through the fire I will refine them like silver purify them like gold they will call on my name I will answer them I will say these are my people and they will say The Lord Is Our God the don't miss this today when God shows up his fire shows up and the little things in your life are confronted and our lives begin to be taken care of people that were once careless begin to become concerned about even the slightest inconsistencies in our life as God 's presence begins to refine them this refining fire removes the the dead wood in your life the pruning of Our Lives the chaff and the and the duff that ever persistent weeds in your life simply begin to disappear when God comes down all that is evil or opposed to him begins to become consumed this sounds exciting and scary and terrifying and awesome inspiring all at the same time something goes on when God shows up now there are certain spiritual disciplines that can act in our life like the fire of God that will refine us I want you to pay very close attention to this today sometimes the fire of God shows up like a rushing Mighty Wind and it shows up people call out to God and the fire of God shows up an exciting and powerful and terrifying way but sometimes the fire of God shows up in another way it shows up through the word of God and through the execution of those spiritual disciplines in our life now that's much less romantic to say than a rushing Mighty Wind but they both are the fire of God for example I'm going to give you a couple examples today for example the spiritual discipline of not gossiping the spiritual discipline of not gossiping of not gossiping not gossiping but not gossiping James chapter one if you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue you are fooling yourselves and your religion is worthless we call gossip a lot of different things and the Bible says by the way a ton to say about gossip it's actually one of the very few things in the Bible that it says to kick people out of church for that if they won't stop gossiping just get rid of them turn them over to Satan for a season oh this must be serious then okay this is one of the things that like gossipers and inheriting the kingdom of heaven those two things don't happen so it's a big deal in Scripture so to learn to not gossip is complicated in the U.S we call a gossip a lot of different things spilling the tea gossip the dirt the low down the shade talking trash or reporting sometimes called the news in America is Gossip most of it we even have set we say things like have you heard guess what you'll never guess what happened you'll never guess what I heard I need to Spill the Beans I can't keep this to myself let's chat over coffee sometime we have a whole bunch of set up so that we can gossip Jen and I we're on some Island and I can't even remember the name of uh on sabbatical and we walk up this hill large Hill to this this giant church that seems like it could not possibly be there but some world famous leader from like 700 built it and outside the church all of these uh Greek ladies it was in Greece and then they would go in and then they would come back out and they would go in and come back out and the guide said this is a very unique thing that's happening here they're coming to gossip they come they sit and they gossip all day long about each other about what's happening about it but because they do it in the church they feel like God sees it so it must be okay that's funny and really really messed up really really messed up in a world and in a culture where is there's this constant echo of Gossip all the time we have to ask ourselves how do we how do we clarify our speech how do we make sure that we talk about the things that are appropriate to talk about and eliminate the things that are not appropriate to talk about if you really really really want to execute this well the answer or the antidote comes immediately after this passage it comes in verse 27. where it says pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the father means caring for Orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you so if you want an if you're like if you're just a gabber if you just love to talk and tell everybody the tea and all this kind of stuff what it means is you don't have a life purpose you don't have something that's so important in your life that you don't have time to gossip you got too much time on your hands and so scriptures here saying do good stuff in the midst of the chaos of this world so that you don't need to tell me what the the what's going on we all know the world is corrupted and that people do stupid things we all already know that we we try to create new ways to mess things up we know it happens it's not breaking news to find out that somebody messed up instead choose to be a light in the darkness a place of Refuge in the storm an outpost of Hope in a hopeless situation if you are so occupied being light a refuge a pace of hope you are in that moment experiencing a refining fire in your life that burns the nonsense off of your life you won't have time you won't have the emotional energy you will just have to let it burn up because the holy spirit's working in you to do these other good things because you are too missionally focused and Purpose Driven to get entangled in the ick and muck and mire of this world any longer that's why the discipline of it is important sometimes when we go hiking we'll be a couple miles up in the mountain and then you'll notice something kind of tucked off on the trail and what it is is it's oftentimes a stash of things that a previous hiker realized they didn't want to carry anymore because it was too heavy and so in theory they hope to grab it on the way out the weight of carrying the unnecessary things on the trail like when you're way over packed it can mess up your hips and your knees and and it can mess up your ankles it can mess up your toes it can mess up everything so people will sometimes realize their mistake in carrying all these unnecessary things and they'll get rid of them friends that's a good idea when you're going through this life trying to follow Jesus and you have unnecessary things sometimes the best habit is just get rid of them living a healthy and whole life that honors God in order to achieve the goal that he has for us means you can't carry the unnecessary things you must set them aside so that you can achieve the higher things in your life the higher things that God has purposed for you to do but if you are too caught up in the the muck of this life you will never get to where God wants you you will be stuck at the level you are at when God wants you to be ten levels higher so that's like that discipline of of not gossiping or the the Holy Spirit the fire of the Holy Spirit uses to refine you and that takes a lot what I just said that's really hard to do or what about the discipline of generosity I'm going to read a passage from Mark chapter 10. uh a couple of times it's it's a little bit lengthy so follow along closely the discipline of generosity and connected to the fire of God refining you as Jesus started out on his way to Jerusalem a man came running up to him knelt down and asked good teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life how do I get to heaven how do I get the stuff you're talking about good question why do you call me good Jesus asked only God is truly good but to answer your question you know the Commandments you must not murder commit adultery not steal not testify falsely you must not cheat anyone honor your father and mother teacher the man replied I've obeyed all these Commandments since I was young ding ding ding liar 21 looking at the man Jesus felt genuine love for him there is still one thing you haven't done he told him wait for it Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me at this the man's face fell he went away sad for he had many possessions think about this for a second Jesus identifies that this young man although relatively righteous Jesus could tell he had another God that money was his real God money wealth things Comfort pleasure security had taken captive his heart and Jesus could see it and he said get rid of it all and come follow me verse 23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God this amazed them but Jesus said again dear children it is very hard to enter the kingdom of God in fact it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God the disciples were astounded then who in the world can be saved they asked Jesus looked at them intently and said humanly speaking it is impossible but not with God everything is possible with God then Peter began to speak up we've given up everything to follow you he said yes Jesus replied and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property for my sake and for the good news will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses brothers sisters mothers children and property along with persecution you get all this stuff and persecution oh thanks Jesus and in the world to come that person will have eternal life that many who are the greatest now will be the least important then and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then this is one of the great passages in mark this this whole this whole uh dialogue this whole discussion the setup the story the encounter with the rich man the discussion with the disciples there is so much here that is so so relevant for Americans today we're the wealthiest people in the world even if you feel poor you're still one of the wealthiest people in the world in America the story of the Rich Young Ruler though doesn't end there it wasn't a parable it was an actual encounter and there's a few things for you to think about to consider Jesus was not scolding the wealthy men don't misunderstand it he wasn't scolding him he was refining him he was inviting him to be his disciple literally at the end he said and come follow me he was inviting him to be a follower and Jesus was making it clear if you're gonna really follow me just give it all up Jesus had a purpose and a plan for this man and we know from church history that this Rich Young Ruler eventually did what Jesus asked he became a fully devoted follower of Jesus his name was Mark as in the title of the book that we're reading from he wrote the Gospel of Mark and he's the one telling the story here a lot of people missed that part because it's not in the Bible it's just something from church history the discipline of relieving himself of the burden of his wealth was the refining fire that he needed for his heart to be pure towards Jesus Jesus knew it Mark knew it because all things are possible with God Mark ends up being one of the great followers of Jesus in history so the extra ction of spiritual disciplines things that we see in the Bible that are hard to do that we need to put into practice it's the executing of those things that God uses as a refining fire in our life because in order to be generous you have to get rid of other stuff in your life if you notice that it's kind of complicated to be as generous as you want to be unless you let go of stuff or certain things and you choose missional uh intentionality instead the third thing the third fire of Heaven that we're going to notice today is the fire of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is fire John the Baptist said in in the Book of Matthew chapter 3 I baptize you with water for repentance but after me comes one who is more powerful than I whose sandals I am not worthy to carry he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire his winnowing fork in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor Gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire the holy spirit's Ministry is equated in the Bible with fire fire in the Holy Spirit go hand in hand and Paul even said one of the biblical authors said that we can quench the fire of the Holy Spirit we can put it out if we don't like it so that we aren't refined when God sends the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit blazes upon people and when the fire of the holy spirit is burning within you it compels you it compels you to act and believe in faith for impossible things when you are filled with the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit is blazing within you in fire you don't be like hey I'm just going to do regular life that's going to be ordinary nothing's going to change that's not how it plays out how it plays out is you feel compelled to believe in faith for impossible things suddenly you find yourself praying for the sick to be healed you find yourself praying for spiritually captive people to be free you find yourself praying for those that are oppressed by demonic spirits to be released and delivered you find yourself praying for authentic miracles to take place and you discover that when you act in faith or ask in faith compelled by the burning fire of the Holy Spirit things begin to change around you Hebrews chapter 11 says faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen we'll say it again I'll let the Bible say it faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen that's what faith is believing it'll actually happen it gives us Assurance about things we cannot see we talk about God all the time around here you can't see him that's faith he so when Jesus says in Mark chapter 9 verse 23 anything is possible if a person believes or has faith what he's doing is he's shouting Through the Ages to all who align themselves with his kingdom to us and become fully devoted followers that nothing is impossible nothing is impossible that's why Isaiah 53 says when we are prophetically told but he was pierced for our Rebellion crushed for our sins he was beaten so we could be whole he was whipped so we could be healed you see this connection that we could act in faith on that promise that's why Jesus reminds us in Mark 11 I tell you you can pray for anything and if you believe that you received it it will be yours this is some of the this particular passage is one of the more difficult passages in Scripture I've read not an exaggeration dozens and dozens of books about this passage of scripture most of them try to explain it away for real they're like Well it can't possibly mean what it says well friends we don't get to do that with the Bible you can try you shouldn't it says Jesus I tell you you can pray for anything and if you believe that you've received it it will be yours now there's all kinds of connections and and setups to that so it does mean a bit more than what it seems to be a safe face value but at the end it means absolutely exactly what it says Jesus is saying if you follow me you are a person of Faith you have the faith I am compelling you to do this and to do impossible things Jesus told us that we would do even greater things than he did which requires Mark 11 24 to be true several years ago so you know this but several years ago I bought a brand new couch it was a nice couch a leather couch and it had some reclining seats on it you know it's great went home and told the girls that we had just purchased a brand new couch okay girls we purchased a brand new couch they come running downstairs to the living room and all they see is a stinky old couch they looked at me like I thought you said we had a new couch I said we do you just can't see it yet well this predicament is a little bit like faith and believing it is true that I purchased a couch I possessed the receipt I possessed the specifications for the couch so I knew exactly where it would fit in my house I even had the warranty certificate for the couch I had the cleaning kit that comes with the couch but I did not have possession of the couch I owned the couch it just was not in my possession yet we had to wait for a call from a delivery truck driver to let us know that the couch was on its way to the house when we got the call we had to pick up the phone or return the call to give permission for them to bring it then in order to have it installed I have to have the old couch removed and then they finally installed the couch and I finally possessed the couch see how that worked a lot of steps to get a couch in my house did I own the couch yes did I possess the couch no did I possess the promise of the couch that it would be mine it would transfer to me at some point from the kind of ethos into an actual real thing in my house yes well faith and belief work in a very similar way when you are compelled by the fire of the Holy Spirit to pray for someone or something in faith in that moment that you begin to pray in faith you possess the receipt the promise of that prayer to that prayer in that moment that you birthed the beginnings of the Fulfillment of that promise in the invisible so to speak that will eventually become realized in real life or our everyday life in other words you own it you just don't possess it yet and the reason this isn't important is the worship team comes up the reason this is important is because there are things that we can do that prevent the transfer of the actual possession you have to follow the instructions that God gives you have to overcome the opposition of the enemy to that transfer you've got to get rid of the old junk in your life the old couches that don't belong there anymore the stuff that's in the way of the new life and finally you must receive and accept that answer to prayer that you have prayed in faith believing it's a process there are three fires Three Fires of Heaven that we talked about today judgment the fire of judgment the refining fire and the fire of the Holy Spirit these are all extremely important would you stand with me as we close please would you just close your eyes and bow your heads throughout the room we this this covered a lot of ground this morning and I'm aware of how this works the spirit of God speaks to us all differently in it about different things that are particularly important for you today and so God's spirit is connecting with you today about something and I want to give you a chance to respond to that whatever it happens to be maybe you're just being inspired by God's spirit to let him lead you and you have a very specific thing that you need to come and surrender to God today maybe as the spirit of God [Music] Falls in your life today maybe there's an a response that is either I'm rejecting this or I'm repenting of this today maybe there's things like the simple execution or seemingly simple spiritual disciplines that you need to to go through to let the Holy Spirit be a refining fire in your life [Music] wherever it is and however it is you need to respond today as the worship team leads us in this would you just respond respond to God invite is fire to fall in your life today the altars are open if you'd like to spend some time in prayer", "[Music] [Applause] hey friends i'm pastor dave and i want to welcome you to our week of prayer and fasting i am so excited to get to pray with you this week and i want to let you know that every day this week we will be releasing a clip like the one you're watching now where we'll be able to spend some time together praying for specific needs anytime that i'm doing something important i always want to make sure that i have the right tools and i want to let you know about three tools that are absolutely essential number one the most important tool is your bible and if you don't have one download the youversion bible app it is a free app it is awesome has a ton of resources that are available right at your fingertips as much as god wants to hear from us we want to hear from him i also want to let you know about our website which is ecic dot tv slash wowpath as in week of prayer and fasting if you go on there there are some incredible resources that will equip you throughout this week we'll be challenging you to pray outside the box so go check that out it is there for you it is available with just a click of a button number two i would encourage you to find a space to meet with god and if you're a person who likes to meet with god in your car to or from work make sure that you meet with god in your car or perhaps there's a room in your house where you can you know go and find peace and spend some time meditating on the word of god or maybe you're someone who you know god likes to meet you out in nature maybe you'll go on the side of a mountain or on a hike or just a walk in the woods whatever that looks like for you just the idea is that be intentional about that last but not least i would encourage you to get a journal some a place where you can write down the things that are on your heart having a journal just gives us a space where we can filter our thoughts and lay our our intentions before god and invite him to sort them out and to give us clarity i cannot tell you how awesome it is to be able to have a journal where you know you hold on to the promises of god okay since this is day one i want to let you know what our theme is for this week of prayer and fasting breaking strongholds and specifically strongholds in the lives of our friends and family members who are far from god and there's a verse that is actually catapulting at this theme for us and it is in second corinthians 4 4 this is what it says it says satan who is the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't believe now watch this they are unable all right so the enemy has blinded them and so they are unable to see the glorious light of the good news they don't understand this message about the glory of christ who is the exact likeness of god the idea here is that you and i know friends and family members right now who are far from god and we would love to see them come close to god to recognize the freedom that is in christ but there is something in the way they are unable to see you know many times when we share our faith it isn't that people are necessarily opposed to our faith it isn't necessarily that you know they're always anti whatever we are sharing with them or that they don't want god but this scripture lets us know that there is something that we cannot see there is a struggle and god is fighting on behalf of your friends your loved ones god wants them to know jesus but we have to fight we're in a spiritual battle where the outcome is partially decided by the prayers that we pray and so we get to pray that's the bottom line and as we pray we are going to be fasting this week so that these strongholds that keep people from being able to see the light of jesus will come crumbling down there are things that will not happen there are situations that will not change in our lives unless we pray unless we press in and ask god to intervene miraculously no matter how impossible the situation may seem right now let's pray right now together as we open up this week heavenly father we want to take this moment now to thank you for the opportunity that we have to come before your throne to pray together to invite you into these circumstances this week as we are setting aside something in our lives to make more room for you will you challenge us would you lift up our eyes and our focus towards you god we bring these needs in these situations we bring our family and our friends before you god we want to see strongholds being broken we want to see the strongholds of the enemy falling to the ground shattering under your presence and so god we need you there are situations that are simply overwhelming impossible there are things in our lives that desperately need your intervention otherwise they will not change and there's nothing we can do in our own strength we recognize that we invite you we call out to you and we know that you are good that you will hear us in our time of need god that when we turn to you we know that you welcome us and you empower us so god here we are right at the beginning asking you to show up miraculously and we are expecting great things because you're a great god and you can do what nobody else can do so thank you and we look forward to seeing these strongholds being broken and lives being changed and people coming to know about how good you are and how awesome you are and how beautiful you are in jesus name we pray amen [Music] i will see you here tomorrow god bless", "[Applause] all right good morning everyone morning good to see you here today we uh we're continuing our series called the rule which is this idea that Jesus is establishing the the rule for his kingdom not like this is not like the Ten Commandments like a list of rules but kind this is the ethos of his kingdom this is what actually occurs inside of his kingdom and this is what it means to be part of his kingdom and so we're back onto the hillside with several thousand people and Jesus is talking to this group of people now to make sure that you understand where we're at we're at a season in uh in history when Israel is being uh ruled and governed uh they are being oppressed by the uh the Roman government at this time and uh for the most part these people on the side of the mountain for the most part are a gentle people for the most part they weren't causing a lot of problems they were like I said in captivity to this foreign Nation uh they were not openly rioting in the streets at least not yet anyhow but the truth is deep inside they wanted to kill all the Romans they wanted to destroy them all because they were being oppressed by them you have to keep that in mind when when Jesus is talking to them because again Jesus is making a really clear distinction between their Kingdom that they live in and his kingdom that he's inviting them to be part of he's he's drawing these these lines in the sand these these culture uh uh uh uh moments to make sure and so he's gone through a lot of these so far and he comes to this moment and Jesus says in Matthew chapter 5:9 blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the sons of God blessed are the peacemakers so that's what we're talking about today the rule inside the kingdom of God is that the peacemakers are the sons of God the peacemakers are the the daughters of God here's what peacemakers do and some of this is going to make a lot of sense today and others of this is going to like rub you the wrong way it's going to be like really am I really supposed to do that and answer's yes you're really supposed to do that peacemakers bring peace to tumultuous situations to complicated difficult situations there's this moment in my lifetime and uh not all of your lifetimes but in my lifetime back in 1993 there was this kind of interesting world history moment where the prime minister of Israel Rabin said to the PLO leader after he had talked about all the hostility that was happening between Israel and the Palestinians this is 1993 not today he he says to the PLO enough I say to you PLO enough enough enough enough Bloodshed enough tears and then they shook hands and it was very much the handshake seen across the world it was not expected it was unusual it was was like a a glimmer of potential hope and as we know today uh if peace when peace is established um you have to tend to that peace uh it doesn't just stay uh uh neutral forever so where there are angers or think of Jesus talking like this where there's angers or where there's rumors where there's slandering where there's distrust where there is division there can't be peace in those places while those things continue to happen and so let's just say today that enough is enough be a peacemaker in your family be a peacemaker with your peers be a peacemaker with your co-workers be a peacemaker in your city reconcile your battles your Wars with others for the sake of Jesus and his kingdom because blessed are the peacemakers they are the sons of God the Israel Palestinian issue as we know um is as complicated today as it's ever been it's as devastating today as it's ever been and it's hard to see a Way Forward on peace but blessed are the peacemakers being a peacemaker is not just fostering a lack of conflict however it's not just causing a a troubled and difficult situation to stop being uh Angry being a peacemaker is not just about having no conflict not just one who settles disagreements not just one who rolls over not just one who uh is just seeking whatever absence of conflict is possible a Biblical Peacemaker is one who brings God's will into human situations that's what a Biblical Peacemaker is God God's will into human situations this is called bringing the Shalom of God or the peace of God into the moment and catch this for you today if you've ever wondered what God's will is for your life I'm about to tell you God's will for your life and mine is that first you be reconciled to God and second that you be one who reconciles other people to God at the core of who it is that you're supposed to be that's who you're supposed to be be reconciled to God and reconcile others to God that's being a Biblical Peacemaker it's not God's will for one person to hurt another person it's not God's will for lwd sexual behavior or conversations to take place it's not God's will for your mind to be filled with garbage from all the inputs of the world it's not God's will for families to be destroyed by alcohol or drugs or unresolved issues from the past or outbursts of anger or unforgiveness and bitterness if you're going to accept the mission from God you will have to establish yourself as a warrior of sorts part of God's enlisted Special Forces team you might say that a Biblical Peacemaker is a compassionate Warrior who uses exclusively spiritual weapons that's a whole lot of words right there that's complicated stuff but true peace can only come from being in a right relationship with God think about this uh think about when you have a fight or a disagreement with a friend or a spouse and there's something missing in your heart in that moment when you're not in a right relationship with them maybe you're tense or uncomfortable or awkward or unable to sleep see you can only be a true Peacemaker when you are living at peace with God and when you are bringing God's will into human situations it's not just about not having conflict which will lead to these kind of vacancies and voids it's about bringing God's will in sometimes and perhaps even most times bringing God's will into human situations actually can cause conflict which is an odd moment when you're thinking about being a peacemaker because your your goal is to reconcile yourself with God and others to God so peacemakers also seek first to understand and then to be understood it's a common idea but God models peacemaking for us by extending a hand to his enemies first you see we are the enemies of God we were the enemies of God and God extends to us his son Jesus he he lays it down first for us God set that perfect example of this for us in Jesus in the midst of a great conflict a war between man and God God decides that he loves us in spite of our wrong and offers not just a peace treaty but in fact a fully restored relationship that's biblical peacemaking it's a a winwin situation for both God and man the only one that loses is the devil that situation peacemakers are also people of action and today I would like us to especially take a look at bringing peace to situations where conflict has arisen between those in your life between those that you are closest to your your brothers and sisters in Christ whether family or friends what are you supposed to do when someone causes harm to you or causes harm to your reputation or causes harm to your name maybe it's physically or emotionally or spiritually what is bringing peace into that situation look like what is it how do you actually handle real world conflict on a day-to-day basis Jesus addresses this issue he actually makes a peacemaking plan for us to follow it's actually found it's a four-step process found in Matthew 18 Matthew 18:15 says this if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you how many two of you that's you as one they as the other okay that's two if he listens to you you have won your brother over but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three Witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector I tell you the truth whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth will be loosed in heaven Matthew chapter 18:15 is uh loaded with extremely important information so if you want to know how do I actually go about making peace with somebody this is it step one there you go you don't even have to take notes because it's in Matthew chapter 18:1 15 you can just go back and look in private go and talk to the person that you feel has sinned against you uh remember you might be wrong maybe they didn't remember that but in private go and talk to them and the goal is not to defeat them the goal is not to demean them it's not to take the other person and just list out everything that's horrible about them as a human being rather it is to be in a restored relationship with them to restore them to Christ and to you now that's not normally the way we handle conflict but that is exactly what Jesus asked us to do and he's establishing that is his kingdom this is how things operate it seems kind kind of easy like just to say hey go talk to somebody but we all know it's not that easy most people would do almost anything to avoid confronting another person it is not our nature to love to confront in fact somebody say somebody say confront confront okay some of you are having high level heightened anxiety just saying the word confront right confront is not your favorite thing to do in private in person see we we create all these these new ways to try to confront people on the side and sideways which are all entirely unhealthy the sound of the word confront is enough to really mess with you why don't people confront uh because it can be costly it's not fun but sometimes it's really painful and it's difficult to sit in those moments so if you've ever ask yourself why do I keep avoiding a difficult conversation with somebody that's why that's why but what happens when people don't deal what happens if you don't do what it is that Jesus says that we're supposed to do what happens if you don't deal with it in a Biblical manner well this is what happens Facebook happens um gossiping slandering talking behind other people's backs trying to get people to pick sides and take sides and by this time the story is almost nothing remotely close to what actually happened it turns into frustration I you you've been venting and you've been rehearsing and you've been it's going through your mind a hundred times then a thousand times and it's getting worse and worse and worse now now you're into a space of condemning and hating and being bitter because you gave yourself a pass and you said well I'm just G to let I'm just going to let some time go by let me I'm going to clear my head because that works so well but instead of clearing your head what started as an ember of offense now becomes a raging fire in your spirit and then the Raging Fire is on you not on them that Raging Fire is your issue not their issue and so you can't bring that to the table now cuz that's not on them it was just an ember that you allowed to turn into a raging fire so you're like all right Pastor Kurt I see I see what you're saying this is horrible I was offended 18 years ago I need to go talk to this person it's too late 90% of the time that's too late not always but that's really honestly on a day-to-day basis too much time to let pass if you're not going to let something go you've got to be willing to go to that brother or sister and work the situation out in a timely manner timely doesn't mean six months from now timely means I have a plan by the end of the week and if for some reason that is no longer possible they've moved too far away or they've deceased or something like that then you've got to give it to Jesus and Let It Go go like is there another way to do it Pastor no there's no other way to do it you got to give it to Jesus and Let It Go Romans chapter 12 says if it is possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone so of course other parts of the scripture very clearly say that we're supposed to make allowances for one another this isn't telling you to be nitpicky with everybody because that's on you this is talking about higher level stuff so do your part and then move forward now in the majority of situations what we just talked about going and talking uh uh to your brother or sister in the majority of situations that is exactly uh what is going to happen is that they will be reconciled to you into Christ and if you take that step it'll be very good you'll kill the situation it doesn't have to be addressed anymore uh you you bury it so it doesn't pop up its ugly head again because because it's dead now but what happens if this doesn't take care of the situation what are you supposed to do but what happens if you gone and talked to the person and and it didn't work like I I thought you said it was going to be really easy Jesus right well Jesus says well sometimes that's not going to work and so you're going to have to take it up a notch and so what you do then is this you take it along two or three Witnesses not witnesses that saw what happened spiritual uh uh people that are spiritually mature that can observe your conversation to make sure that they can guide and navigate you through now step two and this is an important distinction in a local church context step two is where a lot of people try to pull in the pastors this is not where you're supposed to do that what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to bring in other mature Christians and you're supposed to allow them to speak into the situation and and try to bring a direction counsel and again peacemaking reconciliation to God and to each other I'm talking 95% of the time this is now resolved it is almost always taken care of by now but there are there are some stubborn folks out there there's some stubborn folks and sometimes step one doesn't work and step two doesn't work and then you go to step three at this point is where you bring in official help according to what Jesus is talking about he's going through the step by step by step and in a local church context that is in fact where you would ask a pastor to to come in and and help uh establish uh work on this situation now that does not mean that you have permission to go talking to everybody in the church about this like oh they didn't apologize to me they didn't repent we're not okay so I'm just going to tell the whole church everybody in the church exactly what's going on that's not that's not what Jesus is saying and so you go and you get into a more structured situation and that's where pastors can come in and help in the process and if that what happens if that doesn't work Jesus still still has a plan still has a plan because Jesus is extremely interested in peacemaking in people being reconciled to God and to each other and so he's not just giving up on people in the process he's like trying to make it so they have another chance so they have another chance so they have another chance and then what happens if step three doesn't work if they won't listen to anybody well step four Jesus said treat them as a pagan or a tax collector now that's really an interesting layout there because I'm sure on some level the people listening were like oh awesome we hate pagans and tax collectors like I can I can really spit on them I can be mean to him but in the kingdom of God we're supposed to love our enemies so what do you do after everything doesn't work how do you treat a pagan or a tax collector with love now love doesn't mean you just get a free pass it's a very extreme and very few cases it might mean that an individual is actually removed from the fellowship so that a time of repentance can occur the Bible talks about this and can I tell you this that in 33 years of pastoring I've only seen a have to come to that place about a dozen times and after that occurs the vast majority of time the people eventually have a moment of Awakening where the holy spirit is working on their heart and they have an aha moment oh this is what's going on now I need to be right with God and my fellow Believers so the vast majority of time I have seen this take place it works great the main point here is that when you have been offended the first course of action is to deal with the individual in a timely and and in uh a timely manner and privately now that sounds so simple maybe it didn't sound simple to you sounds simple to me but before we can even start this stuff we have to make sure we're okay that we're okay that we have the right attitude that we we are the compassionate Warrior that's using spiritual weapons and spiritual means instead of Earthly means we have to make sure that we are of correct attitude and not of a I'm going to get you kind of attitude so peacemakers the rule in a kingdom of God is that blessed are the peacemakers for they'll be called the sons of God peacemakers have to have the right attitude now immediately after Jesus speaks get this Jesus is talking about this this is really important stuff in Matthew 18 like how to deal with conflict how to deal with sin with a brother or sister immediately after Jesus is uh done talking about this how to deal with this Peter is in the crowd Matthew 18: 21 then Peter comes to Jesus and says Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times Jesus answered I tell you not seven times but 77 uh 77 times or really 70 times s get this Peter is hearing Jesus be really clear that he has to be open to forgiving people he sees the four-step plan but Peter is wise enough to get that what Jesus is really saying is you've got to be open to forgiveness and so now Peter ask a follow-up question trying to make sure he doesn't have to always forgive people okay that's what he's trying to do he's like okay a I I've been having a rough time with Judas recently uh Jesus and he's like really offending me we're like up to number six after seven can I be done with Judas that's what he's thinking okay and Jesus is like no it's not it at all forgiveness has to always be the open posture of our heart Jesus is laying out at the rule of his kingdom that it's not ever about defeating another person it's it's not about giving them one last chance it's about bringing the kingdom of God to Earth so that God's love and will his peace and Shalom can be brought to everyone it's always the big picture for Jesus remember remember that that person that you hate and if when I said that person you hate you knew exactly who you were thinking about or that person that you think is the greatest loser in the history of the world we always have to remember that that person is loved by God and that's not a great comforting feeling sometimes until you remember that God also loves you you with that same intensity and he desires to see that person that you hate be in a right relationship with him and God forbid that we should ever be the stumbling block for one of God's creation to ever be blocked from a relationship with him because of our attitude of unforgiveness that's difficult stuff right there that's graduate level Jesus following before we try to fix a relationship we need to make sure that we have in fact the right attitude so in America we hold a high value around conflict and the high value that we have around conflict is we win and you lose that's our value the the and so we're going to talk about four conflict paradigms real quickly we have this cultural idea of we win you lose that's a high value if you win you walk away you're like woohoo the idea here is that the battle is more important than the relationship with this mentality Your Love becomes conditional based only upon the response of the other person as long as it's the response that allows you to win but in the Kingdom of Jesus your life and your relationships are not a competition it's not about winning and losing an example that sticks out out in my head is of someone at another church that I was at and I was there on a Sunday when the pastor was encouraging people to go and like as as part of their call to follow Jesus to go and make things right with other people and they were supposed to go and apologize to people people that they had offended people that they had harmed and ask for forgiveness and so on that Sunday I saw somebody walk up to another person kind of aggressively you know likeoh man what are they going to say like it was going to be one of those moments they walk up one lady walks up to another lady who's sitting down just kind of reflecting and praying and the lady that's aggressively walking over goes up and Taps her on his shoulder okay I forgive you and walks away it was great because she completely missed the point of the message okay I forgive you one I don't think anybody believed that especially God but she completely missed the point she was more interested in winning because she was the first to say I forgive you than she was in the relationship and a lot of relationships a lot of marriages particularly get stuck at this stage everything is about defeating about winning it's about conquering or triumphing or being right more or or sometimes even more importantly about them being wrong that's tough I mean seriously in 30 years of pastoring the number of people that have come into my office a spouse has come in and said pastor oh my marriage is in so much trouble and the following has never occurred and I am mostly to blame I'm selfish I'm unyielding I'm ungiving I'm selfish I am hot-tempered I'm spiritually inept I'm selfish I'm un nurturing unforgiving I'm selfish I only want it my way that has never happened in my whole life I've never heard anybody say that because it's about winning and losing it's about them winning and the other person losing because that's our Paradigm for conflict so often there is another Paradigm which is the opposite of it which is lose win which is where you just give up and give in the proverbial nice guy who always always finishes last right so that's the lose win then there's a third one which is the lose lose option the lose lose Paradigm I think Lynn is familiar with this for real for real it's like if I can't win nobody wins it's like the rule of the street like if I don't win I'm taking everybody down with me I'm going to burn it all down right that's a that's a that's a thing and it's in some of us but the way of the kingdom is different it's win-win it's not your way or my way it's a better way a higher way it's not enabling rather it's the opposite as the worship team comes up it requires change maybe not quite the way you would have it but nevertheless it requires change forward movement get coming together so Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5:9 in the greatest sermon in history the words that people that follow Jesus and don't follow Jesus all say are the wisest words ever spoken he says blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the sons of God so in a kingdom of God being a peacemaker is the highest of value would you stand with me as we close so again the will of God for your life be reconciled to God and help others be reconciled to God and sometimes helping others be reconciled to God is being reconciled with each other so these kind of messages always cause you to have lots of thoughts and feelings and thinking about different relationships so today I would encourage you surrender those things to God invite the spirit invite the Holy Spirit to speak to you about next steps about how to move forward how to be reconciled to somebody you're Waring with and if you're not right with God [Music] today the critical point from Jesus here is that God wants to be right right with you he wants you to be right with each other so you can be reconciled to God you can ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins to lead your life he's always ready to do that so start there and then start by reconciling other relationships let's spend some time in prayer today the worship team will lead us the altars are open if you'd like to come and pray [Music]", "[Music] amen amen all right let's make sure that we keep our children and teens in prayer as they go back to school this year um it's been a complicated last couple of years and now they're back and so let's keep them very intently in prayer today we have a special treat today pastor jesse is going to come up and share in just a moment but i want to make sure that you understand that this is a great opportunity for you to practice saying amen all right or or encouraging okay so this is a great chance uh for you to uh to really get behind pastor jesse as he comes up and shares it was a great first service that's gonna be even better in this service so welcome pastor jesse right now [Applause] good morning east coast international church how we doing that middle crowd y'all got it but i need the whole room to try one more time good morning east coast international church how we doing ah i like it i need it at two services guys the second it gets a little hard to do but but this energy is gonna keep me going well just to uh uh repeat what pastor curtis said my name is jesse lobotto i'm the youth immediate pastor here at east coast international church and i have the great privilege of doing that i'm also husband to my amazing wife joanna lobato who's not here but i always got to shout her out she's the best but whether you know me or you don't something you guys probably didn't know about me was and my height and my my physical look might have given this away already but back in middle school okay i had this thing called hoop dreams okay don't laugh this is serious this is not meant to be a joke this is for real okay for those who don't know what hoop dreams are in middle school i i believed it was a realistic goal and a dream of mine i created a whole three-step program to accomplish it that i was going to make it into the professional basketball world whether it be the nba or whether it be overseas i believe that i can do it thank you who's that thank you thank you brother and in seventh and eighth grade i'd be in the ymca all the time after school playing pickup games doing these workouts doing these drills doing everything i can to get better when i was home i was watching all these basketball highlights of these point guards that were under six feet because i believe god was going to give me like a major growth spurt but just in case right i needed to know how the little dudes play right so i was looking into it watching these videos they were hyping me up but step one of my journey to achieving my hoop dream was to make the middle school basketball team i missed the tryouts um in seventh grade so eighth grade was like this is going to be the year i do it's my last year middle school i'm gonna make it happen and so i try out i made the team i was starting point guard and guys i had a pretty good season like i was proud of myself yeah we could it was you know i did my thing step one was done step two though was making the freshman team at malden high school and so over the course of the summer going into high school when i was at the y i had all these other middle schoolers that i would play against and we became one unit we were no longer rivals but we were a team and so i was getting close to these other guys i was getting close to my guys at my middle school and over time we became one unit so much so that we created a facebook chat of all the people we believe would embody the freshman team crazy stuff and so i was in the chat you know what i mean i was like okay i got this in the bag it's it's gonna happen and we were chatting it we would encourage one another in it we would talk about who the starting lineup would be who the six man would be all of that stuff it's almost like we already knew who was making the team and things were starting to really look good for me and so we fast forward high school starts freshman year and it's the day of the tryouts and it's day one and if you've tried out for any sports team you know that on the first day they they just do a bunch of these conditioning drills to kind of see where you're at athletically right and one of the things they had us do were these runs called suicides which if you play basketball you know how terrible these things are it's not fun there's nothing enjoying about it like it's a terrible workout and i know it's a bad name for joe but that's just what the drill was not that it has anything to do with the story i just remember getting ready to run these suicides being on the baseline and i looked to my left and there was a dude wearing a collared shirt and a pair of jeans some regular oh she was about to run these suicides had nothing to do with anything but i just thought man if this is who i'm going up against we got it it's gonna happen you know what i mean and so i don't know why he gave me a boost of confidence but it did seeing this dude dress for a regular day of school about a run these crazy runs and so day one happens we do all these conditioning drills i held my own i did pretty good and i was excited because i was like things are still looking good for me hoop dreams i still see it happening but that was only day one i still had to have day two of the tryouts now day two was super important because day two is when they make the first cuts so in order for me to continue this hoop dream that i had i had to make the first cuts and day two rolls around and this is when it came time for the shooting drills and and the dribbling drills and the passing drills and and the scrimmages just to see how you would work in a team situation and and can i tell you guys like i thought i was going to kill it but i folded it was terrible every time i got the ball i was hesitating every time i did a shooting draw i was missing it every time we were doing some passing drills like it was i was just messing everything up it's like everything that i've learned and worked hard for just got thrown out the window and day two of tryouts was over and the coaches tell all of us to go sit down and this is the time of the first cuts and so they start to call out one name after one name and i start hearing my friends names the one you know the one on the facebook chat it's all like okay i'm hearing their name so i must be next at some point but name kept getting called after name kept getting called and i wasn't hearing mine and then i heard for the rest of you guys thanks for trying out you know that speech and my heart just sank and i wish i could tell you guys what the coaches said after that but truth be told i got all my stuff i ran out you know the push bars on the gym doors i pushed that thing out door hit the wall i ran out as fast as i could because i just started to solve and i didn't want to see i didn't want my friends to see me crying in this very moment but i was heartbroken because i thought i had this trials in the back i thought it was going to be me on this team whether it be a point guard whether it be a six-man no matter what it was i thought i was making this team and at one moment it was all destroyed because i couldn't even make the first cuts i thought i was getting a step closer to my hoop dreams and at that moment it just went miss jen do you know what it's like so try out to give everything you have hearing your friend's name gets called up and that friend's name get called up except yours and you get cut alongside with the dude who wore a collar shirt and jeans to run suicides it's terrible it's embarrassing it was the worst feeling ever i can laugh now because i i healed for me you guys probably think you must you might be still healing from it brother but but guys i walked home and cried the whole entire way the whole entire way and if you're here and i'm wondering is it possible to cry for over 45 minutes it is that's how long the walk was and i cried from the minute i left the school to the second i got home and i thought i cried all the tears that i could until i walked inside and my sister was in the living room and she was like you okay and it just went boom we're right back right out again i started crying the rest of the night it i was just heartbroken and i just want to point out in the room if you also fell victim to getting cut from a sports team i will be starting a group this fall a support group actually and so if you're hurting if you're hurting come on come on join my group go heal together and get through this thing but here i have this moment in life right where i gave all i had to something that i thought would bring back reward all i had to something that i thought would bring back purpose and hope and excitement but in the end i just came back empty heartbroken disappointed and discouraged i gave everything i could to see a result i was desperately hoping for i gave my time i gave my energy i gave my sacrifice i gave all my effort i wasted all my data on watching these youtube videos of of nate robinson playing ball just to try to get like him i i gave it all but in the end i came back empty-handed at the time basketball was my whole entire identity guys and without that i truly felt hopeless as if there was just nothing more to do after that and i know this sounds super over exaggerated but it was a real heartbreak in my life of a boy who had some hoop dreams but maybe there are some of us in this room who can relate or in a similar place right now you've given your all to see something happen in your life you've given your all to see a change of results you gave all your efforts to find peace or clarity or purpose or provision or or even a fresh passion in your relationship with jesus and after giving your all after putting in your best efforts you find yourself coming up short and coming up empty in one part of the bible specifically in mark 5 jesus had just healed a man who was demon possessed and now jesus was headed back to the other side of the lake he came from and as he arrives he's met by this humongous crowd and out of this humongous crowd a man comes forward and asks jesus to heal his daughter because his daughter was dying and so jesus went with him but that's not the story we're going to talk about today the story we're going to talk about today is a woman we're introduced to as jesus was on his journey to doing just that mark 5 24 introduces this woman like this jesus went with him and all the people followed crowding around him a woman in the crowd had suffered for 12 years with constant bleeding she had suffered a great deal for many doctors and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them but she had gotten no better in fact she had gotten worse she had heard about jesus so she came up behind him through the crowd everybody say through the crowd and touched his robe for she thought to herself if i can just touch his robe i will be healed immediately the bleeding stopped and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition we discover as we're introduced to this woman that she's been dealing with this issue of constant bleeding for 12 long years and she gave everything she possibly could to find a cure for the sickness she had she gave all of her money she gave all of her time she gave all of her resources to many doctors hoping to find a cure and the bible says that her too after giving her all hoping to see the results that she so desperately longed for instead came back empty-handed not any better and as a matter of fact she came back worse this did not only have an effect on her physical body but this played out in her whole entire life too not because of the condition she had but because at this time the religious ruling stated that somebody with her condition would be considered unclean until this illness went away and what it means to be considered unclean is that if you're unclean anything you touch becomes unclean if you're unclean anybody you touch becomes unclean until this illness goes and so because of this chances are that nobody wanted to be around her nobody wanted to have their things around her and people were just trying to stay away from this woman and because she came back empty after giving her all longing to see the result of getting better this is what her life consisted of every day hurting outcasted isolated hopeless every day for 12 years and it would have continued except church this day was very different and we find that it was different because in this very day jesus was in her midst she probably um and what we heard about this what we learned about this woman is that she heard a couple things about jesus she probably heard about the demons that he had casted out she probably heard that he's healed the sick that he's made paralyzed people walk again and probably all of the other miracles that he had done up to this point and because of what she heard a faith began to stir inside this woman that no matter what the doctors were telling her no matter what life was looking like for her that if if there was any hope left for this woman if there was any chance of healing left for this woman that it can only be found in jesus and because she believed these things she chose to let her life no longer be driven by what the doctor said she chose to no longer let her life be driven by of the condition that she had she chose to no longer let her life be driven by what the people were saying around her but she chose to allow her life to be driven by the faith in what she heard about jesus and because she believed in these things she knew that all it took all it can take is an encounter with jesus and healing can come into her life she knew that that if she could just have an encounter with jesus that her whole life can be changed all around she believed that even if she was able to just touch a bit of his robe that it would be enough to produce change in her life she didn't believe these things because of some superstition or because of some educated guess that she was making but because she was driven by faith built in what she heard about jesus and romans 10 17 tells us that faith for us comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god and the word of god tells us a couple things about jesus guys the word of god tells us that jesus is our salvation now by his stripes we are healed that in our times of hopelessness he is our living hope that he is the one who comforts us in all of our troubles that he will supply all of our needs according to his riches that with christ all things are possible and i don't know what you came in with this morning i don't know what results you've been longing for i don't know the efforts that you've been giving in just to come back empty-handed but what i do know is that if we allow our lives to be driven by faith built on the word of god what was true for this woman is true for us today that if we can just have an encounter with jesus something in our life can begin to change that if we can just have an encounter with jesus things can break off of us that if we can just have an encounter with jesus hope can come healing can take place not because of some superstition or blind belief but because that's who jesus is [Applause] but before she got to the place of touching the robe of jesus before she got to the place of the encounter we see that there was an obstacle in her way here we see this woman fully driven by faith no longer looking back ready to go towards jesus and all the way in the distance down there jesus is walking but in between both of them was this crowd and what we learn here is that in order to get to jesus the woman had to get through the crowd this was a massive crowd that followed around jesus this wasn't no little crowd another translation says that the crowd pressed around jesus a ton of people that were packed in like a bunch of sardines and if you've ever tried taking a blue line back from boston during rush hour you know what this crowd looks like you know this was a big crowd this very crowd though was also living within the rules of the time the rule that we know called this woman unclean this was the crowd that would identify her by her brokenness this is the crowd that probably stayed away from her and fear that they might be unclean and the crowd that she was supposed to be nowhere near because of her condition and in order to get to jesus she had to go through that crowd not only must have must have been physically uncomfortable to get through such a massive tight crowd like that but it must have been a scary moment for her to go against everything that was said about her to go against all the orders that were given to her it could not have been easy and honestly i think it's a very fair assessment to say that that if we had left it up to the crowd this woman was getting nowhere near jesus just imagine if in this very moment she allowed her life to be dictated by the crowd what if she felt like there were too many people to get through what if she was so focused on how they would respond what if she allowed the intimidation of the crowd to hold her back from heading towards jesus and the answer is that she if she allowed her life to be dictated by the crowd in front of her she would have probably gone back to the same place she found herself in hopeless still empty-handed defined by her brokenness still longing for the results she not only desperately wanted but so desperately needed if she allowed her life to be dictated by the crowd in front of her she would have just had this moment of being in proximity to jesus but never truly encountering him by touching his robe and at every stage of our faith in our lifelong pursuit of following jesus we will always have moments of being met by the crowd it may not be the crowd we see here in mark but it could be the crowd of fear discouragement anxiety temptation doubt busyness laziness bad relationships and even apathy and if we allow our lives to be dictated by those crowds and pressures we'll end up resorting to what the crowd is saying as opposed to what god is wanting to do in the moment going back to the blue line conversation i knew that because prior to here i worked at starbucks all the way in boston and the blue line was my daily commute and when i'd get in the train in the morning it was empty like i'd be the only one there i could sleep i could do whatever but by the time i was at state street and i needed to get out there was like hundreds of people in the car and i saw the exit but there were a ton of people to get through and if it's your time to get out and you leave it up to those people to let you out you're never getting out you missing your stop call your manager you're late to work like it's happening you may be able to see that door open but you're gonna watch it close as long as you leave it up to them you have to make a decision in that moment to push through the massive crowd in order to get out of the train into your destination here's where i'm going with this as long as we allow our lives to be dictated by the crowd we will always find ourselves in danger of being in proximity to jesus without ever truly having an encounter with him and there comes a moment when facing the crowd where we have to decide whether we will allow jesus to dictate our steps or the crowd but they our feet cannot be dictated by both and maybe there are some of us here in this room in in revere watching online that have gotten stuck behind the crowds of our lives some of us that have gotten far too comfortable with being in proximity with jesus but not having encounters with him and for those of us in that situation i believe that today god is calling us out of that to no longer allow our lives to be dictated by the crowds but to press through them and reach out to jesus to encounter him and just like this woman pressing through the crowd doing this is gonna be uncomfortable you might have to do some things you're not used to doing pushing through the crowds for sure is not easy but it's required in order to get to jesus and so this woman we find here choosing to live a life driven by faith choosing to no longer let her life be dictated by the crowd she squeezes into these the pack of sardines of a crowd and the bible says that she gets right behind jesus just close enough to reach out as far as she can and touch the bit of his robe and the bible says that immediately the bleeding stopped and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition worship team you can come on up but the story doesn't end here i like i like a good hug story does not end here mark 5 30 continues the story like this jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him so he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my robe his disciples said to him look at this crowd pressing around you how can you ask who touched me but he kept on looking around to see who had done it then the frightened woman trembling at the realization of what had happened to her came and fell to her and he's in front of him and told him what she had done and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace you're suffering is over and what i love about the end of this story is that jesus could have easily just kept on walking he had somewhere to be he could have easily just gone to where he needed to go but he stopped he turned around at this massive crowd and asked the ridiculous question who touched my robe the question was so ridiculous that his disciples looked at him and was like bro jesus everybody's touching your role what do you mean there's tons of people here but jesus waited anyways and wouldn't you know it that the woman who had just been healed fell to her knees in front of him and testified what she had done and you know i i when i was reading this part i just began to wonder like i wonder what the crowd all started to say all of us said i wonder if the crowd started to recognize this woman it was like wait you're not clean you should not be in this whole group right here you should be way out there i i began to wonder what the crowd might have said but the reason why it's not stated here is because it doesn't matter what the crowd says well matter is what jesus called her [Applause] jesus goes to her and says daughter your faith has made you well go in peace your suffering is over this is the only time in the new testament that jesus called anyone daughter the the crowd the woman who the crowd defined by her brokenness by her illness jesus was defining by her identity in him the story that introduced this woman who had this condition jesus concluded this story by calling her daughter this is so important to understand because if all jesus wanted to do was a miracle in her life he would have just gone out from that point the job was done but by stopping honoring her faith and calling her daughter he was not looking to just heal her but to give her a brand new life and identity in him [Music] ephesians 1 5 says that god decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through jesus christ this is what he wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure god wants to do so much more than just perform a miracle in our lives church he is calling us into a relationship with him as sons and as daughters and through christ we have been adopted into his family you know i wish i knew if in this moment i wish we knew like the next five years of this woman's life if she continued to walk in this new identity or she just continued to walk as a daughter in christ though we may never know what we do know here is that ultimately though jesus gave that identity to her she had to make the decision to walk in it just as it was up to her though god calls us into this new life and identity we have to make the decision to continually walk into amen let's stand [Music] church the good news today thankfully is we don't have to wait for a moment we don't have to wait for a special occasion we don't have to wait for jesus to just waltz down the road street or cooler street jesus has made himself available to us all right now as a matter of fact every time we meet together here on a sunday it's an opportunity to have an encounter with jesus every time you're in your car blasting that worship music it's an opportunity to have an encounter with jesus every time you're alone in your room praying and worshiping god that is an opportunity to have an encounter with jesus and through every hardship through every tough situation you face that too is an opportunity to have an encounter with jesus so as we wrap up this morning there are there are two people i want to talk to in this room the first person is is if you're that person who's been giving your all and coming back empty i want you to know that that thing you've been longing for whatever it might be it's ultimately found in jesus christ and please do not wait till you've given absolutely everything you can do not wait till you've searched every single place you can do not wait till you're out on your absolute last legs if you've never reached out to jesus and accepted him into your life to lead you this space right here that we call the altar is open for you to make that decision today [Music] second person i want to talk to is is the one that's here and it's saying pastor jesse i've i've allowed my life to be dictated by the crowd i've gotten comfortable with being in proximity with jesus and not having encounters with him if that's you i would first like to ask that you identify those crowds in your life the crowds in front of you that have been holding you back from your encounter with jesus and second i like to ask that you too come to this altar as a symbol of no longer allowing your life to be dictated by the crowds but by the guidance in the leading of jesus today church let's allow our lives to be built on a faith that's in the word of god let's no longer allow our lives to be dictated by the crowd and know that when that miracle happens in your life when that miracle comes into your life god isn't just finished there he is looking to give you a new identity and a new life in him so this altar is open and if you feel led to come up now's the time as we sing this last song", "we are going to continue our series that we started last week this is just a two-part quick series on rebuilding and repairing and uh I don't know if you are aware uh that we have a men's Recovery Group that just started this past Tuesday um so men men's recovery meeting at El Centro 85 which is right next door 85 men Street uh every Tuesday night at 7 o'cl so uh if if you would like to join that 12ep group all you have to do is show up and be a man so there we go there we go so I don't know if you've ever been chased have you ever been chased like chased like maybe you have dreams of being chased right like like like sorry about that there's some psychological stuff going on there but I I know what that is but so but some people have been chased like by a dog like you know you're running away from the dog or uh in our neighborhood we have special uh uh special security that chases strangers and unsuspecting visitors and it's kind of funny uh we have uh turkeys that roam our neighborhood and uh people that are unfamiliar with the the relationship with the turkey you kind of have to have like a relationship they come in and they they can the turkeys can sense the fear and they come after they come after and they chase you down my wife was driving down one of the hills and a lady a complete and total stranger uh that we uh did not know uh was being chased by a turkey down the street and jumped into my wife's car just literally open the door and jumped in to get a shelter from from the turkey that was in Hot Pursuit of her right so it was just just wild so I want you think about this idea of being chased and you know a lot of us like I said in the dreams we want being chased it's not like a good thing but if what if we were being chased by a good thing somebody was something good was chasing us to to do something good for us so in the 23rd psalm it says this the Lord is my shepherd I have all that I need he lets me rest in green meal he leads me beside peaceful streams he renews my strength he guides me along right paths bringing honor to his name even when I walk through the darkest Valley I will not be afraid for you are close Beside Me Your Rod and your staff protect and comfort me you prepare A Feast for me in the presence of my enemies you honor Me by anointing my head with oil my cup overflows with blessings surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me like a turkey in Pine Hill will certainly your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I love verse six goodness and mercy or goodness and unfailing love pursue me all the days of my life this I this idea of good things chasing you so that God can get you and bless you is not the first thing we think about if if if you think of God chasing you to get you you know you did something wrong right that's what that's what's going on in your head but in reality goodness and unfailing love goodness and mercy God is chasing to bless you and I love that verse it's it's a fun moment and real reflection there for us so today I want us to find ourselves positioning ourselves so that we are being chased by the goodness of God and specifically that favor the favor of God pursues you and today we are talking about unlocking the favor of God so let me set the scene that started last week the people of Israel had been taken into captivity for quite some time and 40,000 40,000 of them are given permission to return back to Jerusalem to rebuild and repair and uh this the temple the city and resettle the city and so this this group of people led by zerubabel began to rebuild the Temple and get things in order to do what God wants them to do so they're doing the right thing okay so they're doing the right thing they're there they're doing the work uh it's it's all good and they immediately begin to face opposition they they're facing opposition in rebuilding the house of God in Jerusalem and so here's the rest of the story The opposers the people that are opposing the rebuilding that are trying to intimidate them take it the next step the opposers write a formal letter to King Darius to oppose them more to try to intimidate them and to to tattle tail on them so to speak so this happens in our life we are doing the right thing we're trying to do the right thing we're making progress someone opposes us uh maybe somebody's to just mind their own business right but but but just nonetheless it's in the way so what do you do when we're trying to unlock the favor of God what do you do when you are doing the right thing and people try to get in your way what do you do when people that could actually prosper from your efforts choose to be your opposition how do you prosper amongst pessimists and when you're being questioned by posers how do you unlock the favor when you are being dismissed unjustly how do you deal with that so let let's read the next part of the account where we picking up from where we left off last week as they were rebuilding the temple so here's the letter this is the actual letter that was written to the king it's the tattletail letter it's the signed by probably hundreds of people signed it you know like not the not in my backyard folks right whatever it is and so the king uh they're writing to the king about their interaction was zable the leader of the building project so verse 11 of Ezra 5 says this is the answer they gave us we are the Servants of the god of Heaven and Earth and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago one that a great king of Israel built and finished but because our fathers angered the god of Heaven he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the Chalan king of Babylon who destroyed this Temple and deported the people to Babylon however in the first year of Cyrus of Cyrus king of Babylon King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild the house of God he even removed from the Temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon verse 16 so this chesh Bazaar also named zerubabel came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem from that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished so he's literally a guy named T tatoni is literally writing this letter trying to uh tell the king exactly what's going on thinking that the king is going to be really mad thinking that the king is going to be really mad and it's going to stop this atrocity from from occurring it's and so tat andai is really trying to stick it to these guys and he's probably hoping to get some favor from the King some extra special uh treatment and so he's giving every little detail of the exchange but let's take a look in in a moment we'll take a look at what the king says in response but first look inside of what was written in the letter look at how zerubabel and the crew responded when they were opposed when questioned by their opposers they responded gently but with authority and respect gently Authority and respect verse 11 says we are the Servants of the god of Heaven and Earth not very aggressive pretty gentle and we we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago also not aggressive just factual it's honoring of the people that were there and resp and and uh and it was gentle they gave a thorough response a careful response which honored all involved they didn't like come after them aggressively for being disrespectful to them for for uh opposing uh their work they didn't start a massive social media campaign to slander them and and try to get them cancelled they they they gave a clear and thorough response in a respectful and honoring way well that's not going to turn into any movie right that's not going to become a movie um but this is a great reminder to be careful with people the people that oppose you be careful with them because they're not the enemy so don't treat them like they're the enemy don't Hatchet the people people that represent your opposition instead Hatchet the true enemy that the spiritual forces of evil are have captured our mission is to destroy the works of Satan and join Jesus in that mission not to destroy the people that oppose us so through prayer and god-honoring choices that we need to make purifying our lives like living righteously living rightly in all of our life getting right with God like EXP exposing the secret sins in our life giving them to God surrendering them letting him do a restoring and healing work like that's a lot of work to do we're talking about right there so secret sins but there's another kind of sin called a sacred sin like what's a sacred sin a sacred sin is a thing that you've made sacred you've made that sin sacred to the point where like you're like I get all this other stuff okay with me and God but this one this is mine God doesn't have access to that one right so you got to get rid of that sacred sin too if you're going to unlock lock Divine favor in your life some things have just literally got to go they've got to go if you don't want God's favor keep doing that old stuff but if you want to unlock God's Divine favor some things have got to go so respond rightly to your opposition and respond rightly with your life postured against our true enemy which is not our opposition that we face in with other humans verse uh chapter 6 verse 6 we're jumping back in now to the letter that King Darius responds he writes back to tanai and this is what he says this is the best all right th this is a a passage of scripture that I love so much because it it there's so many layers to it but in verse six it says now then tats andai governor of trans Euphrates so that's the place where tats and I is supposed to be overseeing trans Euphrates remember that place and shethar bosan and you their fellow officials of the province stay away from there okay so so he tells them mind your own business it's none of your business but since you made it your business watch this verse 7 do not interfere with the work on this temple of God let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish Elders rebuild the house of God on its sight moreover I hereby decree what you hard to do for these Elders of the Jews in the construction of the house of God gets really good and juicy right now the expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury from the revenues of trans Euphrates not only did they not get what they wanted now they got to pay the guys to do the work out of their own budget out of the trans Euphrates budget so that the work will not stop it continues whatever is needed young Bulls Rams mail Lambs for burnt offerings to the god of heaven and wheat salt wine and oil as requested by the priest in Jerusalem must be given them daily without fail so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons not only did they get paid for doing something they would have done for free they also get a bonus all the stuff that they need all the stuff that they need to make this happen May God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem it is a fascinating response from the King now inside there in verse 11 it said or in verse 10 said that so that God may offer offer sacrifi so they may offer sacrifices pleasing to God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons so the king understood that these were people that were actually praying for him even if they didn't believe the same stuff even if he wasn't sure about it all he recognized that there was something about it that mattered and he showed favor to them the king finds favor with the temple being rebuilt and instructs the leaders to to help and even though sometimes we wish that the motives of everybody that was sent along to assist us would be as pure as the motives that you would want sometimes the favor comes from unexpected places and when we treat others with gentleness and respect it allows God to create a flow of resources and favor but it required the correct response at the beginning the the abundance and faith favor of God doesn't happen without the correct without the right response early on so when we treat people our opposition like they are the enemy it clogs up God's provision and favor in rebuilding the house of God and we don't want to clog up that opportunity we don't want to clog up God's provision instead we should treat people as though they are actually in the enemy's camp and that they need to be freed from the enemy even if they don't know that they are captives remember our battle is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers so here we have the favor of God coming in there's three rules for resources three rules for resources the first rule is this be shrewd be shrewd Matthew chapter 10 verse6 says look I am sending you out as a sheep Among Wolves so so be shrewd as snakes and harmless as doves so in the parable of the shrewd worker in the parable of the shrewd worker Jesus highlights this meaning of this this idea of shrewd so watch this in Luke 16 verse 9 it says this here's the less Jesus says this here's the lesson use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends then when your possessions are are gone they will welcome you to an eternal home so the shrewd person the shrewd person of handling God's favor go handling God's resources the definition of what that means is to benefit others and make friends with the resources so you're being shrewed in how you use the resources the talents the treasure the things that God gives you so that the first one is be shrew so we're again there's rules for the resources there's rules for the favor of God second one is be careful very important be tell your neighbor be careful be careful for real this is very important be please be careful okay we are warned in scripture to be careful 1 Timothy chapter 6 For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil okay it's the love of money not money so the love of money is the root so when you love the money when you love the stuff when you love the things when you love the Trinkets and the gadgets when you when you love it right there's a really interesting moment in the Bible when Moses is up talking with God so Moses the leader of the people he's up talking to God on the Mountain uh they're they're having some important conversations God's establishing the rules for the for the nation of Israel it's a really critical moment and so Moses leaves his associate Aaron in charge of the Israelites while he's up talking to God in chapter 32:32 it says when the people saw how long it was taking Moses to come down from the mountain they gathered around Aaron come on they said make us some Gods who can lead us we don't even know what happened to this fellow Moses who brought us here from the land of Egypt so get to these are the wrong Gods this is not the God who delivered them from Egypt these are the false gods that they used to see their uh their masters Worship in Egypt so Aaron said take the gold rings from the ears your wives and sons and daughters and bring them to me all the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron that Aaron took the gold melted it down molded it into the shape of a calf when the people saw it they exclaimed oh Israel these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt this is a problem this is a huge problem lots of different levels layers here of problems first off they just attributed their freedom to false gods demonic Gods instead of to the God who actually kept got them out of Egypt uh they uh began to worship a false god who is like one of the same gods that they were worshiping in Egypt that their masters worshiped so they took the gold their jewelry and turned it into a false god all their jewelry look at your jewelry for a second that you have on right now do you have any jewelry you know like some of you are wearing some things that you thought was real gold and diamonds maybe it is maybe it isn't we'll see right so but anyhow they look at all your je so here they have they're collecting all the jewelry to make this false god but it's not just the problem of worshiping a false god that's happening here there's another layer here where did the jewelry come from where did the jewelry come from they had just been slaves for 400 years what there weren't a lot of gold acquiring opportunities when you're enslaved they weren't walking around like in fashion shows with with all their gold and fancy jewelry they certainly didn't have it when they were enslaved how in the world do they have it out in the desert here's how in Exodus 12:35 just before they're getting ready to leave Egypt they're they're being released the people of Egypt want them out so bad now verse 35 and the people of Israel did as Moses instructed they asked the Egyptians for clothing and articles of silver and gold the Lord caused the Egyptians to look favorably on the Israelites and they gave the Israelites whatever they asked for so they stripped the Egyptians of their wealth Hallelujah they got their jewelry from Egypt they got their jewelry because God provided for them you see they were getting they were leaving Egypt they were broke they needed some some uh some abundance in order to establish themselves as a nation it literally was a gift from God to the people of Israel and how did they use it they used it to commit adultery they used it to worship a false god they used it for evil instead of for good how many times has God given us a good thing and we use it the wrong way or for the wrong purposes that's the lesson right there there was consequence to these people for missing God's or for messing up God's favor and abundance for misusing it verse 28 of Exodus 32 the first the first consequence was that uh there were 3,000 people that were essentially executed as a result of this misconduct it says the Levites obeyed moses' command and about 3,000 people died that day it appears that amongst the people there were these instigators some people that were like driving this idea it came from somewhere those that had encouraged the idolatry they were trying to deceive the people into false thinking and to to a false way of living much like the serpent in the Garden of Eden like trying to deceive trying to so they had everything they ever could have wanted they had all the abundance all the favor and they misused it verse 33 it continues but the Lord replied to Moses no I will erase the name somebody say erase okay I will erase the the name of everyone who has sinned against me this is the most terrifying verse in the whole Bible literally Exodus 32:33 if you want to if you want to have a bad dream read that verse right before you go to bed I will erase the name of everyone who has sinned against me what what God is doing here he's referring to his book of life he's referring to this this this idea that he writes down the names of everybody that's in his kingdom and here he says to his people because of this act your names are being erased or blotted out of my book you're no longer part of my kingdom it's a it's a terrifying verse verse 35 then the Lord continuing the consequences then the Lord sent a Great Plague upon the people because they had worshiped the calf Aaron had made now all those there was some people that had clearly instigated the situation everybody that participated was held responsible and it ser and so the plague came so it serves as a warning with God's favor be careful with the resources that God entrusts to you the favor of God should never be taken lightly the favor of God can never be used for idolatry or idolatrous thoughts or idolatrous things we don't worship a lot of golden cows in America in 2024 anymore but we have turned other things in our life into golden cows things and ideas and opportunities a house can become an idol if you're not careful Fame can become an idol luxury and opulence can become an idol pleasure can become an idol so we have to be careful we have to be careful with abundance we have to be careful with the provision and favor of God so be shrewd be careful third be fruitful be fruitful Jesus once told a story that we find in Matthew Chapter 5 25 about three servants and each of these three servants according to their gifts or abilities was given a a certain um amount of resources okay a certain amount of finances and two of the servants used and invested and increased the resources that they had for the master and they doubled it but there was one uh servant that even though he had abilities he hid the resources instead of using them correctly in verse 21 of this story Jesus says the master was full of Praise well done my good and faith faithful servant he's talking about the ones that used it well you have been faithful in handling the small amount so now I will give you many more responsibilities let's celebrate together so that this is a good this is a positive thing near the end of the parable the UN the unfruitful servant it says this it says what will happen but from those who do nothing even what little they have will be taken away you see the favor of God requires faithfulness and fruitfulness and God makes it clear we're not supposed to fool around or be unwise with his favor or with his abundance don't fool around with the gifts that God gives you use them the way God intends use them well and use them wisely and to those the scripture says to those who use well what they are given even more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who do nothing even what little they have will be taken away worship team can come on up this idea of rebuilding and repairing the house of God like in Jerusalem in the text but in Lynn rebuilding and repairing the house of God in Lynn is rebuilding and repairing human beings people because people are the new house of God for those that follow him that's what that's what we're doing that's the work that we are doing so let's unlock the favor of God and see his house rebuilt in the city of Lynn so be shrewd be careful these are things that we need to do be fruitful so that we continue to have the abundance that we need Let Jesus use you he's given you gifts he's given you talents he's given you stuff use what you have don't worry about what you don't have use what you have that's what God's interested in in your to your ability use what you have use what God has given you it may the favor of God chase you down and bless you like a turkey in Pine Hill so that you can be a blessing to those around you stand with me as we close Hallelujah I'm going to have to hang out with those turkeys this afternoon uh [Music] friends I something that I hope that you know is that God is not against you he he's he's fighting for you he's fighting on your behalf he's drawing you to himself over and over again he invites us to partner with him in doing his work in this world and this is one of the thanks this is one of the ways that he does that just by chasing us down with favor and blessing the worship team will close here with this song if you'd like to spend some time in prayer today inviting God into your situations you can do so", "\n\n**next level**\n\nrehearse the transition from 200 - 500 -\n\n  \n\nempowerment of

booked accordingly now many years ago I went to get my commercial driver's license permit my CDL and the reason I went to get a CDL I was not looking for a new career I just wanted to make sure that if somebody needed to move the church bus that could be done and so I I went to get my CDL I studied the manual on the way to get my CDL permit I studied it in line at the RMV for about 30 seconds so maybe three minutes you know it was not very long though I went in to the computer room to take my test my permit test on the computer and I failed it I failed it I immediately took the test again like that they would let you do that then I literally just pressed the buttons paid the new price started taking the test again uh because I wanted to remember the answers to the questions I had just failed all right so I I got I passed it that time the lesson of the story is you might not want to be in a bus with me if I'm driving it Oh it's so bad so I I so certainly I failed the first test the permit test but the truth is it didn't bother me because I knew that I hadn't studied I just kind of shrugged it off I wasn't properly prepared now a few years go by quite a few years go by and my oldest daughter Kyla is going to get her driver's permit so we go into the RMV she had actually studied more than me for her permit test and she got her permit and everything was good however while we were waiting it to get the opportunity for her to take the permit test it was a little bit stressful at the RMV can you imagine that the RMV would be stressful right but it was a little bit stressful there that day the place was packed one person after another is coming out of that permit room having failed the permit test I mean some were really angry and they were like adamant that they were going to let the whole RMV know how angry they were then other young people would come out after they had failed their permit test and burst into tears because it was it was deeply uh troubling for them and then one lady came out having not passed her permit test and went into a full-scale panic attack because she realized that the job that she had just gotten she would no longer be able to keep it was tough I thought the iron V needs to hire some counselors right now like the Army needs to ask the counselors out here because this is an emotionally complicated place here at the RMV well have you noticed in life that we've all failed we all fail we have moments in our life when we fail when we disappoint others disappoint ourselves disappoint God we simply have failed some failures have a way of bouncing right off you they happen it hits you it doesn't stick and you just move on with your life other failures how have a way of hitting you deep and they stick to you like they got tattooed to you in fact some of the failures you literally have tattooed on your body right now like some of you're like oh yeah I wish I could get rid of that they're like but they are Inked on and you went to find out how much it costs to take it off and it was too much money for some of us failure is an experience though that has turned into a prison of sorts a failure prison in your life and every time that you try to make forward progress the failures of your past seem to come back to torment you like little demon snakes that emerge from whatever path you're on to try to prevent any current progress and just to taunt you and mock you and these these tormentors can keep you from moving forward and hold you into a captivity of sorts so today I want to help us in this walk on out series I want to help you to walk on out from failure I want to I want to help you to learn how to walk on out from the treacherous Tar Pits of failure you see let's start with the Bible throughout the Bible we see not a story of Perfect People we see a story of a perfect God who works with imperfect people you might think that the Bible was filled with one story after another of really like holy righteous people but that's generally not the case rather we see a history of God working with deeply flawed men and women who regularly fail like that's the common theme of the Bible that people fail all the time even the people that we hold up as our heroes they fail and sometimes they fail in the most disappointing of ways it's just fundamentally problematic Adam the very beginning let's go back to the beginning in the Bible Genesis Adam fails and that might be the understatement of the century right he didn't just fail he he failed for everybody he Unleashed a pandemic of sin that literally messed up everything in the universe and then made a leaf loincloth and tried to hide because that's what he did but you know what God does God still pursues Adam he goes after him that Moses great man of God and Faith he murders somebody and runs away for 40 years but God still chases after Moses in Elijah one of the most has the most outrageous display of public faith and ushers in this amazing miracle and then almost immediately after this great miracle where he calls down fire from heaven he almost immediately loses faith and runs and hides like right after and God still pursues Elijah and then there's King David King David abuses his privilege and Power committing the most horrific series of ethical and moral Abominations but God still pursues David but not this moment you might be thinking what kind of God pursues these people all right okay it's it's an interesting idea and then there's Simon Peter Simon Peter Simon Peter is The Rock he is this indestructible force that hangs out with Jesus he is this man that is going to make sure that Jesus is taken care of Peter man of faith and conviction and courage and one night he is sitting with Jesus at dinner it turns out that this will be the last time that the disciples the followers of Jesus eat dinner together with Jesus before Jesus dies and Jesus looks at Peter his rock star and says Simon Satan has asked to sift you as wheat that's just fancy language for to say that Satan is coming for you but I have prayed for you Simon that your faith may not fail and when you have turned back strengthen your brothers so Jesus is telling Peter hey you're going to mess up but make sure you turn back he replied Lord I am ready to go with you to prison and death Jesus answered I tell you Peter before the rooster crows today you will deny three times that you know me verse 47 while Jesus was still speaking a crowd came up and the man who called was called Judas one of the twelve was leading them he approached Jesus to kiss him but Jesus asked him Judas are you betraying the son of man with a kiss 54 then seizing him they LED Jesus away took him into the house of the high priest Peter followed at a distance but when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together Peter sat down with them a servant girl girl saw him seated there in the Fire Light look closely at him and said this man was with him but Peter denied it woman I don't know him he said a little later someone else saw him and said you are also one of them man I am not Peter replied now remember Jesus Jesus can see all of this happening for where Jesus is being held about an hour later another asserted certainly this fellow was with him for he is a Galilean Peter replied man I don't know what you are talking about just as he was speaking the rooster crowd the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter I wonder what that look was like then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him before the rooster crows today you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly oh man Peter so much potential what a gut punch Peter the rock the man of Faith the power and courage in the moment when it counts the most Peter fails to this very day when Christian artists are creating art about the early church and their depicting Peter they still depict Peter with a rooster that's how much this stuck failure is real and it hurts and failures have a way of locking you up they have a way of locking you up so you can't move forward when for example the job that you love is lost and it turns out it's actually for something you did it kind of sticks in your throat or maybe the marriage ends in divorce and you feel like a failure suddenly you might even feel like an outcast other times people find themselves single and as a result feel like they are a failure for that and insensitive people around them inadvertently rub it in or maybe a couple that wants to have kids and for some reason they're unable to and they feel like they've failed and people are generally clueless and sometimes say extremely hurtful things it feels like a failure or maybe the kids aren't turning out good or are going through difficult times and sometimes parents feel like failures and you get overwhelmed with guilt failure sometimes it's just a moment sometimes it's an event but oftentimes it's more of an event it's also what takes place after the failure after moment there's some be some really negative long-term effects from failure sometimes people get into a bad habit of looking to God and blaming God for something that took place or maybe they lose a sense of self-worth and they stop valuing who they are maybe they become cynical with life and people and themselves maybe their souls start to fracture it becomes not a good thing these are heavy things that failure can bring but today listen carefully God does not want us to walk in this way God does not want us to walk among the Tar Pits of failure instead he wants to extend to us his hand of grace and mercy in the Book of Luke chapter 9 it says for the son of man Jesus has not come to destroy people's lives but to save them this has always been God's plan to save his people to save people to rescue people not to leave us in tar pits or quicksand or places of Destruction Psalm 103 says he puts the victims back on their feet God wants us to be on his Rock and not to be sinking there's this thing that happens in life sometimes when you fail you fail without God and then you find yourself in real trouble but when you learn to fail and call out to God in those moments when you learn to invite God into the Brokenness of that moment when we learn to exchange our our garments with God for example when when we bring our tattered and dirty and stained and unwashed garments to God God wants to trade with us he will take the bad stuff and give us some good stuff for the nasty garment he will give you a fresh garment for the dirty stain garment he will give you a clean and pristine garment for the smelly garment he will give you a garment with the sweetest aroma he trades with us he trades Garment of failure with a garment of righteousness a garment of failure with a garment of Hope a garment of failure with a garment of forgiveness it turns out that God is in the Garment exchange business he loves trading the nasty garments for the good garments and he never wants us to stay in those Tar Pits of failure so how do you get out how do you get out how do you take the path out how do you walk on out from those places of failure first is this first step release it somebody say release so you release it to God don't release it to the universe that's not going to help you release it to God sometimes we need to release the dreams that are not happening that we wish would happen sometimes you know how to release those sometimes we need to release the guilt or feelings of disappointment and sometimes we must release things to God by repenting Proverbs 28 says he who conceals his sins does not Prosper but whoever confesses and renounces them finds Mercy you can't find that Mercy unless you bring it to God unless you release it to him Hebrews 4 says we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet was without sin let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find Grace to help us in our time of need sometimes we need to release to God whatever's going on by coming out of our hiding somebody say hiding so this is something that people tend to be quite good at or they think they're good at they tend to hide from God this is also called isolating the modern word for this is isolating we isolate ourselves from God from other people I have an old friend that had once known and experienced and walked in the grace and forgiveness and freedom of Jesus and then he found himself having taken back the Reigns of his life and had failed in some of the most publicly humiliating ways many of these failures were the direct result of many hidden hurts in his life that had not ever been addressed he was embarrassed by his failure and he found himself trying to hide from God and from God's people which by the way is exactly what sin will do sin and failure will try to convince you that you can make a leaf loin cloth and hide from God listen it didn't work from God it's def it didn't work for Adam it's definitely not going to work for you okay to make to make a little leaf blowing cloth and try to hide from God God will find you so my friend wrestled and struggled and floundered and made things worse and worse until this great moment that he finally came clean and stopped trying to hide from God and stop trying to hide from God's people and it wasn't until that exact moment in that moment that he was able to fully experience the grace and the mercy of God but it took him releasing release from hiding stop hiding and it drives home this passage in Romans 8. we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purposes what does that mean it means that God is always fighting for you listen you might always be fighting God but God is always fighting for you he's always fighting on your behalf not against you but for you so stop hiding and release it to God so that's that's the first step is to release the second is rebuild and restore rebuild and restore your soul one of the things that you need to do to rebuild and restore your soul is you need to make a people Exchange this is a not always an easy thing to do but this is the moment in your life when you're rebuilding and restoring your life that you must insist that you do not have the wrong people in your life you don't need people in your life anymore that are going to rub it in or hold you to your past at some point you've got to move on from that and they can come with you or you can leave them behind but you need to make sure that these are people that are helping you to rebuild and restore your soul you need people that will be like God and make you lie down in Green Pastures and lead you beside Quiet Waters you see we live in a culture that loves to kick people when they're down I mean we love it somebody Falls boom we're all on it go to social media for a minute and it's pretty easy to see like probably at two o'clock this afternoon you'll find somebody else in America that messed up and people are piling on right it takes it doesn't take it but a second but God what's God do God takes a bruised Reed and does not break it he takes a smoldering Wick and does not snuff it out why because the Holy Spirit the spirit of God is a rebuilding and restoring spirit and it the holy spirit is the only one that can actually help you to build back better in your life the third thing you need to do is you need to reset your life you gotta press reset on your life somebody say reset you got to press reset on your life you know back with the dinosaur computers um back when you know like 15 years ago when you had a computer when dinosaurs used them the when your computer was not doing well you would just press reset yeah you'd reset your computer and everything was miraculously better I don't know how to do it today I can't even figure out my own computer but you got to reset your life sometimes Proverbs 24 says for though a righteous man falls seven times how many times does he fall seven he rises again you would think a righteous man would not fall seven times that would be incorrect righteous people fall what makes them righteous is getting back up getting back up makes you righteous also try not to fall so much but get back up if you do hmm what do we have to do we have to learn to Rise Up from the place of failure to reset our thinking pattern sometimes our thinking gets all whacked and out out of line and it buys into all kinds of inter incorrect things we've got to reset our thinking pattern we need to reset our vocabulary our words our vocabulary I'm not talking about swearing although that would be a good idea as well okay so we can reset I mean I can't I can't I just can't [Music] it would be okay it would be okay if you stop swearing that would be fine but what I'm talking about is the words that you say that deceive yourself this is how you learn to walk on out of the land if uh if only I had never if only I hadn't if only I wasn't such a whatever happens to be see these are all like words that take you down the wrong path instead learn to reframe your words to ask what if I start responding to God's love for me what if I respond truly to the Forgiveness of God what if I truly respond to the power of God what if that's a much better way that's a much better way and direction to go with your words what if I really let God love me for real let him love me what if I really truly begin to understand that God is for me and not against me and you also need to reset your hearing how do you reset your hearing do you know that there's a lot of things to hear these days a lot of things to listen to there's five thousand there's like 5 000 YouTube things that you can watch in a minute Tick Tock all over your hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing right but not everything you hear is good and sometimes the things that you are hearing actually present like they are good things to hear but they are in fact not we're warned about this in Scripture reset our hearing learn to listen to God's word like what it is that God's word says so that helps us to move from repetitious failure into repetitious success one time Jesus ran into a rather sinful woman that we know in the Bible as a Samaritan woman he met her at a well one afternoon and as they were talking Jesus was helping this woman to reset her thinking see she had been looking for love and Security in all the wrong places and now finally she has encountered Jesus and is discovered pure love and Ultimate Security in Jesus and he's not going to hold her past against her rather he is already started to rebuild her life Jesus has the most unique way of helping us to get back up from fail failure and to learn to fail forward instead of being stuck in the past of failure he helps us to walk out of our past failures well after Jesus was resurrected from the dead he went one day to find Peter Peter who had denied him three times in his most desperate of moments Peter had failed in a rather public way John chapter 21 pick up the story several of the disciples were there Simon Peter Thomas Nathanael the sons of Zebedee two other disciples Simon Peter said I'm going fishing we'll come too they all said so they went out in the boat but they caught nothing all night now pause if you're new to the Bible you won't know this if you're old to the Bible you might know this this happened to Peter before this exact scene happened to Peter once before out going fishing not catching anything and then something really cool happens so just keep that in mind at dawn Jesus was standing on the beach but the disciples couldn't see who it was he called out fellas have you caught any fish no they replied then he said throw out your net on the right side of the boat and you'll get some now pause again two important things first since Jesus has been resurrected Peter hasn't seen him probably he's been hiding probably embarrassed he was the top dog and he went to the Bottom Rung just like that it's probably embarrassed and two remember when Jesus first called Peter a few years earlier to be his disciples it was in the exact same situation Peter had been out fishing and not caught anything and Jesus told him to drop the Nets same exact situation so when Peter hears this Unknown man we can't see through the fog say put down your nets that's what a music would play if it were a movie okay it's it's his heart just started racing you know it did what if it's Jesus but I wonder could it even get that far could he could he even dare to believe that Jesus had come for him but could it be possible that Jesus had come to see him is it possible that even though his other fellow disciples had told him Jesus was alive maybe he didn't really believe it all the way is it possible that Jesus really is alive so worship team comes up the Bible goes on so they did meaning they let down the Nets so they couldn't haul in the net because there were so many fish in it then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter it is the Lord when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put on his tonic for he'd stripped for work jumped in to the water and headed to shore he didn't even want to wait for the boat to get back into the beach he jumped right out he's swimming he's running through the water which has got to be an awkward scene have you ever tried to run through the water right you know it's not easy to do so at this moment Jesus is reaching out to Peter Jesus is resetting Peter's life from failure to forgiveness from failure to renewal from failure to A Renewed purpose A Renewed call the first time that Jesus called Peter with the fish miracle he was calling Peter to be a fisher of men this time he's restoring Peter by performing the same Miracle to remind Peter I'm not done with you yet we're just getting started remember this kind of a god is the god who didn't give up on Adam I mean I I would give up on Adam I would give up on Adam but God didn't give up on Adam God didn't give up on Moses God didn't give up on Elijah he kept going after him and God didn't give up on King David and we all think he should have but God did it and it kept going after him and God didn't give up on Peter listen to me friends [Music] God didn't give up on any of those guys so please don't give up on God because God won't ever give up on you and if you and if you are here today and you don't have anything left today don't give up and if you want to throw in the towel and you wanted to throw in the towel since the moment you went to sleep last night don't give up and if you want to pick up and it's driving you crazy don't give up and if you want to give up on life hold on a little bit longer don't give up don't give up on God don't give up on you because God won't give up on you not now not ever amen amen all right stand with me would you stand with me across this room everybody stand up today the worship team is going to lead us at this but let's respond if there's a failure you need to give to God give it to God today if there's a peace that you need to get about a past failure give it to God today release it let him rebuild you let him restore you let him come after you today whatever it is you need to do with God do that today the altars are open [Music]", "everyone i'm christina and i'm pastor emily and i'm on staff at east coast international church and this is our holy week podcast this week we're going to be taking a look at every step that jesus took from palm sunday to easter sunday by looking through a bunch of scriptures as we follow the steps of jesus we'll also be looking back at some old testament passages and forward to what this means to us we hope you guys enjoy now let's get into it [Music] hello everyone and happy wednesday happy wednesday i hope you guys are enjoying your day so far we're gonna pick up as usual with the steps of jesus during holy week with this wednesday and it's right in smack dab in the middle between his triumphal entry and his resurrection um and things are heating up what what's wednesday called there's a name for wednesday is there is it like nope i'm thinking what monday is that a thing i always think that's wednesday because it's starting because it's up to the w no but i was thinking you know how i had a cool name for tuesday yesterday which was two weeks tuesday i was like oh this could be restful wednesday oh like with a w wow i almost wrote it and then i was like wait this is a podcast so it's not going to come through said it never said it all right it's okay we spelled it out for you guys i have a problem wednesday with the wr yep that's what it is i hope your wednesday is restful wednesday for jesus from what we know from scripture was a day of rest possibly and definitely a day of preparation for him and those around him so today i'm reminded that god is at work in our rest god is at work in our rest i love that because even when you feel like you're not doing you're not getting something accomplished god is always accomplishing things and so there is something beautiful about resting in god and i think um jesus kind of leads the way with this so we do learn from the gospels that one of the gospels says that jesus went daily to the temple to teach so there's a possibility that he went and taught at the temple but as we know from yesterday the pharisees weren't going to challenge him yeah they're not asking any more questions yeah so um so if he did go to the temple to teach it was probably like a really peaceful and beautiful and lovely time yeah of being with people and then he went back to bethany and was around his closest loved ones and spent times spent time kind of like enjoying their company and preparing himself for what was ahead so today i wanted to take a look at what is going on in the hearts and minds and lives of jesus and the people around him during this time and one of the things that i wanted to focus on is really having like a kind of a meditative and prayerful approach as we look at wednesday for holy week a lot of times as westerners we're looking for okay what does this mean for me what am i supposed to do what do i what do i need to do what's the takeaway um but i think that there are a couple of prayers that i want to highlight just that kind of i thought up and perhaps you as you're listening will think of other things to pray but i think that there are ways that we can just look at how others were being and pray that god would help us to be like that or help us not to be like that and so as jesus is taking this day to rest i just wanted to pray together god may i rest and as i rest god prepare me for what's ahead the next thing i wanted to look at comes straight out of matthew chapter 26 so christina would you read that passage for us yes so matthew 26 verses 6 to 13. meanwhile jesus was in bethany at the home of simon a man who had previously had leprosy while he was eating a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head the disciples were indignant when they saw this what a waste they said it could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor but jesus aware of this replied why criticize this woman for doing such a good thing to me you will always have the poor among you but you will not always have me she has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial i tell you the truth wherever the good news is preached throughout the world this woman's deed will be remembered and discussed and that's exactly what we're doing today yeah every time i read that verse i'm like that is so cool that's awesome yeah um so one of the things that this is just kind of like a geeky bible uh bible trivia knowledge for you um or maybe not i mean if you're a scholar this is not just trivia and if you're someone who's attentive to detail and you're concerned about the chronology of what happened then this is important to know um but there are several stories one in each gospel of jesus being anointed by a woman and the question is are those stories all of the same event or of separate events and if they're of separate events when did they happen and kind of which story connects with which story interesting so i've always been confused about all the mary's because there's so many mary's in jesus's life there's mary his mother there's mary magdalene there's mary the brother of lazarus and um you know it just has always been confusing to me uh and i think that that's kind of similar with this story there's four passages that talk about the anointing of jesus and there's a few different ideas about how it went down there could be three different times jesus was anointed there could be two different times there could be one different time based on how exactly you look at it it's hard to say with certainty exactly when this happened but i chose this passage because for me it seems most plausible that there's at least two separate times that jesus was anointed by a woman and possibly three i think it's very likely that there were three three different times and one of those times happened during holy week so this passage if it matches the stories the way that i think it does the woman who was anointing jesus was mary not mary magdalene but mary the sister of lazarus who was just raised from the dead and i love this story i love the way that jesus says that she was anointing him for his burial because i wonder did mary know that she was doing that what what is it that mary thought she was doing yeah and why was she doing it and i think you know pastor kurt referenced this passage actually he read a different um passage one that i i think actually happened at another time but um but he referenced the story of jesus being anointed and there's a lot of similarities between them and he said you know culturally we don't have a lot of resonance with this practice of anointing somebody and certainly it wasn't a common thing to do in jesus day and age either you can see that because the disciples are kind of like what is like yeah what are you doing like it was extravagant what was done a very expensive perfume the type of thing that would last somebody for years that would cost somebody tons of money was broken open and put over jesus in one moment first of all this is just maybe a side side note but if you had somebody pour an expensive bottle of cologne on you like can you imagine how that would smell like you would be like whoa have you ever like been walking down the street and like someone walks by and you're like oh you did not need to bathe an axe like when you stepped out the door today it's too much yeah and to be honest that person probably only put like right like maybe three four maybe maybe maybe ten i mean maybe ten but still not a whole bottle yeah yeah so like this is pretty intense thing that just happened this crazy strong smell i'm sure um was happening but it was this extravagant honor and worship and it was clearly something done as a gift to jesus something done because jesus is worthy because jesus is worth it it was something to show how much this person valued jesus yeah so i call it worship and so mary was worshiping jesus and jesus says that she did a nice thing to him and that she anointed him for his burial now i don't know if mary knew that i don't know if mary had understood that jesus was going to die because jesus was talking about his death and his resurrection but as we know from reading jesus's words he wasn't always like crystal clear and when he was some of the things he said were so like hard to understand that yeah it still went over people's heads you know so i mean the disciples definitely did not seem to realize that he was going to die because after he died they were all like what do they do now yeah they were like in dismay and so i question whether or not mary knew but what i do see here is you've got two groups of people you've got mary who is worshiping jesus and in worshiping jesus she is doing something prophetic i notice a lot of times that when you worship jesus your worship oftentimes is inadvertently prophetic what do i mean by prophetic i mean a lot of times when you spend time reflecting on and looking at and adoring and placing value and glorifying god it it's not just like like a note for that moment it releases like the truth of who god is into your life in a really powerful and beautiful way and so i just think it's so cool that this woman was able to step into the story of jesus's final and most important moments on the earth just because she wanted to worship him yeah she wanted to worship him and she placed immense value on jesus and the disciples were frustrated by this they criticized and one of the gospels points out judas in particular who was really unhappy with this and we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a second but it wasn't just jews it was all the disciples were kind of like what is going on this is this is too much but i love this story and i wanted to just as we reflect on it and as we contemplate and meditate on what was going on in holy week i want to pray as i read the story god may i be the worshiper and not the criticizer before you jesus may i always be the worshiper and not the criticizer may i never be guilty of criticizing you or holding back on giving you all that you're worth or criticizing those who do may i be the worshipper i want to be mary in the story i don't want to be the disciples criticizing her in this moment so that's my prayer from this story i wanted to also read a passage in john as we continue and we're not sure exactly when jesus said these words that i'm about to read but it's a pretty good chance that he said it on wednesday so the passage we're reading is john chapter 12 starting in verse 20. some greeks who had come to jerusalem for the passover celebration paid a visit to philip who was from bethsaida in galilee they said sir we want to meet jesus philip told andrew about it and they went together to ask jesus jesus replied now the time has come for the son of man to enter into his glory i tell you the truth unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies it remains alone but its death will produce many new kernels a plentiful harvest of new lives those who love their life in this world will lose it those who care nothing for their their life in this world will keep it for eternity anyone who wants to serve me must follow me because my servants must be where i am and the father will honor anyone who serves me now my soul is deeply troubled should i pray father save me from this hour but this is the very reason i came father bring glory to your name then a voice spoke from heaven saying i have already brought glory to my name and i will do so again when the crowd heard the voice some thought it was thunder while others declared an angel had spoken to him then jesus told them the voice was for your benefit not mine the time for judging this world has come when satan the ruler of this world will be cast out and when i am lifted up from the earth i will draw everyone to myself he said this to indicate how he was going to die the crowd responded we were we understood from scripture that the messiah would live forever how can you say the son of man will die just who is this son of man anyway jesus replied my light will shine for you just a little longer walk in the light while you can so the darkness will not overtake you those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going put your trust in the light while there is still time then you will become children of the light after saying these things jesus went away and was hidden from them but despite all the miraculous science jesus had done most of the people still do not believe in him this is exactly what isaiah the prophet had predicted lord who has believed our message to whom is the lord revealed his powerful arm such an incredible passage i'd love to hear from you christina about that old testament passage but before i do just just kind of summarize real quick what was happening in this really unique passage in john chapter 12 verse 20 to 38 jesus is really meditating on his death that's coming and he's like you can see this like tug of war inside of him that he doesn't want to die he doesn't want to be murdered i mean who who does you know but at the same time he's being obedient to god we see the same intentionality that we saw at the triumphal entry jesus despite how heavy his burden is he is being obedient to god and he's charging his disciples with following him and that he's saying listen you've got to be like me my servants are where i am and you can't love your life so much that you're not willing to lose it because that's how you lose your life so my prayer as i read this would be may i be like jesus god help me to be like jesus in dying to my flesh to myself help me to walk in jesus footsteps that's good yeah i want to share from isaiah 53 john quotes it or jesus quotes it and i just i i want to read this passage i want to take the opportunity to read through it because it amazes me every time i look at it just that isaiah had no idea um what was going to happen and how god was going to uh carry out his his plan of salvation uh and yet this passage is is here in the bible uh hundreds of years before jesus came to earth and it's such a beautiful portrayal of what he did um and so i just i just want to take the time to read isaiah 53 it says who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed he grew up before him like a a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground he had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him nothing in his appearance that we should desire him he was despised and rejected by mankind a man of suffering and familiar with pain like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised and we held him in low esteem surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering yet we considered him punished by god stricken by him and afflicted but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed we are like sheep we all like sheep have gone astray each of us has turned to our own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open up his mouth he was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before it shearers is silent so he did not open his mouth by oppression and judgment he was taken away yet who of his generation protested for he was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people he was punished he was assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth yet it was the lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the lord makes his life an offering for sin he will see his offspring and prolong his days and the will of the lord will prosper in his hand after he has suffered he will see the light of life and be satisfied by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities therefore i will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with the strong because he poured out his life unto death and was numbered with transgressors for he bore the sins of many and many intercession and made intercession for the transgression aggressors um and i i really like that part in john when it talks about um look to the light while it's still here and you'll become children of light and it just like this passage talks about not seeing jesus for who he was seeing him as like despised and unattractive and and just lowly um but really he's the king of kings come to take our sins and our transgressions on himself and to suffer and and like jesus jesus knew suffering and and as we read through these scriptures we see him preparing for that great suffering before him yeah all at the same time acknowledging that he is the king of kings that he is the messiah that he will bring peace that he he will reign on david's throne um and so it's it it just speaks to the importance of seeing jesus for who he is yeah wow it's such a high impossible standard that jesus said is yeah his life and the way that he died and to even think like that we could be like jesus in the way he died is sometimes hard i think to reconcile yeah in my own mind because jesus died for the sins of the world yeah and like i can cannot can do no such thing i can't even you know i can't even you know cover my own sins you know so how how is it that i could be like him and yet that's exactly what he's inviting us to do to follow in his footsteps with him carrying really the weight of everything that needs to be carried right he's gone before us he's made the way and it's because of his suffering and his sacrifice and what he already did that we we can do the same yeah absolutely it's like i think of it like almost like um like a really thick jungle right that's like so thick that it's difficult to navigate and jesus went ahead of us and he blazed the trail yeah and so it's because he did that that we can follow in his footsteps um and he did the hard work you know of like creating a pathway through an impossible um situation but um he asks us to follow us and that's exactly what lazarus was doing he's the other one of the other characters i wanted to look at today lazarus had just died you know a short time prior to this was dead for a few days and then came back to life jesus raised him back to life which to me is like wow like that's wild what a way to like share in jesus's story and to kind of be marked by jesus and jesus was about to die and come back to life but lazarus actually did that before him right lazarus didn't do it on his own dime he did it on jesus that like jesus is the one who did the miracle but yeah um lazarus was like jesus he was jesus friend he was close to him and his family was close to him he was one of jesus's disciples not one of the twelve but he was one of the ones who was close to him and he was a follower of jesus in in every sense of the word and then we read in john chapter 12 that that lazarus was just like jesus not only because of his life but also because he became now a target for the pharisees verses 9 through 11 it says when all the people heard of jesus arrival they've walked to see him and also to see lazarus the man jesus had raised from the dead then the leading priests decided to kill lazarus too for it was because of him that many of the people had deserted them and believed in jesus and so here is lazarus who died already got his life back and now his life is in jeopardy once again because he is telling everyone about what jesus has done for him so when i see lazarus and when i think about jesus kind of resting and preparing and what are all the people around him doing and how can i be like them i see lazarus and i think yeah that's exactly i want to be like lazarus i want to be like jesus dying to my flesh and living for him and sharing with sharing in everything that jesus has for me and one of the third the third person that i want to look at we looked at mary we've looked at lazarus and now i want to look at judas who was also there that day and this was the day that judas decided to betray jesus wednesday this is the day that judas was tempted into stepping away from all the other disciples and going and secretly meeting with the pharisees and saying you know what i know you guys are trying to figure out how to get rid of him and i will help you in exchange for money and one of the gospels tells us judas was one of the people that was upset because mary gave this extravagant gift to jesus and judas was like well that could have been sold and the money could have been you know been used for ministry and the gospel calls him out and says he said this because he was a thief and he was stealing money for himself from jesus ministry fund which is kind of crazy to think about like jesus was doing ministry jesus who knows like everything had a guy who was skimming off the top of his ministry fund and how interesting that jesus kind of continued to walk with him and let him follow him and continue to to you know he never he never um reamed judas or kicked him out of the circle or anything like that jesus kind of gave judas every chance um and i when i hear the story of judas i don't know if this is gonna sound crazy to people but when i hear the story of judas i feel a sense of um like his weaknesses resonate with me [Music] and i just think you know judas did a horrible thing probably the most horrible thing that any human has ever done yeah but he was this like selfish you know he was weak he was this weak person and he was tempted into this horrible thing of exchanging what was so important in following jesus exchanging this ministry that jesus was was passing on to his disciples exchanging time with jesus for more money and we know later that judas wasn't able to cope with the guilt of what he did and he ended up killing himself but i i i wonder if jesus would have forgiven him i believe like that jesus grace is big enough even for judas yeah and we know that peter betrayed jesus i mean we know that judas wasn't the only sinner that jesus loved and had around him and so i see judas falling into this horrible trap on wednesday yeah and being around jesus and being around these people who were following jesus and being like jesus and he instead turned away from jesus and was tempted and he traded his place beside jesus for money and so when i see jesus story on this wednesday of holy week um i i want to pray god may i never turn from jesus may i never trade the eternal for the material and i think in small ways we can we can succumb to that same temptation so often yeah it is so easy for us to exchange things that are eternal and things that are glorious and things that god has for us for material things that are going to be gone in just a short amount of time and i don't want to fall into that trap i don't want to be guilty of that so hopefully this was helpful to you we're going to close in prayer but just as a recap for today wednesday was a day of rest and preparation god is at work in the rest and i hope that today you also get an opportunity to rest that this week you have a chance to rest and that as you rest that you would be in a place where god is able to prepare you for what's ahead that's the kind of rest that i want to experience rest where i'm not just recovering from what's happened to me but rest where i'm actually preparing for what's ahead of me and so i just pray that god blesses you and is with you and gives you that kind of rest and helps to invigorate your relationship with him as you continue to meditate on holy week christina do you want to close us in prayer yes jesus i thank you for this time and i pray that you would give everyone listening rest lord and that it would prepare them for what's ahead god i pray that through rest we would be able to be strengthened for the plans that you have for us god and for the work that's ahead and i pray that you would continue to bring us back to times of rest god and reel us in lord and i pray that um i pray that we would reflect on whether we're being like mary whether we're being like lazarus god whether we're uh being critical or worshiping god and whether we're able to look forward to the the things in eternity god or whether we're keeping our eyes on what's um immediately in front of us lord which which is so easy to do and i just pray that you would continue to draw us every day to uh analyzing our priorities and that you would become the center of our lives god that yes that our lives would be to glorify you and to worship you and to put you for first and to work towards um your plans god and not towards earthly plans and not towards material gain um but towards uh what you have for us jesus and i pray that you would bless every person listening god that you would go with them throughout today and that you would speak to them god and give them new strength god and give them new ideas and new inspiration and just a liveliness to serve you with joy and to worship you with joy and with strength god and i pray that we would be like you jesus even in the face of death that we would be like you perseverant and just fully in love with you god and fully willing to put it all on the line for you god because you gave everything for us and you will protect us every everything that we go through you will protect us and if if you did it you went before us you made the way then we can do it too god and i pray holy spirit that you would continue to remind us of that and i thank you jesus in your precious name i pray amen amen [Music] all right thank you so much guys for joining us we hope you have a good [Music] in your day that you died [Music] if my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] of all the children", "[Music] we already uh did this morning we'll make sure that you're all individually praying uh for the people of ukraine and all those that are serving in that area of the world again uh if you'd like to give anything to the compassion related ministries or refugee ministries and the church center app you can just go to the ukraine button and give 100 of what you give will be given out we won't we don't take any kind of fee off the top of that so please make sure that if if you're compelled to give in that direction that you have the opportunity to do so tonight on the second floor we have our lead meeting we have not had an in-person lead meeting in a very long time and these are normally quarterly and so if you are serving in any capacity here in the church i would invite you to come out this evening or if you're getting ready to start serving in any capacity please come on out to this as well tonight we will be um giving really a pandemic report uh like how did the church do during the pandemic very well but uh we want to make sure that you have an opportunity to hear that report in person here this evening on the second floor on the second floor now in your on the way in you received a card it's either pink or blue there's no no real reason why it was pink or blue but just uh you can pick it up and what i'd want you to do is i want you to put your name on it your real name uh on it and so i'm gonna put my name on mine and then if during the service you are bored or something make little doodles uh on on this and but just just make sure it has your your name on it and you'll have opportunity to use that later on in the service several years ago my family had a guest over to our home for dinner and we sat down to eat and our guest got up and went outside and then they came back in and we waited quite a few minutes for them to come back in when they came back in we we sat down at the table again and we we prayed and then as soon as we started to eat our guests got back up and went outside again and we had invited the guests over to spend time with them but they kept going outside this happened several times and was quite unexpected eventually we figured out that our guest was having small panic attacks they were having panic attacks because it turns out that they had never eaten at a family dinner table before they had also never eaten with a family before and to us our guest was just an extension of our family but to our guest this was a seemingly impossible truth that our table that at our table she was accepted and wanted and loved and valued not a burden to us that her presence was a blessing and an honor to us she did not understand that we were inviting her to be a part of our extended family or maybe she did not understand or maybe she did understand and it was simply too complicated for her and that's because family can be complicated sometimes nobody said amen very good very good family can be complicated but everybody needs it and even if your origin story is complicated something within you still yearns for this elusive sense of family as you try to create it in your life so if the word family gives you anxiety this morning it's okay we're gonna walk you through how to be part today of a different family of god's family you see god has a family and it involves people you were created i want you to hold these truths today very closely you were created to be part of god's family but what is the family of god when god reveals himself to us he uses the language of family he calls himself father it's when he identifies himself as father he is using this language of family what it turns out the word father is a complicated word today as well even when jesus taught us how to pray this is jesus he says this when you pray don't babble on and on i wish we could just stop right there okay but there's more here okay as the gentiles do they think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again don't be like them there it is again don't don't be like them for your father knows see the word father somebody say father you in search the word father your father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him pray like this our father in heaven there's that word father is again jesus is identifying god the father as father once again using language of family jesus's son god is father may your name be kept holy may your kingdom come soon may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven our father language of family language of sonship and daughtership there it is jesus is referring to god as his father he helps us to see that god should be viewed as our father as well yet in a complicated world where the word father has lost much of its sacredness because so many have been unsuccessful at being a good father people have simply forgotten what it even means or what it's supposed to mean father what is a father father is a protector a provider the father is one who is present present in life the father is one who prays for his children the father is a teacher a father is a leader father is one who corrects father is one who comforts the father is one who inspires the father is one who encourages father is one who sets an example and a father is one who never ever ever ever gives up on his children those are all biblical ideas of fatherhood and yet we have lost much of the sacredness of this but god identifies himself as father and jesus identifies his father as our father as well so god sets this example of being a good good father and throughout scripture reinforces this idea repeatedly that he is father romans 8 the fantastic passage in scripture romans 8 chapter 15 starts so you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves instead you received god's spirit so you receive god's spirit when do you receive god's spirit it comes up right here when he adopted you as his own children so here we again have this language of god and family and god adopting us as his children now there's an underlying implication there which is that why did god need to adopt us that's because we weren't his children but now we are now we call him abba father somebody say abba abba abba father for his spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are god's children and since we are his children we are his heirs in fact together with christ we are heirs of god's glory we call god abba father this abba word means father but it's the familiar word word version of the word father it would be the closest use of the word in the english language would be the word daddy when a child calls their father daddy it carries with it a sense of title honor and privilege all at the same time the privilege of being a child it would be weird if a child that wasn't my own started to call me daddy that would be strange but my children can call me that and it isn't odd or unusual because it's true and if god is your father and you don't understand that god is your father in the daddy sense of that word then you misunderstand god the type of good father that he is and because you don't understand him as a good father you miss out on much of his love for you and so it's important to understand the language of family as god refers to himself in this language and as a good father now while it is accurate the god is not your homeboy he's still your daddy he is our father not in some distant ancient wizard kind of way that must be appeased and i think that much of of humanity perceives god to need to be approached as following see this come on um tell me what it's over look at that look at that [Music] [Applause] [Music] who are you who are you if you please i am dorothy the small and meek we've come to ask you island [Music] the great and powerful eyes knows why you have come step forward tin man [Music] you dare to come to me for a heart do you you clinking clanking clattering collection of collagenous junk oh [Music] yes yes sir yeah yes your honor you see a while back we were walking down the yellow brick road and [Music] a new scarecrow and ask for their brain you billowing bale of bovine fodder [Music] yes your honor i mean your excellency i mean uh your wizardry enough and you lion [Music] well all right so this is uh just a silly illustration of what so many people uh perceive their need to approach god by it is some distant powerful hopefully benevolent god but probably not there's this there's this sense of of having to jump through all kinds of hoops to go but that's not how god asks us to understand him in scripture god is not the wizard and we should not approach him that way it's it's encroaches upon offensive to god for us to even approach him that way a complete misunderstanding of who he is and what he wants to be in our lives in ephesians chapter 1 it says this even before he made the world god loved us and chose us in christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes god decided in advance to adopt us there's that adopt word again adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through jesus christ this is what he wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure that's what the scripture says it gave him great pleasure to bring us into his family and so god sends jesus to invite us into his family and so jesus invited us to pull up a seat at the table of god and so at the table of god we are invited to come over for dinner and lunch and breakfast not because we are coming over but because this is where we belong now not as a guest but as brothers and sisters with jesus that means this if you're not eating at the seat at the table you're misunderstanding that there is a seat for you if you're at the seat at the table and you think you're renting it you're also misunderstanding it the seat belongs to you it has your name on it to be part of the family means to understand that there is a seat at the table for you when i was younger i would go to visit my friends at their farms and we would go out catching crawdaddies in the crick in the woods i'm sure you've all done that we'd go out chasing escaped chickens or tipping cows or something like that and we would hear this magic sound late in the afternoon and the magic sound was this it was when their mom would step out on the kitchen porch and ring the dinner bell literally ringing the dinner bell and it was a signal that for all the kids in that family it was time for the children to come home for dinner the bell belonged to them the sound of the bell they knew hey that's my bell it's time for me to go to dinner i was always a guest but i wasn't a child at those homes when you accept the invitation of jesus to join god's family it comes with all of the rights and privileges and responsibilities of family meaning when the dinner bell rings it's time to come home for dinner it also means you get to come home for dinner and get this in god's kingdom and in his family there are no second class children there's no second class kids and the bell is for all of the kids not just some ephesians chapter 2 verse 19 says so now you gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners you are citizens along with all god's holy people you are members of god's family no matter what no matter what your past no matter your abilities or disabilities no matter your nation or family of origin no matter if you are broke super broke or wealthy no matter how much time you served in prison no matter how many years you wasted chasing bright lights in the big city when you are adopted by god you are irrevocably his forever and ever and there's always a seat at his table for you so if you're here today and you have never responded to the invitation of jesus to be part of god's family listen carefully he offers you a seat at his table simply respond to jesus ask him to forgive you of your sins and to to lead your life let jesus show you what to do with your life it's time if you've never done it it's time to claim your seat at the table that name tag that you made earlier if you've never claimed your seat at the table of god before you leave the building today claim your seat at the table put your name on the seat we have a couple of chairs up here for to help you with that at the end of the service just drop it off on the chair before you leave today so i am hopeful that you will remember this moving forward when you are inviting people to explore god to consider the claims of jesus and the truth of scripture you are inviting them to have a seat at the table to be part of the family of god the second thing i want to make sure you capture this morning is that there are no inferior children in god's kingdom none even if you've been naughty don't be afraid don't be afraid of god's discipline he still invites you to the table the seat is still there for you the discipline of god is much more merciful than the promotions of satan and this world in the trappings of this world do we develop this family how do we develop this fit in the family of god well a few things to remember first off the church is part of the family of god it's not a social club there are social things that happen but it's not a social club we are not a community service organization even though we do serve the community the church is a blend of two things the church in its best version is these two things an army and a family blended together it's not just an army and it's not just a family it's both at our best we are the great power we can bring hope into hopeless situations healing into broken places freedom into captive places reconciliation into angry moments hope to the hopeless wisdom into confusion truth to corrupt systems voices for the oppressed and so much more because we are an army the army of god but we are also a family a special family tasked with special family rules we have family rules so consider the next couple of minutes family meeting these are the family rules in case you didn't know what they were like i got rules yes you have so many rules it's awesome you don't just have to figure life out on your own it's already figured out for you we just have to follow romans 12 don't just pretend to love others that's a good rule don't pretend to love people really love them hate what is wrong those are three rules already you got that hold tightly to what is good love each other with genuine affection genuine affection i have to reflect on that what does affection mean take delight in honoring each other what does honoring each other look like never be lazy he says love when the bible uses words like never never never be lazy and work hard and serve the lord enthusiastically rejoice in our confident hope be patient in trouble and keep on praying we're not even halfway done when god's people are in need be ready to help them always be eager to practice hospitality see these are the easy ones so far bless those who persecute you it's really in there it's verse 14 you can double check don't curse them pray that god will bless them be happy with those who are happy and weep with those who weep live in harmony with each other don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people and don't think you know it all this is getting hard never pay back evil with more evil do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable do all that you can to live in peace with everyone dear friends never take revenge leave that to the righteous anger of god for the scripture says i will take revenge i will pay them back says the lord instead if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink in doing this you will keep burning coals of shame on their heads don't let evil conquer you but conquer evil by doing good those are the family rules those are family rules for us to follow that's what we're supposed to be doing and being think about that so i want you to highlight that passage in your bible nobody carries physical bibles with them anymore i want you to download this a bible app called the you version if you don't have it take a look at the passage this afternoon it's found in romans chapter 12. and i want you to pick the new living translation if you've never done this before there's a translation called nlt or new living translation romans chapter 12 and just spend the week reading that and asking yourself am i doing that am i doing that thing and then how can i do better at that thing listen we all have room to improve in most of these areas and uh so maybe don't try to improve in all of them tomorrow okay so pick one go for it it jesus even laid down some declarations in john chapter 13. he says this verse 34 so now i am giving you a new commandment love each other just as i have loved you you should love each other your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples so jesus is jumping in on the love bandwagon there as well lots of love going on here the family the family is to be a place where joys are multiplied and sorrows are divided the family is to be a place where there is always a seat at the table for you and we are talking about the family of god right now that's what this is for and so develop your family relationships develop your family of god you see the family of god is huge like there's millions and millions and millions of people in the family of god but in communities there are smaller groups of people we call them churches or local churches so i would encourage you to develop your family relationships as a church spend time with one another encourage one another challenge one another love one another pray for one another serve one another provoke one another submit to one another motivate one another be faithful to one another these are all things directly out of the bible these are the things that are difficult to begin with but they are impossible to do when you are not with each other the things we've talked about can't be done in isolation like you might be able to do one or two or three or four of them but you can't do them all when you are distant from each other we need to be away from the season of isolation that so many of us have been in for the last two years over the last two years i have noticed a distinct reality that is becoming harder for people to re-engage with community because we forgot how habits are hard to develop and when they are broken which we did over the last two years you have to relearn them and so coming out of isolation being super super intentional about putting these things into practice in your everyday life so the kinds of relationships that you need and we'll move quickly through through this as the worship team comes up i believe you fundamentally need four types of relationships like a four-legged stool right this stool has four legs in our life i believe we need four fundamental relationships i believe we need relationships in the family of god with people that you naturally connect with think of that as one leg people are like oh i like that person a lot those are the easy people right for you your personality your style but you also need people that you don't naturally connect with people that you might not even like you need those people in your life as well you just might have to deal with them put up with them you might need to figure out how to love them and make them something special in your life you need people in your life also to challenge you these are the people that challenge you provoke you stir you to make you better it's not just easy to hang out with them it's challenging to hang out with them because you're going to do something significant with them then you need a fourth group which is the group that mentor you you need people that mentor you now the reality is that sometimes you get to a place in your life i'm like i can't find anybody to mentor me that's what books are for there are other ways that people can mentor you and you don't even have to particularly know them but they can still mentor you during the pandemic we discovered how hard this was to be isolated from each other it was difficult to fulfill all of these things especially if you have no idea that there's a family member of yours in this community that is going through the most difficult season in their life and you had no idea because you're not present so i challenge you to engage with the family make sure that you are present with the family we have small groups at our church for you to be part of to assist you in developing relationships the groups themselves don't force relationship they're a tool that you can use to help develop relationships people that are going on a similar spiritual journey as you [Music] we do this because we want to give each other a chance to fulfill the highest mission of jesus which is to love each other love one another jesus kept saying it love one another be ridiculous in how much you love each other here's the truth the truth is i need you you need me and we need each other because we're family the family of god just a moment the worship team is going to close and as they do i want you to remember that there's a seat at god's table for you and before you leave this place today either while the worship team is is leading us in this song or on your way out we got a couple seats up here to help symbol symbolically represent a seat of god's table if you want to claim a seat at the table make sure you do so today [Music] if you are new to east coast international church we are hosting

how we doing this morning good it's good to be with you all here uh today if we haven't had a chance to meet my name is Jesse lobato and I have the amazing privilege of being one of the pastors here uh overseeing our youth ministry and all things media and I'm honored to be able to wrap up this Genesis series we've been in while Pastor Craig has been away in his mini sabbatical and I don't know about you guys but I kind of missed Pastor Kurt so I'm kind of excited to see him again um well this week but you guys will see him again next Sunday and uh don't tell him I said this but he called me yesterday because he came back to the States and I was like it's like the best thing to wake up to but you didn't hear that from me okay but I but I'm just glad that you know uh he's been able to go away and to kind of have it sabbatical but it's been great to uh to hear all of our other pastors speak every Sunday right uh it's been awesome it's really been awesome to just be able to work with them to be able to work closely with them during the summer and um I I just appreciate the the summer we've been able to have together just working so cohesively together and uh just like the great psalmist uh Drake once said uh man I love my team so we can give it up for our pastors again thank you about a year ago hawana and I along with our friend Cass drove 12 whole entire hours down to the Amish County in Ohio to pick up this six-week-old Aussie doodle who would quickly become like our best friend I couldn't tell you why we drove 12 hours for a dog I could say though that it was 100 worth it and I would do it all over again I think we have a picture of of my dude right there his name's also look how cute he is man he's just the best uh since that picture he's actually went from weighing 15 pounds to 75 so he's kind of a big dude now you see him right there yeah uh don't let the hair fool you he's bony as heck and it's very uncomfortable to cuddle with but he's a big big dog but uh since getting also one of the things hawana and I my wife wanted to make sure with him was that he was okay with being alone right you see I grew up with two tiny dogs and whenever anyone left the house for for whatever reason they would cry for the longest time like sometimes I feel like I could still hear their cries just like in my ears like right it's just so the most annoying thing it's always like babe also where this is not gonna happen we need to make sure that Oso is trained in a way that he will not bark just because we left so we would always try to leave him alone any moment we can I'm not saying I neglected my dog but any moment I didn't have to take him somewhere I didn't his crate is in the living room so he doesn't sleep with us um and one of the things that we do is whenever we have to clean like the kitchen area or or downstairs because our living room is upstairs we just leave them upstairs we'd even let him come down with us and what he's learned to do during this time is he's learned to entertain himself he's learned to play by himself he's gotten so good at playing by himself um now he like grabs his chew toys and will like Chuck him down the stairs so he can like fetch him like he literally learned how to play fetch by himself it's actually really adorable so anytime hawana and I leave him in the living room now as a 75 pound dog we can hear him playing by himself from downstairs because you know our floors are kind of thin and and like we hear things from like Toys dropping down the stairs we hear his like giant Paws walking uh if he's really hyper up there we could sometimes hear him jumping on furniture and it just like drags through the floor and even though sometimes it can sound like there's this like wild Stampede taking place right above us we're never concerned because we know that the noise that he's making is just him playing so we never have a problem with it well we do have a problem with is that one day we were cleaning uh doing our thing and also was making his usual loud noise and then at one moment it just went like silent and I was like oh well maybe he like actually tired himself out he went to bed so Juan and I ignored it we just went on our way and so we finished cleaning we go upstairs to relax and when we got up the stairs we just saw a bunch of this like cushiony type material all over the living room and in the middle was this bed I think we have the bed here this bed had a giant hole in it like and now you guys need to understand that's all like compressed material that was all spread throughout the whole living room and in the corner of the living room I remember also was just sitting looking at us like with the guiltiest face like he knew he messed up we got this bed for him and it wasn't cheap if you ever try to buy a bed for a 75 pound dog you won't find a cheap one and in a matter of a day or two he completely destroyed it and so now he just sleeps in his crate he enjoys it and we don't even bother trying to buy any other bed because he'll just tear it up and since then every time Oso has gone from Lao to silent hawana and I look at each other and we're like we just left something out that we were not supposed to leave out I mean we've had we have chewed up remotes with buttons that are coming off we have torn up paper towels that we left up there from cleaning we've even had our most favorite blankets to watch movies with all torn into shreds because this dude goes from loud to silent and in his silence just creates chaos and because of this what we've learned it's that it's never the noise that also makes that concerns us it's his silence because whenever also goes from like super loud and crazy to silent we know he's doing something wrong and I think it's safe to say that a lot of us are alerted by like a sudden silence right like maybe you have kids and they make all the noise in the world they're always like fighting with you all that stuff and in your house like you're hearing this chaos and you're like yeah that's just how it is but the minute they go silent right you just start thinking like what are these dudes up to like my mom knew that whenever me and my brother went silent I either hurt him he hurt me or we broke something so like the silence craze like this suspicion right or maybe you walk the same busy street at night and it doesn't matter what time of the night it is you just go fully confident that you'll be fine but then on the nights where those busy streets are all of a sudden empty and Silent you just start feeling the worst thing that there's someone behind you walking out at your pace and so you just start kind of bolting home just to make sure you don't get killed right you know what I mean and and like and even if you look at like movies right whenever you're watching the scene and it goes silence you're just you're waiting for that jump scare to come out of nowhere right and you start thinking the words like yo this girl is about to die right now and you're just like kind of like bracing yourself for it it seems that like the silence we experience in our lives is always the precursor to bad things happening we think that if there's silence it's because something's wrong and and for a lot of us it's because in silence bad things have happened to us right but if we're real with ourselves this morning sometimes the silence that we experience that causes great concern for our lives isn't when our dogs just go from loud to silent or when a busy street suddenly becomes empty and quiet but it's when God himself seems to have lost his voice in our lives right it's it's when we're in the midst of a rough situation and we've been stretching out to God and asking him to come through and to work on our behalf and have just been getting back silence wondering what in the world is he up to it's when we're in a place where it doesn't matter how much we've been reading or praying or or attending church God just feels so far and So Silent and out of that silence you begin to feel like you've been ignored by him abandoned by him and you even begin to question what you might be doing wrong and we've seen and we've been hearing about so many historical figures all throughout Genesis that have dealt with crazy suffering that have dealt with doubt that I've walked in the most disobedient of ways and in the midst of it right they heard from God in a miraculous way in the midst of it God met with them in a super natural way we've seen God have a conversation with Abraham about this great promise he had for him we've seen God speak to Hagar and her loneliest moments we've seen God sent angels to free lot and his family we've even seen God wrestle with Jacob and put the work on him right we've seen it happening and maybe you know we read those stories and we're like God like you did that all that for them but why isn't that happening in my life and we think as if this is the only way that he has to operate but in the life of a man named Joseph that we'll be diving into today we see that for him that that wasn't the case or his story see Joseph is one of the 12 sons of Jacob and Joseph was his dad's favorite and because he was his dad's favor he was hated by his 11 Brothers for it and we're introduced to the 17 year old Joseph in Genesis 37 who had this dream one night that he would rule over his brothers so Joseph did what anyone who had a dream of ruling over brothers who hated them would do he told them right like he told them he probably said in a little arrogant way and because of the dream they hated him even more because of it and then Joseph has another dream where now the dream's telling him you're not only going to rule over your brothers but you're going to rule over your whole family and so what does Joseph do he goes back to his brothers back to his family he said hey I'm not a rule over all of you guys and because of those dreams what we find is that Joseph was thrown into a pit by his brothers and then his brothers ended up faking his death to their father and then just so that they can profit off of Joseph they end up selling him into slavery and in this pit that Joseph found himself in this pit that he was brought to just because he communicated his dream we don't read of a direct message from God to Joseph that hey everything's going to work out I have a plan for you don't worry about it we don't see any miraculous intervention taking place like an angel swooping down and taking Joseph out of the pit all we read about is that Joseph is sold to a man in potiphar who was the main bodyguard of pharaoh the ruler of the nation at that time and even when things seem to be going well with uh with potiphar as Joseph went from slave to manager of Potiphar's house it quickly went South as Potiphar's wife tries to force Joseph to sleep with her and even though Joseph made all the right decisions refusing to do so even at one point having to physically run away from this woman she would end up falsely accusing Joseph of forcing himself on her which then puts him in prison without trial without a case for defense and Joseph would spend years in this prison and just like when he was in the pit we don't read of Joseph having a direct message from God that hey I'm gonna lead you out of this you'll be all right we don't read of any miraculous intervention taking place that would free Joseph from prison and you almost have to wonder what Joseph might have been thinking at this point right like after doing all of the right things to end up in all of the wrong places he probably wondered where God was in all of it he probably wondered if there was any hope for him now that he found himself in prison because it seems like through it all God is silent and we see a glimmer of hope as Joseph would gain favor over the prison Ward because Joseph became the manager over all the inmates and during this time as manager Pharaoh would send two of his officials to prison and while in prison both officials had these scary dreams That Shook them to the core that when they woke up Joseph saw that they were not at ease and so he asked them what's going on they both told him we had these crazy dreams and we have nobody to help us interpret them and so Joseph is like hey God is in the business of interpreting dreams so like explain it and when Joseph interprets the first official's Dream saying that Pharaoh would take him out of prison and restore him to his position as cup bear Joseph had one request for this cup Bearer and it was like hey this is what your dream means and when you get back into that place in your rightful position with Pharaoh please just remember me you see because to Joseph this would be his ticket out after being wrongfully sold by his brothers and wrongfully thrown into prison Pharaoh's cup Bearer could be the guy to get him out of all this just by simply mentioning Joseph to pharaoh and just three days later the dream comes true the cup bear is back in Pharaoh's Palace working but by this point he forgot all about Joseph forgot all about his request and this left Joseph in prison for another two years back at square one in the same place wondering where God was in all of this the moment life changed for the better for Joseph was when Pharaoh started to have some scary dreams too now and when no one in Pharaoh's Corner could interpret his dreams the cupbearer finally remembered Joseph and when they bring Joseph to interpret this dream listen to what he says in Genesis 41 verse 16. he says it is beyond my power to do this Joseph replied but God can tell you what it means and set you at ease here Joseph is face to face with arguably the most powerful man of his time this was his chance to finally get himself out out of the years of of of of wrongful accusations and suffering this would be the moment for Joseph to be like yes I am that guy I can do this and even if he couldn't interpret the dreams man if I was Joseph I would have just said something just so he can free me you know what I mean like that's what I would do but what did he do he looked at pharaoh and said hey it's beyond me but my God can do it and by faith Joseph was able to interpret Pharaoh's dream he was able to tell him about the seven years of prosperity that would take place in the land but then the seven years of famine that would come after and in order to prepare properly for what was about to happen Joseph said that Pharaoh should find an intelligent and wise man and put him in charge of the entire land of Egypt so Pharaoh looks takes in the advice says that's awesome and he looks at Joseph and says hey I want you to be that guy and what this meant was that Joseph would be second in command to a whole nation and to put it all into perspective this is all taking place 13 years after he was thrown into the pit and through all the jacked up things that took place in the life of Joseph what happened here was more than Joseph could ever have imagined and if we fast forward to when the famine came the nation was struggling for food and they all came to Joseph to buy supplies which included none other than his family and his brothers and and you'll find in Genesis that they have this wild exchange of events and at one point Joseph finally reveals to his brothers who he is and when his brothers realize that the one man who could provide them with the resources they needed during a Great Famine was none other than the brother whose death they faked it was none other than the brother that they sold into slavery and the Bible says that when they saw that this was Joseph they were terrified and the moment when Joseph could have had his payback for all that they put him through here's how he responds Genesis 45 says that then Joseph said to his brothers come close to me when they had done so he said I am your brother Joseph the one you sold into Egypt and now do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you for two years now there has been a famine in the land and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping but God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a Remnant on Earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance Joseph tells his brother to come close and like I'm sure all of us were thinking he was probably just going to do like a row of backhands right like when he came in but he tells his brothers hey don't worry about what you did don't be angry at yourselves on what you did because God is sending me ahead of you and I want to make it very clear that Joseph is not excusing his brothers from their evil actions nor is he saying that God was the one that caused those evil actions to happen but what he's saying is that God used the evil actions of man to further his Divine purposes for the life of Joseph says it another way in Genesis 50 20. he says you intended to harm me but God intended it all for good he brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people Joseph was not crediting himself for doing things on his own or scheming his own way out but he would say that it was the very hand of God that brought him through the pit that helped him survive through the prison and brought him to the promotion in Pharaoh's Palace that God brought him to this very point where he can now be used to help solve a national crisis and what we find is that even when God seems silent in Joseph's life Joseph still believed that God will see him through and God silence Joseph continued to trust and Obey through it all Joseph remains submitted to God even in what felt like the most silent moments when you read through Joseph's Journey it's hard to see how God is moving but when you can just get to the end and just look back you see that God was working in and through Joseph the whole entire time and what we learned from Joseph is just because God may feel silent in our lives does not mean that God is absent from our lives in the midst of God's silence three things remain evident in Joseph's life that I believe are true for us today and the first is that God's silence does not mean in absence of God's presence though we never read about any miraculous exchanges Joseph had we're told that he was never alone in Genesis 39 when Joseph was sold to potiphar verse 2 says that the Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered and he lived in the house of his Egyptian Master when he was wrongly thrown into prison later in verse 21 it says that the Lord was with them he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison Warden whatever high or low Point Joseph found himself at Genesis keeps this one consistent theme through it all and it's that the Lord was with Joseph and because the Lord was with Joseph he prospered in everything we did and I know it's such a simple truth to communicate but it's the truth we oftentimes have a hard time believing when God feels silent and the reason why is that far too often we base the certainty of God's presence on how we're feeling and on how life is looking well life is going great we know God is with us right we walk with that confidence when we feel the Goosebumps during worship we have all the faith in the world that God is moving in our midst but when the Trials come and the feelings fade we begin to think God where are you and why aren't you doing anything but church Faith is not a feeling it's the foundation of where our hope comes from and where our hope comes from is in the truth of God's word the word that says in Psalms 145 that the Lord is close to all who call on him yes to all who call on him in truth When Faith is just about feelings we're led to think that the true sign of a growing faith is when we can feel God more that that in order for me to grow as a Christian I need to feel God more in all places of life and as a result we think that the opposite is true that if I'm having a hard time feeling God it's because my faith isn't there or if I'm having a hard time feeling Gods because my faith is dying out and it's actually the false idea of this act does cause your faith to dwindle out because the true sign of growing faith is not when we can feel God more the true sign of growing faith is when we begin to develop less of a need to always have to feel God to know that he is with us that whether or not we have the Goosebumps or whether or not life is going exactly how we want it we still know that we are not alone because God is with us even if it was hard to see or feel the Lord was with Joseph and in helping him succeed in everything he did the second thing we learned that is evident about God's silence is that God's silence does not mean an absence of God's provision you see Joseph didn't gain favor from potiphar because of his skill set or Charisma Genesis 39 starting at verse 3 says that when his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the lord gave him success and everything he did Joseph found favor we see that it was God's Providence and Joseph's life that turned him from slaves to manager and even when he was thrown into a prison and it seemed like nothing could be done God provided favor again making him manager over the inmates and when the officials had terrible dreams they couldn't interpret it was God Who provided Joseph with the interpretation and even when the officials forgot about Joseph God never forgot about Joseph because we know from the story that the rest is history how many of us have ever heard of the verse of Philippians 4 13. I can do all things through him who gives me strength or I can do all things through Christ yeah right like we we love it right it's a highly used verse it's a verse I've heard a lot we love using it when it comes into walking New Opportunities or promotions or anything like that like like maybe if I walked in like during my freshman year of basketball trials with this verse like maybe I would have had different results if I didn't have it at the time man so but listen I believe we can do all things through Christ there's no doubt about it but Paul the Apostle was the one who wrote this and he wrote it not while waiting for a new job promotion or a new opportunity or a new door to open he wrote this while he was chained up in prison awaiting trial wondering if this was the end of his life and what he meant by it was hey whatever circumstance I find myself in no matter how hard life is going I can't do all things through him who gives me strength or another way to say is all things through him who provides me with strength only because God did not provide a way out of what Joseph was facing doesn't mean that God wasn't providing at all he wasn't providing a way out for Joseph but he for sure was providing a way through for Joseph in what he was facing whether it was through people positions or dreams Joseph was able to overcome every bit of difficulty people were putting him through purely because of the provision of God see God's provision over our lives may not always show up in him getting us out of something sometimes it may show up in him giving us the strength resources and wisdom to get through something and you'll often find that going through something will produce a lot more perseverance strength and character in your lives than just getting out of something you see through God's provision Joseph's character was developed through his provision he was able to work on his ability to interpret dreams and through God's provision Joseph was well equipped for the position of a lifetime and being second in command to pharaoh God's silence does not mean an absence of his presence it does not mean an absence of his provision and God's silence does not mean an absence of God's promise this is our theme that we've seen all throughout Genesis you see it turns out that Joseph's dream was not just some dream but God's plan on her he would continue to fulfill his promise that was made to Abraham and by Joseph working under Pharaoh his dream or or better yet God's plan and promise became a reality because in that moment Joseph became ruler over his family you see without Joseph his family would suffer under the famine that was taking place he was our one source of Aid that they had this dream this promise that so many people tried to destroy this dream that started to seem more and more like a fantasy to Joseph became a reality and here's why it's because even in God's most silent moments when it felt like everything that could go wrong went wrong God was still present providing and working behind the scenes to ensure that his promises became realized in the life of Joseph worship team you can come on up you see if I'm being honest I honestly don't know why God sometimes is loud in this time of my life and then he's quieting this time I honestly I can't tell you why you can feel him so evidently in some places and then in others you're wondering where he's even and honestly I'm not I'm not really here to give you an answer to that what I am here to say and the one thing that I can be absolutely sure of is that even when God feels silent and distant he is never still he is actively working and fighting on our behalf present providing and keeping the promises he's made to us very early right in my relationship with Jesus I felt the calling to pastor at the age of 16. and this would start a journey that would consist of all sorts of Trials and detours I mean I had to navigate on what being called to Pastor even meant especially being the only like believer in my home at the time a couple of years later at the start of my senior Year my one of my close friends who actually introduced me to Jesus passed away unexpectedly and I had to navigate the confusion and anger around that uh after my first year of Bible College I ended up having to leave because of finances this would lead me to travel to the other side of the country on a plane for the first time by myself for a nine month leadership program that only lasted six for a variety of reasons and through each trial though I did feel God through it all my prayers always felt heard I never lost faith and even in all the Hoops I had to jump through I still knew that God was there and the calling to pass it became a reality in 2021 when Pastor Curry offered the role to me and things felt great it felt awesome until last year it felt like God finally brought me to this place he promised me when I was a teenager and was like all right my man you got this from here I'll be over there and just just vanish like 2022 was a hard hard year for me I was getting sick every other month I started dealing with constant anxiety for the first time from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed I was feeling defeated every waking day and I honestly became scared to start my days because I just didn't want to deal with the weight anymore I remember I told Juan I I it just feels like I'm learning how to be like get punched in the face and be okay with it because it just that's how it felt it felt like everything that I did was failing and no matter what I tried to do or how much I tried to pray or read it always felt like I was just met with unchanging circumstances and a Silence from God and at one point I began to ask like what am I doing wrong God and why aren't you doing anything and I remember meeting with one of my friends Stefan explaining this struggle trying to figure out if there's anything practical I can do to get me out of this mess and I'll never forget it he just said bro if all you can do right now is just simply show up and be present just do your best at that and I'm not gonna lie at first I was like like what type of generic fortune cookie advice did you just give me bro right but what he meant was that even when it seemed like nothing was happening he was telling me to continue to trust and Obey that God is exactly who he says he is that he's called me to exactly where I'm at and that he will turn things around for me even if I don't hear feel or see it he was just telling me hey keep showing up so that's what I did when anxiety and discouragement were haunting me I did my best to show up to be a good husband show up ready to work Pastor to show up and be present in your lives when it was hard to feel God was hearing me I did my best to still show up in prayer and when his word just didn't make sense to me and it wasn't speaking back to me I just did my best to keep reading my Bible and if I'm honest with you guys I had spent the majority of 2022 anxious and discouraged all I was doing was just doing my best to show up and at some point things did begin to turn around and I wish I could say that there was one switch that I was able to flip to change everything but I was just doing all I could do and it was showing up to trust and obey God even when he felt far and Silent to trust that the Bible is a spoken word and that he speaks through it to trust that he loves me and he sees me even if I can't find a reason to why he would and to trust that he hears every prayer and holds the tears of every cry I just showed up and I was talking to someone somewhere of 22 explaining how tough of a year it's been and I remember I told them like dude this was probably like the worst year of my life and he told me well why don't you wait because if you wait and you see who you become from this year you might end up saying it was your best year of your life and I know what you're thinking you're like bro why you got why you have all these people telling fortune cookie advice it's just like all this generic stuff right but standing here now I can't say that he was absolutely right absolutely right I didn't see it at the time but God was helping me navigate through her God was helping out helping me navigate through unhealthy views of myself and he was even helping me navigate unhealthy views I had of him God was resourcing me with tools like therapy and surrounding me with people whose presence in my life would go a long way God even gave me also bro my dog he's the best I love also and I'm healthier and stronger today because of it but most importantly because of last year I know that I know that I know that God is exactly who he says he is and I don't always have to feel or see him in the moment to know that he is true to his word that whatever or whoever intended or intends to harm me I know that God intended and will intend it all for good when I look back on my last year though he felt silent at the moment I can see that his Footprints were all over 2022. in my discouragement and hopelessness in my desperate cries he was there present providing and keeping his promises and the thing that I learned about Footprints is that Footprints aren't supposed to be the mark of where you're going right Footprints are supposed to be the mark of where you came from and so you're not always going to see God's footprint in your life in the moment but if you can just get through the hard seasons of when you're not feeling him or seeing him and you're able to look back you will only see one set of footprints but it's because it was not you that was walking this out it was God I was walking you through it all [Music] present providing keeping his promises why don't we all stand today I want to make sure we understand that God he does want to speak to you in a mighty and miraculous way like he wants to show up evidently in your life he wants to show off in your life like he wants to do those things we've seen it throughout scripture we've seen it in your testimonies what I'm trying to leave you with is that yeah sometimes God is loud and there's no way to miss him but sometimes he's silent and it's really hard to see what he's up to but no matter what he is never still God is always at work even in the toughest Trials of Our Lives building us up as he works out his plan for us you know when I think of the the story of Jesus I just imagined the weight of Silence he must have felt as he was on the cross struggling to take his next breath asking the father my God my God why have you abandoned me I imagine the weight of the silence his disciples felt as Jesus took his last breath and they heard that he died as they scattered away the silence and fear they felt wondering if Jesus actually was who he says he was wondering if he really was God the Messiah I'm sure it was hard to feel God but what we now know is that out of that silence came salvation for you and for me today and on that third day God rose up from the grave proving he was exactly who he came here and said he was and if God brought salvation for the whole world if he brought Joseph to an unimaginable place out of Silence what could God be Brewing up out of the silence you're experiencing in your life so as we sit through this question if God feels silent to you today my encouragement is that you won't let it be a signal for you to throw the towel and give up but you would let it be a signal for you to press in to keep showing up in your prayers in your reading and your worship and your daily walk show up believing that the God who feels silent to you right now is actively working things out for your good so as we get ready to sing this last song the authors hears are are open for you to receive prayer if you need it and to spend time with God today thank you", "[Music] today we are in a uh continuing our messy series that's the name of the series not how it's going all right that's the name the messy messy relationship series and so far we've learned a couple of basic things first off god is the restorer of life and relationships the second week god is the primary voice we should be listening to we're not supposed to listen to the serpent in the garden we got that okay are people who offer you apples to eat and today we learn a new standard come uh and so we're gonna we're gonna jump in this we're thinking about this in the context of relationships and there's all kinds of relationships you have john chapter 10 verse 10 i came that they may have have and enjoy life and have it in abundance to the full till it overflows somebody say overflows so this is jesus talking and he's saying he wants you and i to have an abundant life and a life that overflows with good stuff is the implication there all right not bad stuff a lot of us have we're overflowing with bad stuff now we've got to shift that get rid of the bad stuff so we can overflow with the abundance that god has for us one of the steps to that abundant life comes from something that jesus said earlier matthew chapter four this is actually the first sermon that jesus ever publicly preached it's also one of the shortest sermons in history it was change your life god's kingdom is here mic drop that was it change your life god's kingdom is here or another version says it turn from your sins god's kingdom is here repent turn around go a different way don't just keep doing the same old thing getting bad results and bad life out of it there are patterns of success and patterns of failure that successful people leave behind it's like trails that they leave behind or patterns that we can follow if we choose a lot of us are really intent on going and graduating from the school of hard knocks we've got to learn everything our way we've got to learn everything the hard way we have to learn everything in life by the mistakes that we made that is not something to be proud of it is much wiser to learn from the mistakes and successes that other people have made so that we don't have to make those same mistakes and go through the same pain um so let's keep that in mind as well as you're thinking in terms of relationships does it not seem like virtually every relationship follows the same destructive pattern when you look around it's problematic so if we want a better relationship if we want better abundance how do you move from just taking that idea and making it happen there is a difference that many people have in their lives and the primary difference as i see it is the difference in their standards it starts with their standard what they expect of life what they expect of their faith what they expect to do and be today we're going to talk about how to raise your standards we must figure out how to turn our shoulds into our musts must i should have regular time with god to i must have regular time with god i should get in shape we can skip this one should we i should deal with my pain or i must deal with my pain i should improve my communication or i must improve my communication i should get out of debt i must get out of debt i should have a life-giving relationship too i must have a life-giving relationship these are very different standards our shoulds oftentimes in life get shoved into a corner while our musts have to happen there's no option so getting those things to the front of our life so that they are must happens sometimes we get stuck focusing on the process and not the outcome but people to succeed and focus on the outcome before the process this is how it works you see the goal i want this type of relationship in my life you make a plan and then you work the plan you can't start working a plan before you know where you're going so you need to know where you're going first think about it in terms of exercise i just decided to preach an entire sermon for myself today so i'm just preaching this to myself so uh when you think about exercise we have these five rationalizations for not doing it or for not changing things like i don't have time i don't got time for exercise i will do it tomorrow i have done so much exercise tomorrow it might not work it's too hard it takes too much time it's too long too long to change a lot of people a lot of us we don't really lie to ourselves we soften the truth i'm not that out of shape it's not as bad as the other guy situation i didn't eat that much more than i should it hasn't been that long since i exercised pre-covered i didn't overspend that much money and you could go on you could go on but i think there's some real reason some real obstacles to why we don't change we know we want to change we know we want to get better we know we want to have an abundant life we know we want to have that relationship with our spouse we know we want to have that relationship with our kids we know we want to have this situation or that situation we know that it lines up with what god's perfect plan is for us and yet we don't change why why don't we actually change when we want to change so here's some reasons why first off is simply out of practice and when you get out of practice with something you stop knowing how to do it you you kind of forget how to change you you don't know how to change you have no path anymore to change the path overgrows you haven't been on the path so long you lose track of it you're out of practice second is you rationalize it's not that bad i'll do it later third you have ineffective strategies try to change and you fail and then try to change in another way that's also destined to fail it's just an ineffective strategy it won't work but you intent your intent on making an unworkable strategy work it's a proven path of failure this is what it's like being a pastor by the way giving counsel to people you're like if you take this path it will destroy your life but it's your choice it's a proven path of failure and if you take that path it will fail but then there's another category here in this ineffective strategies which is very real and i think we need to be honest about this there's a reality that in the area of relationships in our country relationships have been so problematic for so long for so many people for so many different reasons that people actually have no idea what to do because nobody has ever shown them how to change or how to have the thing that they're looking for because you haven't seen it you don't know how to be it you don't even know how to dream of it and that's a very real situation as well then there's the blender this is one of the reasons that people don't change here's the blender right up here the blender is this you have pain in your life you're you're stuck imagine this is your life the blender is your life you're inside the blender and it goes on and there's all god creates all kinds of pain i'm not gonna have anybody volunteer to put their hand in there or anything it's not we're not gonna go that far but the blender starts there's all kinds of pain and you have pain in your life and it's just chewing you up you have too many bills you you uh you are too far in debt you can no longer fit into the seat on the airplane you haven't had a decent conversation with your spouse in five years and it hurts and the pain is so loud like you start to take notice because it's really annoying to have in your life [Music] i'll only hit it a few more times the um [Music] it just the pain it catches your attention and you're like oh i gotta do something about this pain it's horrible and then you decide to take action you have one good conversation with your spouse for a month you don't use your credit cards for a week you go walking so you take some action and then you start to see some results because of this conversation you you actually felt a little bit more love you you paid down a little bit of debt you fit into your pants without them just stretching out for you and the pain decreases a little bit and you see the light at the end of the tunnel and since the pain now is no longer throbbing the pressure is off and so we stop taking action entirely forgetting the fact that you're still in the blender and because you're still in the blender the blender starts again and it cycles and the pain comes back and this is the temptation in this moment the temptation is just to give up because you're like i already tried i already did a couple of things and it started to work and everything was fine and then boom i'm back to right where i was not realizing that the only way to stop the pain for good is to change for good is to get out of the blender so that your life is not in here that your life is somewhere else today my goal is to help set us up for success in how to change so that the splendor thing is not the way to do it here's five catalysts for change then we'll be done i said that like i'm almost done but i'm not actually almost done i still got five first get disturbed get disturbed meaning get honest with yourself we have a phrase that we use when we are frustrated in english we say i can't stand it any longer usually that means i'm gonna do something about it or i'm so disturbed i must see something else take place okay be being honest with yourself so don't compare don't rationalize don't soften it call it out like it is on yourself if you're one of those people that's just like you've self-described yourself as just i'm just brutally honest be brutally honest with yourself don't try to minimize that pain don't try to hide the pain instead use the pain to motivate you to change because if you kill the pain without change you make the problem worse let's let's pay attention to this one if you kill the pain without change you make the problem worse this is usually done by acting out or self medicating you feel a lot of pain and so you start to cut or one night stands or self-medicating with food or alcohol or drugs for all of you out there that love to smoke weed or drink alcohol a lot the vast majority of you are self-medicating because you are trying to kill the pain listen covering the pain does not mean healing the pain whenever you cover the pain you guys must really hate my voice right now look at that yeah whenever you cover the pain it actually makes it worse it makes the underlying problems worse not better the only path through is through the pain higher level living requires us to get uncomfortable to get disturbed about the lack of an abundant life that jesus has already promised but if we're not living it we should be disturbed by that about an unaddressed pain about relationships that are subpar the world out there will invite you to get involved with all types of bad patterns and unhealthy strategies all kinds of them but romans chapter 12 says don't copy the behavior and customs of the world but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way that you think then you will know what god wants you to do and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect his will really is the world will tell you to do one thing god has a different plan so get disturbed second make a real decision james chapter one here's the brother of jesus talking i love his directness he says but when he asked he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind that man should not think he will receive anything from the lord he is double-minded man unstable in all he does the beginning there in verse six he says he must believe and not doubt he has something very clear in his mind in his understanding he has made a decision in his core all the way to his belief you see that's where it starts the change starts with your belief so i want you to think about the results that you are after a healthy marriage stronger communication with a child better relationship with your parents anything in the relationship realm what do you want what do you think god wants for that then make a real decision bring it all the way to the place of belief know your purpose reasons come first and answers come second there are always going to be obstacles in your way always if you're going around thinking well i want to take the path that has the least obstacles you are never going to get to where you need to go there will always be obstacles there will always be hindrances there will always be pitfalls the path that without those things simply does not exist but obstacles can be overcome so you don't worry about the obstacles when you're dreaming of the abundant life you start with the abundant life you want you start with the belief in the relationship that you are looking for and then you begin to deal with the obstacles you see you can deal with the obstacles in your way but you cannot overcome a lack of vision and if you do not have a vision for your life for your relationships for your purpose you simply will not get it people that say i will never do anything with my life what do you want to do i don't know sit down and talk with them [Music] what are three things that you want to do what's one thing you want to do it's like it's impossible to dream now listen you don't have to know your final ultimate purpose but you do need to have a sense of what your next step needs to be you do need to have a sense of at least the general direction maybe your next relationship goal shouldn't be to have the greatest relationship in the history of all humanity it's fine if that's your goal but you don't have to start that big maybe it could be to figure out how to go on a date with your spouse once a week or once a quarter if that's improvement whatever's improvement or to call your kids once a week or to reach out to your parents and not ask for anything or reconnect with an old friend that was good for you whatever it is you just start you start with a base a foundation you just you you get some first wins and you build from there so it is essential that you begin to build on the proper base a solid foundation a solid rock the first ones are so important matthew 7 jesus again says this anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise like a person who builds a house on a solid rock though the rain comes in torrents and the flood waters rise and the winds beat against that house it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock but anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish like a person who builds a house on a sand when the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house it will collapse with a mighty crash any relationship that is built on the things of this world will wither away the straw the hay and the rubble of life are ultimately destined to fail you but the life and relationships that are built on the word of god will excel in the storm-ravaged world because that's where we live friends we live in a storm-ravaged world not past tense but present the storm is always raging you need to know your action plan what specific actions must i take to make this happen start with the end in mind and then you make dozens of micro steps and micro goals to get there and you're allowed to do this you're allowed to dream this for your life listen if god has plans for you then you should follow his lead jeremiah 29 11 god says i know the plans i have for you says the lord they are plans for good some might say good that's true god has plans for good for you not just for the person next to you for you not for disaster to give you a future into hope and so for those of you that forgot that god has a good future for you and a good hope for you this is your reminder and if god has good plans for you listen to this this is not a big jump it is fair to say that you can have good plans for you if god has good plans for you then you need to have good plans for you just line them up with god's good plans and you're going to be just fine you are allowed to have good plans we started off with an abundant life god wants abundance for you absolutely are you living in abundance if you are that's great if you're not you're allowed to so as you're thinking about this a little exercise you can do at home or if you're bored with the rest of the sermon i want you to find out what your wig is perhaps you've heard this before wig means wildly important goal but in this area i actually think it sometimes equally is helpful to say wildly important gap what's the biggest gap in your life what's the when it comes to relationships what's your wildly important gap the thing that if you could fix that gap it really helps what are you unhappy with what do you want and why do you want it and now make it specific no general stuff no like world peace stuff that's great love world peace and we need to be praying for it a lot right now but when it comes to your relationships be super specific the third catalyst is this create a giant action plan here's a little example of one of god's plans it's action plans so god's plan is to come and set captives free and destroy the works of satan that's his big goal okay that's the big goal and so jesus shows up and uh he's crucified he rises from the dead uh he's now putting his people on mission to go accomplish his purposes so the people that are going to follow jesus are now on the mission of jesus to destroy the works of satan and set captives free in acts chapter 1 verse 8 we're instructed but when the holy spirit has come upon you you will receive power and you will tell people about me everywhere in jerusalem then judea then samaria and to the ends of the earth this is actually a strategy you start here then you go here then you go here and then you go everywhere it's a plan it's a big action plan it's the most significant action plan in history for your situation write down anything you could do to achieve that outcome that you're looking for in your life with relationships then highlight the ones that you think you should take immediately both the little ones and the big ones remember this psalm 127 says unless the lord builds a house the worker the work of the builders is wasted unless the lord protects the city guarding it with centuries will do no good now if you read it one way you might think well it's all up to god but that's not what's going on here it doesn't mean don't plan it means plan with god just plan with god now let's say you're going through all this work you're doing this you're like okay i'm going after this i'm going to go to the next level in my life i'm going to go to the next level in my relationships something awesome is going to happen you're going to experience opposition from three areas you're going to get opposition coming and you're going to have an external opponent external opponents are going to come out when you are trying to go to the next step external opponents will come after you in ways that are difficult to even explain they won't always intend to do it but your friends your acquaintances can be inadvertently trying to hold you back from making progress because they don't understand what's going on they're not living in your space and so it may not be intentional but it can happen it can also happen with intimate opponents perhaps family that are having their own struggles they don't understand what's going on with you or why you're trying to to go this way they may not see it the same way and so they may not be doing it on purpose but it can certainly happen but then you have a huge opponent internally yourself a lot of us can figure out how to overcome the friend and the family but the internal ones difficult when you become your own opponent to living an abundant life these are really going to happen it'll surface all of your your insecurities and this is why it's so important you're not doing this alone you're not doing this with your own willpower you're doing this with god and you are doing this with people that are on your team the fourth catalyst for changing and raising your standard is to change your false beliefs a belief is a feeling of absolute certainty about what something means hebrews chapter 11 says faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see certain like i'm absolutely positive of something i don't see that's a belief and so it's important that we have proper beliefs even about our relationships watch this people say this relationship is beyond repair but god says no relationship is beyond my ability to repair restore and redeem you have to decide which one you believe because those aren't the same things regarding somebody's health people will say it's hopeless but god says there's always hope two different things you have to decide what you're going to believe your finances people might say that you could i can never prosper but god says not only can you prosper but i have plans for you on how to do so already in place or your emotions people say my emotions are so broken and hardened i can never love but god says come to me all who are brokenhearted and i will gently restore you back to health those are belief things if you believe one you go one direction if you believe the other you go in another direction that's about belief what you believe matters even what you believe about yourself the world system and the satanic ruler of this world will try to get you to believe all kinds of things about yourself that are inconsistent with what the scripture teaches the world system will try to get you to believe things about yourself emotionally spiritually sexually relationally academically essentially the enemy will try to get you to misidentify yourself so that he can take you in a wrong direction or a different direction other than what god has for you also what you believe about god if you believe that god hates you and wants to squash you because you are a miserable human being if that's what you believe about god if you believe versus if you believe that god loves you and authentically is working and fighting on your behalf if you believe that god's love is restrictive versus if you believe that god's love sets captives free belief matters as the worship team comes up choose a peer group with a high standard i know you're not in high school but this is still important some of you are in high school but i i know that a lot of you are adults here today it still matters for adults choose a peer group with a high standard first corinthians 15 don't be fooled by those who say such things for bad company corrupts good character come to your senses and stop sinning for to your shame i say that some of you don't even know god bad company corrupts good character and if you ever want to see major change in life make sure to get around people that have already accomplished what you would like to someday accomplish [Music] now if you immediately went to i want to be an nba superstar that's fine that's fine but we're talking about relationships here [Music] when my wife and i decided to start this church or hopefully it was god decided for us to start this church we went to several the most significant churches in america not because we're trying to be buddies but because we wanted to hold ourselves to a higher standard but what could a church in north of boston in the city looked like that was life-giving and transformative the bible teaches this principle universal principles teach it nature teaches every successful life coach teaches it if you want to see positive life change then you must choose a peer group that holds you to a higher standard than where you currently are if you want a healthy marriage find a couple with a healthy marriage invite them over for dinner [Music] if you want to improve your financial literacy get around some financially illiterate people whatever the issue is get around those that can assist you [Music] but don't forget this critical and absolutely fundamental point [Music] the ultimate life change the ultimate life change [Music] the one who ultimately can give life the old the one who can ultimately set our relationships in the right direction the one who ultimately can point us to the future of abundance that is promised is today and always will be jesus christ [Music] so wherever you're at today and your belief your faith your exploration start with jesus and you will be well on your way would you stand with me as we close today i heard those two claps i'll take it i'll take it [Music] friends stay out of the blender get yourself out of the blender commit to patterns of life change not just stopping the pain but getting so far removed from the blender that you don't ever go back in commit to getting the most out of life as christ has told us that he wants don't ever forget his words that you may have and enjoy life have it in its abundance to the full till it overflows that's the life that god has planned for you so worship team closes us with this song let's spend some time in prayer the altars are open if you'd like to commit something to god today please do so if you would like to start a relationship with jesus today you never have this is a great time to do it just call out to him in your own words invite him today invite him to forgive you of your sins to lead your life to take control of who you are so that you might follow him well let's spend some time in prayer today [Music] if you're new to east coast international church we're hosting a lunch just for you on us it's next sunday march

pm on sunday march 20th lead meeting is an intentional time for us to gather together as a team and learn about what's been going on in church since we last met this meeting will be held upstairs in the kids church space and child care will be available for ages 0 to 5th grade", "[Applause] all right good morning everyone look at that I speak Jesus song that we sang today I've actually known that song for a while now and I can't ever sing it all the way through I get too choked up and uh part of the reason is because that's what I try to do every single Sunday is does this speak Jesus over you and so uh it's very very uh important song today every year there is this giant celebration called the Feast of Tabernacles or the Festival of Lights some people even think this is when Jesus was actually born for seven days each year the Jews would celebrate the Feast of the Tabernacles it reminded them that for 40 years they had wandered around in the in the wilderness before God brought them into the Promised Land and how God was with them in their wanderings in the wilderness in the pillar of cloud in the day which turned into fire at night so it's just a big celebration a reminder of what took place and how God provided in Numbers chapter 9 verse 15 it says on the day the Tabernacle was set up the cloud covered it but from evening until morning the cloud over the Tabernacle looked like a pillar of Fire that would have been an interesting sight to see it was very different from a lot of the other annual feasts this uh the first thing that was really significantly different was that for seven days get this for seven days the entire nation would intentionally choose not to live in their house but to camp out instead families moved Outdoors into temporary shelters made of branches and leaves to remind themselves of the hardships that their ancestors had undergone while living in tents during the 40 years in the wilderness the second unique thing that I want you to really pay close attention to today is that on the opening night of the celebration there were a couple of giant menorahs or candelabras that were erected each of these candelabras candle holders was about 75 feet tall with huge bowls on top each Bowl held 10 gallons of oil and then with great Pomp and ceremony the bowls were lit and everyone could see at the end of The Feast the lights at the end of these seven days the lights were purposely put out or turned off the lights were put out why did they turn them out turn them off every year because the Messiah The Rescuer their King of Kings had not yet come they were waiting for the Messiah he hadn't come so was on to another year of waiting now imagine the scene you're in the city of Jerusalem this walled City there's a giant Festival it had just finished the lights had just been extinguished another year had passed and it appears that there is no Messiah for several days at this exact moment in time people had been attentively listening to Jesus throughout the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days and the people were starting to wonder is Jesus the one we're celebrating is Jesus the Messiah John 7 26 said they even asked could our leaders possibly believe that he is the messiah that's what's going on it's the tension of the moment it was in that context and at that moment after the lights had been put out that the next day Jesus was out in public teaching in the temple area John chapter 8 you catch up the story catch up with the story as Jesus was speaking the teachers of the religious law and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery they put her in front of the crowd teacher they said to Jesus this woman was caught in the act of adultery the law of Moses says to Stone her what do you say they were trying to trap him into saying something that they could use against him but Jesus instead stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger they kept demanding an answer so he stood up again and said all right but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone then he stooped down again and rode in the dust what did he write we don't know maybe it was a list of the sins of the sins that the men that were making these accusations had hadn't been involved in that would be clever I think when the accusers heard this they slipped away one by one beginning with the oldest probably because they were the wisest they began to slip away only until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman where are your accusers didn't even one of them condemn you no Lord she said and Jesus said neither do I go [Music] now leads us up to verse 12. pay close attention Jesus imagine not Jesus spinning and turning towards the crowd Jesus spoke to the people once more and said I am the light of the world if you follow me you won't have to walk in darkness because you will have the light that leads to life all in the context of them just having put out the light he's saying I'm light somebody say I am the light now look at your neighbor say I am the light now just to be clear you're not Delight Jesus is the light but but you understand okay it's not an accident it's not an accident that Jesus refers to himself as the light of the world he does it on purpose he is the pillar of fire that led the people through the desert that was Jesus he is the fundamental reason that the festival has just been celebrated and happening they were celebrating him even though they didn't know it he Jesus is the light of the world Jesus is the light in the past he was the light in the present and he will be the light in the future and for many listening to Jesus that day it would have been the last time this is really really powerful this would be the last time that for many in the crowd that day that they would ever have to put out the fire of that Menorah again because the Messiah had finally arrived for them their savior had finally come and somebody here today in this room maybe you've been waiting for something else in your life you've been looking you've been searching you've been hoping and everything that you search for ends up not quite being right you've essentially been putting out the fire year after year because the answer still hasn't been found today I would invite you to consider perhaps Jesus is the answer perhaps you can finally stop searching because he's the one you've actually been searching for all of these years and maybe you won't ever have to put the light out again why is Jesus saying I am the light well think about what light does what does light do when you're confused light has a way of illuminating your path like a headlight when you are lost light has a way of being your beacon like a lighthouse when you are in a dark and stormy sea you can see the light once while on a maneuver a battleship looked uh uh look at a battleship Lookout noted a light in the dark off in the distance it was on a foggy night they were having a hard time seeing and after noting the lights coordinates the captain recognized that the ship was on a collision course with the other vessel the captain instructed signal the ship we are on a collision course advise you change course 20 degrees the return signal countered advisable for you to change your course 20 degrees the captain signaled I'm a captain change your course 20 degrees the response was I'm a seaman second class you better change your course 20 degrees by this time the captain was Furious his signal defiantly uh ordered I'm a battleship change of course 20 degrees the reply came I'm a lighthouse you make the call why because lighthouses don't move lighthouses don't move and I want you to catch this today Jesus is the light of the world he's your Lighthouse your Beacon of Hope if you will let him be and he doesn't move he remains the light of the world no matter how much the world changes Jesus remains steady Jesus remained stable Jesus remains brightly shining for the whole world to know where to go because the world is really messed up and the world is changing so fast it's hard to even know when you wake up how much the world has changed overnight it seems like it changes every 15 minutes but Jesus is steady he's our bright hope our he is right there we simply have to see and take his light another thing light does is light exposes the problem when you are wounded for example the light will help you see the problem so that you can be healed the light has a way of exposing blind spots in our life and I want you to catch us today when God reveals things to us well Jesus points out these blind spots he's not doing it to embarrass you he's not doing it to shame you he's doing it to bring healing to the broken parts of your life so that it might be addressed now I'm at a stage in my life a very interesting stage it's called middle age and what this means is that you need reading glasses to see anything up close and personal even even my notes are in 20 font which is huge right so I used to I started off years ago with 10 font I can't even see what's on this page at all so I like to fit Fix watches as a bit of a hobby and I I put on my glasses and I then I grab a magnifying glass also and I still can't quite see and so what I have to do is I have to put on a headlamp and turn the light on really really bright and then I can see because the light reveals the problem in the little in the little spaces the light of Jesus has a way of revealing the problems in our life for the purpose of healing not for the purpose of condemnation or shame so that we can be made whole that the broken parts of our life can be healed Jesus said I'm the light of the world somebody say of the world of the world I'm the light of the world the whole world not just the Jews not just the region but the whole world the whole wide world what does that mean for us today it means for us today that no matter who you are or where you are from Jesus is for you no matter what you've done or how far you've roamed Jesus is for you no matter if you've been an adulterous woman or a pompous religious hypocrite Jesus is the light of the whole world and he's for you I am your light Jesus says this world that everybody has so many problems with huh Jesus desperately loves and came to rescue this broken mess that we have made think about this today the people that you think of as your enemy Jesus is their light the people that really make you angry and frustrated that you don't want to go visit at Christmas but you're going to anyhow Jesus is as much their light as he is yours he is the light and he will shine brightly to all who will follow me Jesus said I am the light of the world if you follow me you won't have to walk in darkness you won't have to walk in darkness there is something understated here but it's a given that you will walk in darkness because the world is dark you see we are born with a problem we're born with a problem we're born into spiritual Darkness you know there's a there's a hard reality that we are born already ruined that we are born with Wicked hearts that that quickly steer off in the wrong direction we want to think everybody's just nice and and fun but the truth is you I mean a three-month year old and you know we're born with Wicked hearts just try to take that pacifier away and you'll know what I'm talking about the uh we are born into spiritual darkness in need of rescue we're in need of light the whole world is in spiritual Darkness because the prince of this age the illegitimate ruler of this world Satan has blinded people and the light of the world declares Jesus declares we no longer have to walk in darkness if we will follow Jesus if we follow Jesus we won't walk in darkness anymore because he is the light that calls all the way back to the psalmist in 119 when he said your word is a lamp to guide my feet in a light for my path Jesus is that light and he's making it clear I'm the light of the psalmist the light of the fire in the desert the light of the lamp stand that you just put out to us today we might even say that light that you could see at the end of the tunnel but it could never quite get to it turns out that's Jesus and Jesus is the light and it turns out he's here right now it's a powerful analogy like because we've all had experiences with Darkness we've all had experiences with darkness and we're like oh I wish I had some light light and darkness we all understand but when we don't have light we just kind of stumble around trying to find our way and it's dark when my daughter Kyla was born my wife Jen wasn't able to walk for quite a while afterwards but Jen kept trying to walk and her legs would just stop working all of a sudden and she would fall down and so for the first month or so Jen couldn't hold Kyla while she was walking one night Jen got up and she was out in the other room and she fell down and she cried out for help now it's the middle of the night it is pitch dark and I just hear my wife yelling for help or asking for help in the other room and I woke up out of a dead sleep and immediately went into like superhero rescue mode okay it's like this and I imagine the worst possible scenario somehow Jen had gotten Kyla and and they'd fall down and they were hurt and they were in desperate need or they would die kind of you know that's what's going on in my mind right so I I I I in this mode it turns out that Jen had just gone to get some water or something and needed help uh getting back after her legs had stopped working I jumped up from my sleep in the pitch dark for some strange reason when I jumped up I didn't jump up and stand on the floor I jumped up and stood straight up on top of the bed so here I am on top of the bed not on the floor on top of the bed it's dark it's dark remember I'm like adrenaline pumped all the way and it's like a cartoon you know you know like sheets flying out from under my feet I'm so I'm going into full scale Sprint now pitch dark heading towards the door I launch off the bed going to rescue my family I launch off the bed only to find out that the door was not closed the door was not really open it was half open and I jump off the bed full speed slammed my forehead into the little narrow part of the door boom knock myself right out totally knocked out on the floor like trying to rescue my family passed out now here we are my mother-in-law is in the other room unless you've come down to help she wakes up to all this commotion Jen is on the floor in the kitchen I'm in the room passed out she doesn't know what's going on and Kyla is in her room sleeping just fine nothing's wrong with Kyla I'm sure that my mother-in-law must have thought huh how how are these kids going to take care of this baby [Laughter] and she's not knowing who to help you know who's in worse shape right the whole point of that little trip down memory lane is this the head the light spin on I would have made much better choices in that moment had the light spin on because when the lights are on you have an opportunity to see what's really there you see the truth and that's what Jesus is he's a light to help you see what's really going on what's really happening and the truth the truth will set you free now if you've noticed in the news over the past several years the nation of Haiti has experienced one disaster after another they've had earthquakes and hurricanes and Warlords and political outrageous political chaos and this has resulted in a situation where the people are in real trouble or the power grid is either not on not working or severely restricted or compromised creating even more dangerous situation because when you don't have your power grid you don't have light and that's a problem in a modern world literally there are giant numbers of people in Haiti with no electricity no lights no access to anything that can help them to get it and today as we are reminded that Jesus is the light of the world I think it would be a clever and fun Christmas project for us to not just bring the spiritual light to the world but also bring some physical light to the world as an example because now we all know what happens when you wake up in the dark and go running off your bed and we don't want that to happen to anybody else next week we're going to give you all an opportunity to help bring light to the individuals in the community of Haiti what we're going to be doing is this we're going to be buying some special rechargeable magnetic lights that are designed to be stationary and portable like this along with some battery packs that are solar powered like this this is actually much fancier than it looks okay but it's a it's a it's a rechargeable solar battery pack where they can actually uh charge the devices like this or cell phones or whatever would be needed for other devices the cost is about 35 dollars a piece and our on-ground organization needs about a hundred of these now clearly some lights won't solve all the problems of Haiti but to the families that have been without light for months or access to it to again to again have it after a very long time will make a huge difference so next week I'm asking you to buy a hundred lights you can bring some so we can bring some literal physical light and a glimmer of hope to some folks that are in very desperate moment right now the cost is about 35 dollars a piece is thirty five dollars a piece and if you would like to give more than 35 that's fine as soon as we cross 3 500 we'll put the rest towards other humanitarian efforts and in the church Center app it'll be tagged light for Haiti it's in there already this might be a fun project for you and your kids to do for Christmas as well this says I am the light of the world if you follow me you won't have to walk in darkness because you will have the light that leads to light to life it leads to life away from death towards life notice it says that leads to life somebody said leads who's doing the leading Jesus is doing the leading not you not me Jesus is doing the leading the light does the leading we don't lead the light that's the fundamental problem with our response to God is we want to still be the one leading the light we still want to be God God is saying you follow me it will lead to life like the pillar of fire in the desert that led to people in the wilderness we must follow there are some people out there that specialize in like sermonizing and messaging with guilt and shame and condemnation it's like they don't understand Jesus at all and what's really going on you see the light of Jesus doesn't Overlook the wrongs and Sins Of Our Lives but it does always offer us hope to walk in the light to walk towards life and not to live in condemnation or shame or fear it's very easy to point out the bad things going on all around us it's very easy to point out the wrongs in someone else's life it's very easy to point out the wrongs and this thing or that thing the people that have a way of pointing out the wrongs without providing any hope or Solutions are fundamentally flawed because True Light doesn't just point out Darkness it provides escape from that Darkness you see as the worship team comes up Jesus is the Great revealer and Jesus is also our great revelation Jesus Is Our Hope out of despair he is the path out of Destruction Jesus didn't come to condemn the Lost he makes that quite clear instead he came alongside the lost as a spiritual flashlight and said let me help you find the way Jesus never ignored the adulterous woman's sins instead he offered her the hope and the light of the world and that light and hope was him in that same light and that same hope is available for you and me today his name is Jesus would you stand with me as we close friends today as you consider how you're going to respond Let Jesus be your light if there's some broken areas in your life and heart Let Jesus help you find your way if you're not sure which way to go Let Jesus help you find your way today let's spend some time in prayer the altars are open you can spend some time up here if you like let's just respond to Jesus today [Music]", "all right [Applause] so

okay this Thursday we have an exciting thing as well we have something called dinner church that we are launching dinner church is at the Revere location every Thursday at 6 00 pm this is an alternative way to have church it's not like you go to regular Church which this is uh some some would call it irregular church I know but this is regular church and that will be an alternative a version of church on Thursdays that uh will be happening over over tables at a meal together and just a very different way to do church but we are opening that after a long summer of doing our cohort so this Thursday 6 p.m at the dinner at Revere location now we are wrapping up our Exodus Series today that we have been in for a few years I believe two and a half three years that we've been in this series on and off on and off on and off and uh so uh we're wrapping it up today with Exodus chapter 33 verse 3. last week we started with this a story where uh the people had engaged in uh idolatry and Pagan revelry and God was very upset with them uh and this is where we're picking up the story Exodus 33 verse 3. God says go up to this land that flows with milk and honey but I will not travel among you for you are a stubborn and rebellious people if I did I would surely destroy you along the way when the people heard these Stern words they went into mourning and stopped wearing the jewelry and fine clothes well the Lord had told Moses to tell them you are a stubborn and rebellious people if I were to travel with you for even a moment I would destroy you remove your jewelry and find clothes while I decide what to do with you so from that time sorry that so from the time they left Mount Sinai the Israelites wore no more jewelry or fine clothes verse 8 whenever Moses went out to the tent of meeting all the people would get up and stand in the entrances of their own tents they would all watch Moses until he disappeared inside the tenant meeting is a place where Moses would talk to God as he went into the tent the pillar of the cloud would come down and hover at its entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses when the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents inside the tent of meeting the Lord would speak to Moses face to face as one speaks to a friend afterward Moses would return to the camp but the young man who assisted him Joshua remember that name Joshua son of Dunn would remain behind in the tent of meeting in verse 3 God said this thing he said I will not travel among you I will not travel among you although God is honoring his promise to give them the Promised Land God is concerned that if he goes with these people these people those people that he will surely destroy them why because they are stubborn and rebellious and God might lose it with them that's why all right that's what's that's what's going on here that's the the theme even after even after all these obvious and miraculous works of God we have this group of people that are just ridiculously stubborn and rebellious after The Exodus From Slavery they rebelled after the mighty signs they rebelled after the miraculous moments they saw all around them they rebelled After experiencing the grace and mercy and goodness of God they rebelled to me that sounds ridiculous how is it even possible why would they choose to walk and live that way oh never mind we do the exact same thing every single day this is not surprising to me this is just like regular life right here in 2022. you see this is how it works today we walk in the excessive blessing of God for a season and then for some inexplicable reason we stumble off the path God's blessing us and then all of a sudden we turn to our former way of thinking God's blessing us and we resist his Direction and we resist his gentle correction and the next thing you know we are worshiping our own modern versions of golden calves the golden calf of Empire the golden calf of money the golden calf of self worship the golden calf of Independence and self-direction the reality is the story of the Israelites in Exodus in the desert is just a mirror to our lives today it just happened to take place 35 centuries ago the scripture repeats this ongoing theme it says in Jeremiah 17 that the human heart is the most deceitful of all things and desperately wicked our hearts have a way of deceiving us because in our fallen Humanity which is found that fallenness is founded in Rebellion that Rebellion continues to be the very thing that our hearts must fight against we Rebel today because we were born Rebels but not in the good kind of way we were born rebellious one of the anecdotes to rebellion and here it is if you want to beat rebellion in your life you just radically submit to God in his word is radical submission whatever you say God whatever your word says that's what I will do that's radical submission it's not easy sometimes when I'm reading the Bible I'm reading along and I'm thinking to myself what that's crazy those people are going to be in serious trouble or I might think to myself as I'm reading and when I read the Bible it turns into a story in my head okay it's like a movie playing out and I'll read and I'll be like you've got to be kidding me that's insane what kind of person would ever get themselves into that kind of a situation or this is also a common thought I cannot wait to preach this part of the Bible because I know two people that really need to hear this and then now that the Holy Spirit has sufficiently set me up with a few left Jabs all of a sudden the Holy Spirit brings the right uppercut right to the chin of my own selfish and rebellious heart and the word and the spirit begin to point out the golden calves in my own heart and my own life and I am forced to make a decision repent or deny repent or deny and sometimes I repent sometimes I deny because I'm just like Israel and so are you wicked-hearted and rebellious and God was not having it anymore he was finished he was heated they had found his very last nerve and those people God called them those people of Moses's that Moses was leading he was heated with and he was just calling it plain if I go with you I'm gonna just destroy you all because you're also Wicked now the people's the people when they people heard these Stern words they went into mourning and stopped wearing their fine jewelry and clothes this tiny little verse has so much going on in it mourning and a changing of outfits fine clothes and jewelry in the Old Testament you'll see these moments where God speaks out in some type of uh declaration some type of judgment that such and such is going to happen and there are two kinds of responses a good response and a bad response so the bad responses are those people that's like they hear what God says they flip him the bird and they double down with hardened Hearts like the Pharaoh in Egypt the Pharaoh in Egypt had 10 chances to relent and repent yet he saw himself as the true king of kings only to find out that he wasn't even the king of himself and then there are those that are softened by the Declarations of God they realize they have errored and they freely relent and freely repent there are those that authentically mourn their sin and Rebellion have you ever said or heard someone say I wouldn't change anything today because it's made me who I am today sounds so clever it really annoys me when people say that really you wouldn't change anything you wouldn't change your Rebellion you wouldn't change your wickedness you wouldn't change your ignorance you wouldn't change your indiscretions you wouldn't change the hurt that you've caused other people you wouldn't change the golden calf that clearly you continue to bow down of pagan revelry now sometimes people are just misspeaking they heard something and they just repeat it they're just saying it and hopefully what you mean if you've ever said it is I am grateful that in spite of everything that has happened and everything I have done that God has been merciful and showed me Grace and I deeply mourn my rebellion and idolatrous worship and am grateful for every moment of every day that God has not left me but continues to restore me now if that's what you mean when you say it that's great but maybe say that instead so the question to wrestle with today is there a rebellion in your life that you need to be mourning for authentically mourning for sometimes there are things that we have done that are so embarrassing in our life we are so embarrassed by that rebelliousness or that situation that we just want to run from it we want to deny it but the right thing to do is this the healthy thing to do is this own your Rebellion for what it is and mourn your Rebellion don't elevate it mourn it the next thing was they changed their outfits this is an interesting part of the story remember it said said they took off their jewelry and find clothes tell your neighbor jewelry and find clothes doesn't mean they were walking around naked now it means that they had different clothes on okay but for a minute in the Bible where did the jewelry and fine clothes come from these are slaves former enslaved people it hanging out in the desert they just left in a mass Exodus they didn't have any money they didn't have any stuff how to get jewelry in fine clothes I'm so happy you asked you see when God delivered them from slavery he did something very interesting he included radical reparations from the wealth of the Egyptians to be handed over to the Israelites it was like a spiritual Financial requirement on behalf of the Egyptians to pay back the Israelites for 400 years of forced labor it's fascinating Exodus chapter 12. we're going back to when they actually were leaving Egypt and the people of Israel did as Moses instructed they asked the Egyptians for clothing and articles of silver and gold the Lord caused the Egyptians to look favorably on the Israelites and they gave the Israelites whatever they asked for so they stripped the Egyptians of their wealth that's why they have so much stuff is the wealthy Egyptians had this massive transfer from the unbroke people to the broke people and now the broke people are not broke anymore because that's what's going on here's what it appears to be going on God takes this group of unequipped people under resource enslaved people and he's going to give them physical freedom and he's also going to give them Financial Freedom and resources and he's going to establish Israel as a unique nation of people blessed to be a blessing he's going to give them a reason to grow develop and prosper in he's going to go before them and remove the current occupiers of their land and then there will be this ongoing Unity with God and the people that will ultimately reveal the love of God to the entire world that's what God's trying to do that's not what happened though once the people started taking a closer look at the wealth they had just accumulated from Egypt so early on they're just kind of happy to be out right then they start looking for their through their luggage be like oh I forgot about this like 20 million dollars of stuff we have now then they started looking at it all and like started putting it on this looks good on me okay you know so you can imagine this happening in the desert and so they started to do something very unfortunate they started to trust the wealth that God had provided for them instead of the one who did the providing money has always been sneaky like that the wealth the fine clothes and the jewelry which they got from Egypt became a deceiver among them once they pulled out the wealth they started to act like their slave masters used to act that is an unfortunate problem they left the slavery of Egypt and now they are becoming the slaves of Mammon material wealth so in the text when it says they stopped wearing their jewelry and fine clothes this was not some problem with jewelry and fine clothes it wasn't like God is saying to us in 2022 no jewelry everybody some of you been to that church okay I know but that's not what's going on here that's not where this verse is that's not what this verse is talking about it was a corporate and individual acknowledgment of their sin it was an act of repentance and Mourning of what they had just done that's what's going on here remember repentance is the turning away from a previous course of action and they were turning away from what they had just done they took off these old ways and they were taking on this attitude of mourning so ask yourself the question today is there an outfit that I need to change is there some jewelry and fine clothes that I've been hanging out with that are leading me down the wrong path is there an outfit you need to change so so some time goes by so all this is happening the people are Mourning God's deciding what he's going to do it's not a good scene maybe a few weeks go by maybe a few months go by after God makes this declaration people are mourning and repenting and during this time Moses starts to think about what God Said and he starts to have some concerns about what God Said was going to happen you see earlier God had said you're going to go to the promised land and I'm going to send an angel to go before you and it all sounds great they still get the promise but Moses began to get concerned about a traveling Angel as their companion instead of God being with them it's like he realizes I don't want a stinking Angel to lead us I want God to lead us if I have to choose the two I'm choosing God so Moses decides that no mere angel can be a substitute for the presence of God so Moses goes to have a conversation with god in this tent where they get to talk and before we read this section remember the following things remember God has already promised the land is going to be theirs the angel is supposed to go before them and deliver into their hands it's a pretty good deal for some very rebellious people but Moses is not interested in the angel and on some level he doesn't even care about the land he's interested in the presence of God so watch this interaction watch this really clever interaction one day Moses said to the Lord you have been telling me take these people up to the promised land but you haven't told me whom you will send with me you have told me I know you by name I look favorably on you if it is true that you look favorably on me let me know your ways so I understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favor he said and got up as if God didn't know and remember that this nation is your very own people now you may not catch it at first but God had just told Moses a little time ago that these were Moses's people Moses is now reminding God of something he already knows in the text it says you're very own people somebody say you're so so Moses is making sure that he's saying nah not my people your people he's reminding God of something he already knows that the people are not his people they belong to God the Lord replied to Moses I will personally go with you Moses I will give you rest everything will be fine for you that's great news for Moses Moses can be content live out his days with God be all set but it's not good enough Moses wants God's presence for the whole community for all the people then Moses said if you don't personally go with us he's so clever adding us us don't make us leave this place it's like I'm not leaving this place without you God how will anyone know that you look favorably on me on me and on your people if you don't go with us for your presence Among Us sets your people and me apart from all the other people on the Earth now this is Moses insisting that this blessing of God's presence must be for all of them not just for him the Lord replied to Moses I will indeed do what you have asked Moses here is interceding and mediating between God and the people and he would not accept the blessing of the presence of God only for himself it's like I can't leave this place without you God I can't go any further without you so the promised land can wait until this is all taken care of he did not accept the blessing just for himself but contended and I think some of us need to contend for our families I think some of us need to contend for our community we need to contend for the presence of God not just for ourself but for all and because God looked favorably on Moses he showed Mercy to the entire community now once you've experienced the presence of God you begin to see things happen in your life your own life and you begin to realize some things you begin to realize that no matter what's going on in a person's life it's only God that can really bring true healing it's it's only God that can bring real victory it's only God that can bring authentic deliverance and freedom now there's a big picture in the story that can get lost in the verse by verse look the big picture is that God absolutely has been desperately trying to establish his presence amongst the people but sometimes we the people have a way of messing everything up and God awaits our return to him while he also is actively seeking us out to return but we're in a different space today because we're on the other side of Jesus you see today because of Jesus and the giving of the Holy Spirit the presence of God is with us and available to us all the time and when you realize in your life that all you've got is the presence of God it is in that moment that you realize the presence of God is all that you really need you see you don't need the land you need the presence of God and you don't need that fancy job you need the presence of God you don't need the stuff you need the presence you don't need the house you need the presence you don't need this thing or that thing you don't need me you don't need them you simply need the presence of God because it is only the presence of God that can take what's wrong and make it right and it's in the presence of God that he will make it right and if you make time for God he will make time for you because Jesus always has time for you earlier we read that when Moses left the tent with the presence of God it says this and it's so easy to miss this it says Joshua son of none would remain behind in the tent of meeting who who is this Joshua why is he popping up in the story all of a sudden just kind of a random side note the author have ADD he just randomly dropped it in here I don't know what's going on actually it's when these kind of things happen in the Bible it's a good indicator we're going to hear more about Joshua in fact if you don't know this Joshua is Jesus's real name Jesus is Yeshua Yeshua Joshua okay so that's what we're going back to so that's so when he was named he was named after this this guy this is a seemingly unimportant note however there is a hint that we are going to hear about this young man he's a young man the young Joshua and what we know about young Joshua is this he loved to be in the presence of the Lord so much that when it was time to leave the tent when Moses took off Joshua refused to leave because he was going to soak up as much of the presence of God as possible I love this idea he's like yeah you guys going to leave if you want I'm sticking around I still got some presents to soak up you ever you ever been to one of those Marvel movies at the theater you know you know what I'm talking about come with me go ahead come with me you got those you're at the theater you're sitting in the theater the Marvel it's n and people get up and they leave they're rookies they don't know that you're not supposed to leave the Marvel movie until the end of the credits because so these people are leaving and then a few people know that if you stay through the credits there's a little bit more of the movie that's going to happen to let you know when the next movie is coming Joshua stayed until after the credits he stayed until after the credits were done when it came to the presence of God because the presence of God was transforming Joshua it was transforming Joshua and making him a Godly Man it was making him a brave man he was making him a courageous man it was making him a faithful man who would intimately understand the character of God and Joshua would be used by God greatly in the years to come he spent time in the presence of God and God spent time with young Joshua one of my favorite musical groups is a group called common hymnal strange name they are a mixture of praise and protests and they have a song that's called he has time and we're going to in just a moment we're going to close with that song most of you have not heard this song before and I want you to prayerfully listen and respond to it today you'll have some time to reflect on it sometime to engage with it and just to sit and be in the presence of God today the

Coast International Church uh uh thrift store it's called The Loft at Stetson and as you heard more and more about that it's just one of the newest things that we are super proud of and very grateful for all of the many volunteers that are helping uh make that happen so thank you one more time so we're jumping right in in our continuing our let's go series we in Acts chapter 17 today but I want you to imagine this I moved out to New England when I was um 19 years old I uh and I kind of never left all right so I I really feel much like I am a New Englander but in New England one of the things you notice is that you are surrounded by All Things New England Sports Red Sox Celtics Patriots and I can just keep going on we Bruins sorry I left out the Bruins in the first service okay the Bruins uh so and so when I when I was a a kid we didn't have like the professional sports teams uh that like all as many as you have out here where I was from and so this was kind of an interesting thing for me to see and it's a really serious thing out here people aren't pretending about their sports or the sports teams so every Christmas my family has an opportunity we go to Wisconsin to spend time with uh my my grandmother who's still living and and when I go out to Wisconsin I realized that the Green Bay Packers probably actually have the most aggressive fan base in the nation right I just got to explain this to you if you've never been there you may not understand it's as though all of humanity in the state of Wisconsin at wintertime is covered in Packers green and yellow it literally it's like a sea of green and yellow everywhere you go it's all Packers all the time the good times and the bad times which they've had plenty of it's all about the Packers it's kind of like a religious experience for them all and for real it's it's really really intense so makes really a lot of fun to wear Patriots gear in Wisconsin every Christmas okay so some might even call it kind of an idol it's such a big deal now I don't know if we should get into NFL being an idol or not I'll just leave that alone for now right but let's go to another city that was filled with all kinds of Idols a city that was all about a certain thing uh a city that was all it wasn't about sports their their version of sports was uh being intellectually Elite okay so we're going to go to another city today um filled with Idols so today we are traveling over to ancient Greece the city of Athens so I want you to right now to put on your invisible togas keep your current clothes on but put on your invisible togas and come with me where we will continue the story of how the earliest Christians the early church fulfilled the mission of Jesus because that's the whole point of the book of Acts is do the mission of Jesus and this is how you do it right that's the point of acts so here we are Acts chapter 17 we have a guy named Paul who was one of the earliest Christian leaders and Paul was waiting for them in Athens he was deeply troubled by all the idols he saw everywhere in the city now the city of Athens has a major history and significantly captures the culturally and intellectually Elite of the world and Athens remained like that for Centuries with figures like Socrates and Plato and Aristotle and Epicurious epicurus living there it was the cultural and intellectual Center of much of the world think about the places in the world today that are considered the cultural or intellectual or academic centers of the world you know we live in one of them in Greater Boston so in the city of Athens the region of Athens there were these Idols or statues that were built all over the place there were so many gods and goddesses at the time that the Athens had more Idols built than all the rest of Greece combined historians say now here we have Paul one of the early leaders he's committed deep with in him he is committed to fulfilling the mission of Jesus no matter what and he takes the mission of Jesus literally when Jesus said go into all the world so Paul has left Israel he's left Jerusalem and he's now traveling the world he's all the way to Greece at this point into the city of Athens some places that Paul went he was received really well in other places he went he was kicked out of or threatened to kill or they tried to kill him well on one of his journeys he ends up uh stopping in Athens now just imagine Paul is sailing along the coast he's sailing along the coast uh of of Greece he comes across uh Athens where his whole mission the mission of Paul is the mission of Jesus which is to disrupt The Works of Satan wherever you go and he is leaving one area and he's Sailing by the coast of Greece and he can literally look from the boat he can literally look from the sea to the Acropolis when I say the Acropolis this is what I'm talking about on the screen that's not it there's a that's the that's it it looked a lot different back then but this is kind of the the ruins of of the Acropolis or the that's actually the name of the Hill Parthenon is what's what's on top there and so I want to give you some perspectives so here's a picture of my wife and I there in Athens and so in the the back you can see behind us we're several miles away from the Acropolis and just zoom in you can keep going in but on the other side you can see the ocean or the sea the Mediterranean Sea it's back there so Paul from the sea was closer to the Acropolis than we were there in that picture so my point is this here Paul is Sailing by and he can see this giant Temple to false gods Paul has a certain kind of personality this this would not make him happy this would be like Oh I'm going there I need to go do something over there I can just imagine Paul going to the the ship captain and say pull into the port right now because these people need to have a chance to be set free set free from idolatry set free from the worship of false gods set free from heathenism set free from corrupted thinking their eyes have been blinded by the God of this age and they need to be given a chance to have their eyes opened and for freedom to be gained all this through the king of kings and and the resurrected Jesus Christ now that's kind of Paul's attitude and approach it sounds like what I just said could all apply to the United States of America right now so these truths are still in effect so here we have the ship pulling in you can just imagine Paul jumping off the boat walking on the road that literally goes straight to the hill straight to the Parthenon the road all the way though is lined with statues of gods and goddesses and Idols it's perhaps historians have said the most religious place in the world at the time it's interesting that's where Paul goes he decides to go uh to the the the center of the problem literally to the the heart of the problem his first stop when he gets there was to find a synagogue in verse 17 it says he went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles and he spoke daily in the Public Square somebody say Public Square square square Public Square to all who happened to be there so his first stop was the synagogue to make sure he touched Spas with the family make sure he makes sure that they're all on the board that they understand uh the good news of Jesus and gives them their chance his second stop was the Public Square which is called the Agora now in all of these ancient cities uh that in in this part of the world they all had three things at least they all had temples they all had theaters and they all had aoras or public squares now aoras were these large open air community and meeting spaces where businesses took place and social meetings and political meetings all occurred all out in the open open air markets and libraries and celebrations and days of worship imagine today if you try to put yourself there imagine if we took all of our restaurants in in our city and our our city hall and our library and our theaters and our stores and our cafes and imagine if we Face them uh outward into an open space that's what it would be like all in the same spot it was the Agora was a place where everybody would go to see things to be seen to hear and to be heard remember no cell phones no Netflix no Instagram no Snapchat no whatever else there is none of that so there were no other distractions this is literally what everybody wanted to do all the time was to go out and talk about everybody else all right or the new thoughts or the new IDE it's kind of like Facebook right so it was all of that right there out in the open that's what an Agora is by the time Paul arrives Athens is a city of people that perceive themselves to be the academic Elite of the entire planet and it was like that for centuries some call it the birth place of civilization like as in you weren't civilized before and now you are they are thinkers they are dreamers they are knowers they talk they debate they are the philosophical Heirs of Socrates and and Aristotle they are the spiritual children of these gods and goddesses inside of the text that we're reading the author of Acts inserts into his account this little statement in verse 21 it's kind of an interruption into the story he says it should be explained that all the Athenians as well as the foreigners in Athens seem to spend all their time discussing the latest ideas so he's really trying to send home the message of what's Happening Here you see these people love to hear new ideas they love to debate them and they love to do it all out in the open for everybody to hear across the ancient world Athens was known for this and here's where we pick up the story in vers Verse 18 Paul had a debate with some of the epicurian and stoic philosophers when he told them about Jesus and his resurrection they said what's this babbler trying to say with these strange ideas he's picked up others said he seemed to be preaching about some foreign Gods so there's there's it's creating some tension in the market people are hearing and they're being confused they're not quite sure what he's talking about verse 19 then they took him to the High Council of the city come and tell us about this new teaching they said because these people love new teachings I love the new ideas so you are saying some rather strange things and we want to know what it's all about and this all took place at a physical location called Mars Hill which is essentially next door to the Parthenon that we showed you earlier on a little Rocky Hill uh I was there I took some video footage AG of it which we'll show right now uh I should have moved slower but I'm this I'm literally standing in a spot where Paul would have been teaching uh the the council and talking about the council and uh the reason this is important is because he's doing it in the middle of all of this Pagan worship of gods and goddesses right in the heart of it this you couldn't get more in the heart of what's happening and that's straight where Paul went to he began what some would call one of the most important sermons in history verse 22 so Paul standing before the council addresses them as follows men of Athens I notice you are very religious in every way so Paul is trying to play nice he's finding a common ground with his hearers he sought to lead them from where they were to hopefully they might accept the work and person of Jesus as the Ultimate Reality ity of God's Redemptive work for all of humankind but in spite of their religiosity the Athenians were ignorant of the true God and I want you to pay attention to that today because religious never automatically means right you can be very religious and very wrong you could be very religious in any faith including Christian faith and still be wrong so religious does not automatically mean right or true so it's important for us to pay attention to that what so often what happens is what so often begins for people as a search for truth and meaning gets corrupted into foolish nonsense and a search for power or Prestige or something like that Paul continues on as he speaks to the crowd and the councel for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines and one of your altars had this inscription on it to an unknown God so it sounds like they're covering their bases right they got all these God thousands and thousands of gods and goddesses and they got to make one for the unknown God Paul then says this is the god whom you worship without knowing this is the one I'm telling you about so what he's doing here is he's connecting with them on their own terms he recognizes that there is somewhere deep within all of this religious Superstition and nonsense something actually good and here's why this is important it reveals the character of God that God is always at work drawing people to himself even in incorrect places even inside corrupted thinking God uses what the enemy meant or means for evil and appears to leave a trail of Truth crumbs for truth truth Seekers to eventually find their way to Jesus if they will follow that truth hallelujah now Paul continues that this unknown God he says he is the god who made the world and everything in it since he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth he doesn't live in man-made temples now he he just said two really hot things right there okay because they got lots of temples and they believe that the world was created very differently but it was so anyhow so and human hands can't serve his needs for he has no needs he himself gives life and breath to everything he satisfies every need from one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth he decided beforehand when they should rise and fall and he determined their boundaries his purpose was for the Nations to seek after God and perhaps somebody say Perhaps Perhaps and perhaps feel their way toward him him and find him though he is not far from any of us the word perhaps here is inserted in an extremely intriguing way and idea that Paul's sharing go here's what's happening he's laying down the argument and the framework that God is always at War fighting for you he's always fighting on your behalf he's always setting the stage for you to win he's always bringing you to a point of decision but he never makes You Do It ultimately the choice is yours this is where the perhaps language comes in the choice is ultimately ours because God has already made the decision that he will say yes to anyone who freely chooses him anyone I mean anyone that should trouble you on some level because that means that some people will choose Jesus that you were hoping wouldn't like it's okay if they don't make it I'm okay with that you know for real maybe we're not being honest if you think I don't know if you have to tell them Pastor Kurt that's okay yeah we can just leave them out of this one but God has already decided he will say yes to anyone who chooses him Paul continues to communicate that God has been at work through the ages to give people a chance to freely choose him and that they can know this unknown God if they freely choose verse 28 for in him we live and move and exist as some of uh your own poets have said we are his offspring and since this is true we shouldn't think of God as an idol designed by Craftsmen from gold or silver or stone God overlooked people's ignorance about these things in earlier times but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to to him for he has set a day for judging the world with Justice by the man he has appointed and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead so this is he been talking about Jesus now what we have here recorded in Acts is not every single thing word for word that the Apostle Paul said when he was in Athens it simply captures the major themes of his argument and at this point Paul has clearly presented to the listeners Jesus as the Christ God With Us and the hearers that day understood what he said they captured his argument that he was making which is why they responded the way they did in a little bit so let's review this plainly there are four major thoughts four major themes that Paul is talking about and if you get these four themes deep in your soul it will be the greatest Christmas present you could have ever received for real if you if you can get these deep in these four things and each of these four themes are really a punch in the face to the spiritual face of the Athenians because they don't believe any of these things and these four themes are this there is one God there is one race there is one creation and there is one savior Hallelujah one God One race One Creation one savior amen I mean that's about as simple as you can make the Bible right there it's right there one God One race One Creation one savior the Pinnacle of his sermon focuses on the centuries long unfolding of God's Great rescue mission for Humanity and the rescue mission is fulfilled in Jesus Christ now since we are God's Offspring in the biblical sense of being created in the image of God we should not think then in terms of God as gold or silver or stone and all that idolatrous ignorance here we see in the text was overlooked by God in the past because God has always been more interested in Repentance than judgment amen does will God will there be judgment absolutely absolutely there is no doubt but God is more interested in Repentance than he is in judgment hallah so take the time to repent while you can't he will he will set the stage he will give you the opportunity because he always prefers repentance over judgment nevertheless here we have in the person and work of Jesus God has acted in such a manner to make Idol olry bu heinous and so to reject Jesus is to reject the personal intervention of God on behalf of humans and to entirely miss his rescue that's why choosing Jesus is so important so we don't miss his rescue the ultimate evidence of the truth is that God himself has proven it all by raising Jesus from the dead that's that's what Paul's teaching here amen Romans chapter 3 a different part of scripture says God presented Jesus as the sacrific for sin people are made right with God when pause there for a second if you've ever felt like you're not right with God if right now you don't feel like you're right with God like if you just pause and like do I feel like I'm right with God and you feel like the answer that's no listen to what it says people are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life shedding his blood Hallelujah that's how you become right with God you believe that Jesus sacrificed his life shedding his blood that's for you that's for me the sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past so this is an interesting Christian thought both it's an entrylevel Christian understanding thought like if you're going to ever understand anything about uh Christian faith this is the thought you have to get your head around but it's also at the same time one of the deepest and most profound thoughts that would be worthy of our meditation literally for the rest of our life that's how important that thought is it's all summarized in this this message that Paul gave one God One race One Creation one savior Hallelujah there's a lot of implications there but one God One race One Creation one savior as a worship team comes up so once once Paul concludes with his his uh message his defense of his faith to the counsel and to the crowds verse 32 this is how people respond when they heard Paul speak about the resurrection of the Dead some laughed in contempt but others said we want to hear more about this later but some joined him and became Believers so you have three groups here you have the scoffers or the Skeptics or the cynics or the mockers whatever you want to call them that's that's the first group and there's always going to be that group there's always going to be that group whose eyes are just completely blinded and they don't get it yet on then you have this other group of curious people they're spiritually curious they're not uh offended by this they are curious and would like to know more um and sometimes people get stuck in the space they make it an intellectual thing instead of a heart thing and so they they get stuck in the space of curiosity but then there's this other group of convinced people I wish we knew more about what happened following this we really don't know a lot more about what happened in Athens after this just a very little bit but it does say that some were convinced and I would like to believe that those people that were convinced then were able to convince others I have a a friend here in town that very much wants to be a follower of Jesus but but he is not he wants to be but he's not and he texted me one day not too long ago and he asked me to grab a coffee with him now I assumed based on the our text thread that he wanted to talk about something else but that was incorrect we grabbed coffee what he wanted to do is have a pretty significant spiritual conversation and there we were in the cafe talking about uh Jesus and who Jesus really is is and what his response to Jesus would be and he's been contemplating and thinking and just as he is in the middle of this very deep and important spiritual statement that he's saying not me he is one of his friends sees us in the cafe and comes up to him and starts heckling him for meeting with me dead serious isn't it interesting that there will always be people that the enemy is going to use as a distraction always there's always going to be a distraction when you're making a decision whether you're going to follow Jesus or not why don't you stand with [Music] me every time you make a decision that you are going to pursue Jesus you will be loaded up with distractions money distractions people distractions relationship distractions political distractions news distractions I you just keep on going your car breaks down whatever it is everybody has this we all deal it deal with it it's always going to be a distraction you got to choose Jesus anyhow it it's still in your court you got to decide for the Athenians their distractions were big like a liftime a lifetime of worshiping false gods a lifetime of it family and friends that believed a different way systems and structures that were entirely opposed to Jesus lot of distractions in all fairness to them it was a lot of distractions and we can we experience that in our own life it's always going to be a distraction when you're deciding if you're going to choose Jesus choose Jesus anyway choose Jesus anyway no matter what the distraction choose Jesus anyway whether today you are an Athenian intellectual or a Lin Onan factory worker fight through the distractions and choose Jesus anyhow join with Jesus join with his purposes and plans for you choose Jesus and dismiss the distractions so that you can go all in the worship team's going to come up in a moment as they do some of you today may need to choose Jesus maybe you need to choose Jesus again maybe your whole life has just been one big distraction choose Jesus choose Jesus because he is the resurrected Jesus who has overcome death on your behalf to offer you the Forgiveness of sins and to be in right relationship with God once and for all as the worship team leads us our altars are but if you'd like to spend some time in prayer please do", "everyone now it's a little different experience without the uh all the stage lights and stuff so you'll appreciate them when they're back working again next week something happened with the electric or something we're figuring it out the uh it is the first Sunday of the month which means it is the red chair Sunday red chair Sunday right so we're going to be talking so Pastor Emily's up here which means we are talking about our Bible engagement goal so what tell us about what our goal is this month so for the month of May our goal is to read does anybody know it Ephesians Philippians and Colossians yes yes three books good why because they're really good okay why do you want us to read them oh because they're really good we're trying to engage this year with the Bible I think it's important that every single person who is trying to follow Jesus Takes the time to get to know what that means who he is what he said what his teachings are so every month we're digging into a different goal and this month we're hitting these three letters all right so let's focus on uh Ephesians for right now so Ephesians of the three so we're using the word book but it's not really tell us about that it's really a letter written to a specific group of Believers to a church so there's a church in Ephesus Ephesus is the name of a city and um Ephesus is actually in in what country modern day modern day Turkey any of you have not been there and so it's foreign Place uh so it's right on the Sea on the uh GNC but you're more familiar you're familiar with the Mediterranean probably more than that and so it's in that part of the world it's where this city is so there's a church there and Paul oh who wrote the book Paul Paul Paul Paul one of the one of the early Church Christian leaders wrote the book and he's writing uh to this church church there so what do we know about Ephesus the place where he's riding we actually know a lot about Ephesus because it shows up in the book of Acts and it shows up in the Book of Revelation so one of the things that's really cool about Ephesus is it is a place that Paul went on his missionary Journeys and it's where he got arrested yep a lot of stuff happened in fact acts 18 19 and 20 would fill you in on the story in Ephesus a lot it's very very uh it's a great story to read yeah if you're curious so emphasis is a ancient Center of travel of uh Commerce of a tourism all at this Center and so people and it was at the mouth of a river so it's on the on the sea and it's at the mouth of a river and it's one of the great seaports of the ancient world which is a really big deal back then because back then they didn't have airplanes trains trucks Teslas Ubers you don't have any of that okay and had donkeys and camels and and some stuff and people that carry stuff so boats was the fast way to move stuff in and out they also had a few roads three major roads which was also a luxury back then major roads coming in and out of Ephesus scattering all over Asia Minor okay which like modern day turkey and Greece and all of those areas so all that's happening um so we're going to recap who what where when why how those kind of questions okay so who wrote The Letter Paul who was he riding it to the believer so the church in Ephesus the Christians and Ephesus um and it was not a book it was a letter we call it books today which is exceptionally confusing I apologize for church history on that one for you the uh we should really just call it a letter uh and It Was Written we know it was written to the church at Ephesus but the church was made up of who all sorts of people from all different walks of life some previous Jews pagans Gentiles all sorts of people so it was a multi-ethnic multi-socio economic kind of church it was everybody it was literally Jews and Gentiles like Jews that believed that Jesus is the Messiah Gentiles meaning non-jews who just found out about Jesus and and uh the one true God and so they're all coming together they're trying to figure out how to worship together which is Complicated by the way we take people from the whole world put them in one church and say hey figure it out good luck you know it's a little complicated okay that's true and so Paul's writing uh to them they probably had a couple issues here there and when was it written when was this written this letter six about 62. was it right you know you know there's a little give but it's about 62 uh which is a long time ago okay so I think a couple thousand years ago and it was written it was really part one and part two parts chapters one two and three is part one four five and six is part two uh the first part is all about Jesus and how awesome Jesus is and in part two kind of says gear up so if you've ever heard of the full armor of God this is where that comes from in in Ephesians okay and it and the second half also was like Hey get along with each other all right so get along with each other interesting how that message still applies today and so where is Paul writing this letter from he was in prison in what country Italy it was in Rome it was in Rome Italy he was in Italy I'm sorry the uh so he's from in Rome in a prison writing this letter to the church in Ephesus all right so that that's enough for now I'm gonna finish this up here so thank you Pastor enjoy I think somebody's got to get a hearing aid over there yeah so I'll we'll go to get them together the um so I want to give you before we get jumping in here I want to give you an update on our strategy shift at our Revere location we are officially going all in with our dinner Church strategy in Revere uh what that means is that whether you're in Lynn or Revere we will now have three main Services we'll have two traditional services in Lynn 945 and 11 and then on Thursdays at six we'll have a third a church option or service option which looks very different okay it's designed for people that traditional church is complicated for a variety of reasons for them and so dinner church is another expression of church and so if that works for you better feel free to be part of that but we're the goal is to help that grow and expand uh over time both in Revere and in Lynn so anybody that's part of the Sunday or the Thursday Church Expressions is also part of our rest of our ongoing midweek discipleship and bible studies as well so back to Ephesians so the letter to Ephesians tells you who you are in Christ if you want to know if you are a follower of Jesus and you want to know who you are you read Ephesians it lets you know that God has done tremendous fantastic great and wonderful things for us after you read Ephesians if you really understand it you should feel more loved by God than you've ever felt in your life and if you slow read Ephesians which we encourage you to do you can become more capable of doing the things that God actually is asking you to do and feel more equipped to do so perhaps that sense of inadequacy that you felt sometimes can begin to fade away as you begin to allow the book of Ephesians to speak to you we're gonna we're gonna look at uh this week we're going to take a look at Ephesians chapter 1 verses 1 to 3. it's kind of the introduction to the letter uh to the Ephesians now I wanna I wanna help you get this think ancient times two thousand years ago how did people communicate people communicated they would send messages from one person to another they'd say hey when you go to Ephesus can you tell so and so this message okay also back then people didn't all know how to read and write the same way that many of us know how to read and write and so it was a little different they also didn't have a lot of writing utensils and things to write on and so it was a very different era and age so when somebody wrote a letter like when Paul was writing a letter he would write it he would send it to give it to somebody they would take it across the world they would give it to the church and then the church would open it up and read it so hey we got a message from Brother Paul today let's read it right church was longer then all right it was a lot longer than what it would be right now okay it was longer so it's a letter now what's odd about this is that today we don't write letters anymore I mean I don't the last time I wrote a handwritten letter I was six or seven maybe and I did I don't do this very often okay in a very long if you get a handwritten letter from somebody that you know or love like what's going on something's going on I got a hand I mean very some of you are like experts at this but most of you are not we we communicate differently today we uh how we write letters today is like emails emails or text right we text people we DM people I am we do lots of other things so how we communicate with people and sometimes you get a text message you ever get these long text messages if you do that stop just stop email that thing or better yet that's a conversation not a text message okay that's a little bit of relational skills for you right there okay if it takes more than three sentences have the conversation if you're about to say something stupid just don't say it all right you know texting makes you our stupidity come out sometimes but anyhow when we communicate we do a lot of texting but to kind of throw in some energy to that text message we'll drop in an emoji like we've got an emoji with a little smiley face or crying or the other day I said to my daughter I have no idea what that means what is that what does that particular emoji mean yeah or are these these gifs the gifs or gifts or whatever they're called and the uh and you know you're like you're like really excited about something so you put somebody a little dancing person or a moving cow or you know whatever it is that you put on your thing so you're trying to add some flavor to it go back 2 000 years ago people that wrote letters would do the same thing they just didn't have emojis and and digital technology they would add things like poems or a prayer or a song or they would just kind of throw in some bonus stuff that's fun and like to kind of help pay attention okay it's actually this first part is actually a poem prayer type of a situation the very first a few verses we're reading it says this Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the Saints in Ephesus somebody say in Ephesus to the faithful in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus Grace and peace to you from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ praise to to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us in the Heavenly Realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ so this is like a prayer or a praise right there simple and if you're not careful you can just quickly glance over it like maybe it's just the introduction and you want to get onto the real stuff but that is the real stuff right there at the beginning Paul here is the writer of the letter he's an apostle like a messenger of God he he's responsible for starting churches across the known world at the time he was out helping Gentiles meaning non-jews understand who Jesus was and it says here to all the people in Ephesus and he says to the Saints to the Saints now we're in New England and in greater Boston when we think of the word saint we think like a Catholic saint right like virtuous people that are now dead and and they are a saint but that's not the Bible definition the Bible definition of Satan is somebody who's been set apart it comes from the word Sanctified in other words what Paul is saying here is if you're a believer in Jesus you're a saint you've been set apart by God it is somebody who has been set apart and that's what makes you and me a saint not what I do but what God has done for me so if you're with Jesus you're a saint kind of weird to think of yourself as a saint I kind of like it I said that verse in the first service I'm getting used to it now Saint Kurt right you know like like I got on the screen it's the magic now look let's look at Saint Nicholas up here on the screen like now I can't why can't they smile every once in a while you know when they get these pictures of these guys I don't know a long time ago look at now look around at all the saints around you that'll really confused all right you know like like you're a saint I have no idea I think passenger might be wrong on that but yeah so so the point of the first three chapters in Ephesians is you are worthy because of what Christ Jesus has done for you you are worthy because of what Jesus has done for you and the riches that he's given to you not because of what you've done but because of what God has done in your life the Christian life is not about doing it's about what's already been done it's frequently Asked what's the difference between Christianity and other world religions it's very simple it's due versus done do versus done the majority of religions are about being more good gooder about climbing the ladder of goodness swimming across the river of goodness doing more good than bad only to find out that the latter is Too Tall the scale is too lopsided and the river is too wide Christianity centers around Jesus who stopped all that craziness of us chasing after becoming good because with Jesus the work of being good is already done d-o-n-e and because of Jesus we recognize that we are not good on our own and can never be good on our own and that we desperately need God through Jesus to be good for us so because of the life death and resurrection of Jesus he has already done the good work for us if you are with Jesus you are good because Jesus has already done it but if you are not with Jesus you can become good by inviting Jesus to forgive you of your sins and surrender leadership of your life over to him and he has already done the work for you now let me tell you a little bit about Ephesus the city where the church was located that Paul wrote to now it would be like 2 000 years from now people trying to describe what Lynn was like okay no matter you know you kind of fast what would Lynn used to be like so I'm going to try to explain to you what Ephesus was like Ephesus was built originally as a trade City it was at its own Harbor one of the greatest Harbors in ancient history and they did something stupid they took all the forests and cut them down around the rivers and when they did that all the silt over the years all the silt from the hillsides and the land began to wash into the river and the river would carry it down into the harbor and filled up the harbor in fact today if you go to Turkey if you go to Ephesus today it's three miles inland it used to be on the Harbor right it used to be it's three miles Inland not because of global warming but because so much silt came down and filled up the harbor now the harbor uh it became not quite as available as it had been there was still some travel and trade but another industry emerged in the city of about 250 to 300 000 people they turned to tourism like a Disneyland but not Disneyland like a lot worse the center of Tourism was a temple to a goddess named Artemis or Diana who was on the screen the reason that this was such an effective tourist trap is because the worship of Diana all centered around a great fertility cult that's a nice way of saying that this was a bro sexually broken and saturated Society you see they had in this Temple this huge Temple all these priestesses that were actually prostitutes and people went to the temple and they would engage with the prostitutes this was actually prostitutes still even really the wrong word these were slaves this was ancient form of human trafficking and it was prevalent in ancient Society particularly in the city of Ephesus so that's the city where this letter is being written to and where the church was located and what they had to deal with this is what the if all the Ephesians that grew up there that's what they dealt with growing up and this is what Paul had to talk with them about he went there and he he would communicate and he would preach he would explain things about a change in their lives and about how to look at life a whole new way he wasn't trying to condemn them he was offering them a path to Freedom and a path to Freedom specifically with Jesus so Paul came in he was in the midst of this chaotic City and he said hey I got some good news for you and he talked to them about the good news of Jesus and a holy life and wouldn't you know people flocked to it people couldn't believe what they were hearing and they they came looking for it now Ephesus is the city where Paul spent the longest amount of time he stayed there for three plus years helping the church be established it's a place where he had great impact where God used him in a great these great great ways in Acts 19 after a while of being in a in Ephesus preaching at the synagogue and and and and being an area starting the church Paul began to hold daily discussions in the lecture hall of terranu or teranus so every day is in this lecture hall in Ephesus talking to people about Jesus And discussing this and debating this this went on for two years so that the people throughout the province of Asia both Jews and Greeks heard the word of the Lord think about this people from all over the known world were traveling to Ephesus and then going back out they would come in they'd hear about this crazy guy they would go they would listen they would become convinced and then go back to where they were from and tell people about what they heard so it's like this very strategic center it's actually pretty incredible they didn't have any TV back then they didn't have YouTube no Netflix No guest appearances on The Joe Rogan podcast nothing like that okay this was very very different spread it spread out they were teaching uh from this one place so everybody could hear the good news and people responded and had a huge impact huge impact changed the culture of the city kind of like a big Celine Dion in Las Vegas so she has a residency in Las Vegas or had I don't know if she still does but so people from all over the world can fly into Vegas and they can go hear Celine Dion and then they can go back home and tell people what they heard this is kind of this idea come and go it's kind of like that with Paul they would come to the ancient Las Vegas or Ephesus and heard about this unique fellow with some interesting ideas Ephesus is the place where he had the greatest impact it's also the place where he encountered the strongest criticism and you need to know this from the beginning when you follow Jesus legitimately criticism comes right after the story in Acts 19 and 20 some people in Ephesus began to be upset with Paul not because the church was growing not because people were becoming followers of Jesus and hearing it and going out all over the world they were upset at Paul because he he began to preach against the goddess Artemis he began to explain that Artemis was a false god the Artemis was a a demonic in nature and some of the people the the the work people the people that were making the silversmiths you see they would they would in their workplaces they would make these little silver gods they would make little little statues and bigger statues you know all kinds of different statues and they would sell them to tourists that came from all over the world what happened when Paul started having an effective Ministry because people stopped buying those little trinkets and they were selling so many of them that impacted the economy of Ephesus because Paul was convincing people that Artemis was a false demonic God so they got upset and so the people all gathered together about 25 000 people gathered together in the theater in Ephesus you can actually see this is the actual theater where it took place they uncovered it uh a few years ago I'm actually going there in July with my wife and 25 000 people can fit into that theater and the Bible says if this place was crowded and had a huge riot and in this theater over the fact that Paul had had impacted their economy and they started this chant in that theater in Acts 19 verse 28 it says at this they're anger boiled and they began shouting great is Artemis of the Ephesians greatest Artemis of the Ephesians greatest Artemis of the Ephesians that would be loud of 25 000 people pounding it angrily they were mad and with 25 000 people from your town gathered together to criticize you guess what you made a good impact you made a good impact we got strong criticism comes with great impact and when you ask God to use you he will use you and when the impact is made criticism will come right behind it's okay it's okay after his three-year stay Paul continued his ministry in other places and a few years later he eventually ends up in a prison cell in Rome Italy and he does something surprising he begins to write letters to some of the churches in different cities across the world he had helped start now a lot of people when they go to prison that are in a bad spot their letters might look different than Paul's letters or they might just give up Paul got shelved in life he got to prison he got shelved the Roman authorities tried to put Paul on the Shelf and maybe you can identify with that idea of being shelved by a situation or a system but Paul did something fascinating while he was on the Shelf God used him to write and encourage and direct and correct what would eventually become billions of Jesus followers across the globe for the next 2000 years it's incredible what God can do with your life when you are shelved if you don't give up and some of you might be feeling a little bit like that that that you're on the Shelf maybe not much is happening with your life right now don't be so certain that God doesn't want to use you God can take that shelf moment and do something powerful and profound in your life there was an old archaeologist a great archaeologist named William Ramsey and he helped excavate the Ephesus and he said about this he said this about Ephesus in Ephesus and easy going Christianity would never survive it could not have conquered and tamed the world an easygoing Christianity in Ephesus wouldn't have worked Jesus would have become just another God on this Shelf with all the other gods but because they said there's just one way Jesus Christ and we're going to stand for him no matter what they changed the world I think we could replace the word Ephesus with the word America in America an easygoing Christianity won't survive it can't conquer and tame the world and we have the opportunity to do that but if we just say that's good for me but who cares about everybody else they can do whatever they want that will never heal a broken world for Jesus Christ as the worship team comes up I want you to think about this idea consider this we live in two places at the same time Ephesians chapter one says this we read it earlier Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the Saints in Ephesus somebody say in Ephesus okay so this is one place we live in Ephesus or in the world in Lin okay we live in the world to the faithful in Christ Jesus so somebody said in Christ Jesus so now we have over here in Christ Jesus so we're living in two places at the same time in the world and in Jesus Christ we live in Ephesus and we live in Christ we're supposed to be like Jesus and not be like Ephesus we're supposed to live with Jesus and in Jesus and Jesus with us and Jesus in us so that we can live in Ephesus and not be like Ephesus because if you live in Ephesus and you're not with Jesus you're like Ephesus that's how it works and if people can't tell that you're not actually Ephesus check yourself about where you're at in Jesus the book of Ephesians is really a love letter that Paul wrote to his church kind of an appeal to his church from prison almost a decade after he left calling them forth reminding them of who they are in Jesus and to get along with each other and and how to fight in this world that we live in reminding them of who they are in Jesus and how God really sees them and that's a that's a tricky one for us sometimes because let's say that this paper represents you this is this clean pure kind of paper and you're going through life and you hit a couple of snags and then you're like oh I got some I got some wrinkles you try to and then you go a little further in life and the older you get the more things happen I need to try to straighten it out and then somebody does something to you or something harmful said about you or you read Facebook and you found that you got a few more wrinkles few more a few more chinks a few more broken things going on in your life you make some decisions and some of those decisions aren't so good and it messes you up a little here a little there but for being honest a lot of times decisions that break us weren't even our decisions but they still hit us they still messed us up still broken and you keep trying to unwrinkle like really going after it you get maybe a book you put the paper in the book try to flatten it out but no matter what you do it's still broken it's still messed up it's never quite what it was supposed to be again keep on trying keep on moving you keep trying to deal with it just keep getting more and more broken and you just don't know how in the world you're ever gonna be good how you're ever going to be right how you're ever going to get it done Ephesians reminds us God doesn't see us this way God sees us this way because of Jesus Jesus blocks this he sees us like this all the time all the time Ephesians Paul reminding his church that he's helped start God sees you different you can't do it on your own it's already been done why don't you stand with me as we close today so here's what we do would you begin a slow read through Ephesians [Music] because understanding your identity in Christ is absolutely essential to your success at Living a Victorious Christian Life [Music] because Ephesians says you're a saint you are in Christ Jesus in Ephesians we will discover also that you are a powerful Warrior and Conquer and overcomer that's some good stuff and I want to know if that's who I am I need to know Ephesians will let you know and today if you're not with Jesus you can choose to be with Jesus you might not know this but he's actually been chasing after your whole life [Music] your whole life if you've not chosen Jesus maybe today is your chance choose Jesus the worship team is going to close us with this song as they do the altars are open if there's something you want to talk to God about today feel free to come up and talk to God around these altars and let's just sing this together [Music]", "welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting this is pastor dave and this is day four we're jumping right in to our topic for today the ways of god prayer gives us insight not just into what god wants to do but how he wants to do it i'll say that again prayer gives us insight not just on what god wants to do but how he wants to do it i was recently visiting my family in the blue ridge mountain area of north carolina it's this gorgeous place and we were on the side of a mountain and there was a zoo there and in the zoo they had a black bear rolling around scratching himself and i was observing the bear safely and thankfully behind the fence and not really knowing what the bear was doing you know after a while you're just kind of staring at the animal and all of a sudden the caretaker comes by he just happened to be there for a quick uh presentation on the wildlife and you could tell this was this guy's dream job because he was so emotive so compelling as he explained to us the ways of the bear and how a bear thinks and how a bear moves and how a bear smells and you know after that presentation i had a whole different level of respect not just for the trainer or the caretaker but also for the bear because i realized how complex they are and how intimidating they are how misunderstood they are but i understood so much better there's a scene in the bible that reminds me of this acts chapter 2. let me set it up for you before we read it so what's happening is it's the day of pentecost one of the top three festivals of the year for the jewish people they've come from all corners of the earth all different languages down to the city of jerusalem to celebrate this festivity the cities packed the streets you know are full of people and kids and you know you get the idea this religious fervor and at the very same time in that city there were a group of 120 believers in an upper room praying for god to deliver his promise and guess what happens on that day of pentecost god shows up and he delivers his promise he pours out his spirit and the result is that this group the small group of believers are able to buy a miracle of god speak in languages from all over the world that were being spoken at that time without ever having left their hometown they had never learned these languages just by by the spirit of god they were empowered to speak in these languages and everybody hears the commotion they come running you know the whole the whole city comes to see what's going on here and when they get there they hear the message of the things of god things god is doing through these believers in their own languages and some of them are really weirded out like what is going on here others begin to understand and others are mocking and there's a group of them that are mocking them saying you know what these guys are just drunk and this is where peter comes in in verse 16 he says to them no what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet joel in other words peter says to them hey guys this is actually a promise that god made long ago through the prophet joel and then he continues in verse 17. he quotes that that particular passage from joel it says in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit upon all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams in those days i will pour out my spirit even on my servants men and women alike and they will prophesy and he keeps on going on and on but essentially he's saying guys this is that those those you know in those days if these are those days and this is happening now in real time i want to ask you three simple questions as we get ready to pray today first one is can you recognize the promises of god in your life you're praying for promises you're waiting on those promises well if they were to show up today would you be able to recognize them only reason these believers were able to recognize the promises of god is because they had been seeking god they had been in prayer they had been you know intensely going after the things of god the second question is can you recognize the ways of god because let's be honest the way that god showed up that day was really weird let me just be honest about that sometimes god does things in mysterious ways i mean jesus did this all the time and that's not to say that everything that's strange is automatically from god but god likes to you know he likes to bring us out of our comfort zone and are you okay with that are you okay with god bringing you out of your comfort zone are you able to recognize the ways of god last question is are you open to seeing the promises of god in your life most of us would say yeah i want the promises of god the blessings of god the more the better but the real question is are you available mary the mother of jesus upon hearing that she would be the one to bring jesus into the world said this i am the lord's servant may everything you have said about me come true and then the angel left her she wasn't just saying yeah god that sounds awesome do your thing she was saying god use me do it through me let's pray god today we give you thanks for being so kind i pray that you would give us eyes to see and the ability to see clearly when you show up and deliver your promises help us to not be confused not be misled and help us to step forward god and make ourselves available to you do whatever you want to do through us god we don't want to miss out we don't want to be mockers we don't want to be faithless we want to be on your side if you want to bring me out of my comfort zone you're welcome to do so god whatever it takes to see change and transformation we pray this in jesus name amen thank you so much for your time we'll see you again tomorrow bye",

what's up here that's not in land but you 13 miles from the airport right and you got public transit you can get to the airport okay what else is missing in Lynn that's not up here hospital is missing that's important stuff what else is up here that's not in land what a what enough School space so where do we put our school at over here oh right there so we don't have enough schools housing you don't have enough of this let's go a little bit deeper um if that's all you all are missing you're doing okay right it's not perfect right it's not eating right it's pretty good somebody told me this is a Melting Pot Community right it's not you don't have really have segregation of you know ethnic groups in a certain you know relegated place you do have some poverty and some some crime and drugs and that kind of thing let's go to the poorest Community close to land what is that is Lynn it is land it is land okay so Linfield probably got all of this right and some linfield's good what about um areas of Boston Casa Mia that's the neighborhood Thursday okay okay so every one of these is a system call this the transits system right the postal service is a system of delivering mail um Police Department the policing system schools a school system an education system right governments are providing services but they do it through a system Church is Distributing spiritual knowledge through systems right we have systems to get into the church systems to operate when you're in the church who gets to teach they go through a system we call a seminary right you have certain classes that work that you require who gets to teach in the school we have a system before you get into the system physically you've got to go through another system right all of these are representative of systems but in poorer communities of poverty these systems were not designed for certain people to participate in Let me Give an example the housing system there are certain towns Across America that in the 50s 60s and 70s had restrictive covenants that certain people could not buy in that neighborhood you couldn't sell your house to a Dominican or an African-American or an Irish person they were Covenant they were laws that were restricting it that were backed up govern governmentally so which meant and the quickest way to build wealth in America is through real estate right the the most effective way of transferring generational wealth is through real estate and so if you have historically generations of people that were not allowed to participate in this system they're certainly not going to participate in this system called the banking industry right that's why we have that uh that that wealth statistic that was up there right is about assets so we haven't been able to participate because of our ethnicity or you know our skin color or whatever the other category is in this system and so we certainly don't have the wealth and if you don't have the wealth you might end up in the homeless shelter you know you may you may end up in the poor school because the school that is in your community is not funded as well as the school is in this community systems it wasn't until 1968 that the federal government created the Congress created the Fair Housing Act 1968 how many years ago is that 32 54 years ago 54 years ago people of color could now on paper buy wherever they wanted to buy and live wherever they wanted to live 55 54 years ago right America's been around since this I'm here right 1776. man I'm I'm at a place of History that's what 200 I I you know some of y'all graduated magna laude I graduated thank you Lord so my my math is a little but almost 300 years almost 300 that's like a 250 year Head Start that anglos have had participating in some of these systems imagine if we were having a foot race and you had a 50-yard head start on me and we're going 50 more yards after that you're probably going to win I'm gonna give it everything I got I'm gonna be super exhausted at the end of that race and you know don't turn around and say well you did well but you know you should have won the race Walter you got a head start on me so the housing system educational system can you talk about that what's been the history of the educational system in America [Music] have the best schools but even before that we were we there were segregated schools separate but unequal right you can y'all sure you can go to the black school but here are our school books from 10 years ago good luck and not resourced as well and was it Brown versus Board of Education that eliminated segregation in schools so that now in some instances children could go where they want to go not in all this it's because there's still some systemic stuff that limits that and so what do we see today we are reaping what we have sown we're reaping what we have sown to a large degree uh when it comes to education and in some of these schools black and brown children are suspended and expelled at a higher rate than Anglo children remember we talked about the the man who was uh was bird watching in New York City and and simply because his skin color the woman failed threatened he didn't do anything physically to threaten her there's a racialization a Consciousness a impression in the mind that the lighter my skin is the more Superior the more privileges I'm entitled to can you imagine if a teacher comes into a classroom with that mentality and the children before them are black and brown or red and yellow can you imagine the damage that can be inflicted in a classroom the trauma uh and and it's not necessarily overt and blatant um what other system the employment system was that right here the employment system but it's always been equal right for people of color in America yeah all right another inequity in in our own in our own denomination the Assemblies of God started in 1914 in Hot Springs Arkansas when it started it started as an predominantly not with the intent and and promoted to be an all-white organization but that's what it was prior to the establishment of our denomination most of the people who had ministerial credentials they were given them by a black man by the name of Bishop Charles Harrison Mason who's the founder of the Church of God in Christ which is the largest Pentecostal denomination in America and it's still predominantly black but it has other ethnicities it's Global as well but remember 1900s was a very interesting time in America what was going on then Jim Crow it was only 37 years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed 1863. so in that very short period of time there was even though uh enslaved people were now emancipated on paper that didn't manifest itself they they weren't they weren't brought to this nation to participate in these systems they were brought to this nation to work for free and to support those who these systems were created to support and provide for these systems were not built for Dominicans and for Jamaicans and for Africans uh and Asians these systems primarily were built and designed from the foundation of this nation for anglos and the and the and the myth of race was used to justify the fact that we can discriminate in terms of housing it was only through protests and through civil rights uh uh a protest and and through pressure and speaking truth to power that laws were changed but it might be changed on paper but how do we change the heart how do we change the mind so the housing system the employment system uh so I was in our fellowship today the roots of of where we were where we started 1914 was still dealing with that today uh to the degree that we do not have and have never had an African-American a person who looks like me who is a district superintendent in a hundred and eight years we have one assistant superintendent in Northern California who looks like me 108 years and that's because this system right here we got systems in here too foreign they weren't necessarily designed for us let me tell you all why I think that's true I'm going to take you to some can I can I share a little scripture with you all let's go to Matthew chapter 13. oh beef why you turned into Matthew 13 can you play that SNL video I just think this is funny you gotta watch this Mr Robinson's neighborhood as opposed to Mr Roberts as a video was playing I started thinking about sports entertainment these systems weren't designed for people of color we have to create our own I heard of the Negro League the greatest ball players today in the major league are from the Spanish Nations and Islands it wasn't until the 50 what Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier right these systems weren't designed for us the police system is rooted in slave catching right and and so those systems still exist and unless we as Believers not only get that cancer out of us we got to get it out of the systems right because remember what Justice is Justice goes upstream and finds out who's throwing the people into the water that are drowning we can save them all day and and and we're going to lose some but we got to go back and change the systems you got to understand the systems why they were created how they created deconstruct the systems and then we can reconstruct with a mindset in the heart of God let me take you to the scripture Matthew chapter 13. uh that may help us to know how to do this in verse 24 the English Standard Version Jesus put another Parable before them saying the Kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field this is this is all good seed right this is this these are the ingredients of a great neighborhood right somebody planted an airport thought man we need we need to be able to get around not just through Uber and train and bus we'd be able to fly they planted all of these good seeds this Parable to me not only relates to the kingdom of heaven I believe we can make some applications to America cities particularly to cities that are good and cities that are impoverished but verse 25 says while his men were sleeping now I believe that the men in this Parable is the church it's the big sea church because you know what happened while this while the city was sleeping uh many white churches left the city like man them people of color coming in here I'm leaving I'm going to the suburb there were many who left this church because it got ethnically diverse it did start looking like my majority culture anymore where I thought I was entitled to certain privileges while we were sleeping America's inner cities happened it happened on all of our watch red yellow black white and brown as not just uh anglos moving out God spoke to me after a mission strip one day I was actually in the Middle East in Saudi Arabia on a missions trip uh you don't do missions in Saudi Arabia you do business as Mission and uh I was there praying and I felt like the Lord said to me we'd have to have the whole church red yellow black white and brown taking the whole gospel the vertical and the horizontal the do justice love Mercy walk Huntley with your God that's the whole gospel it's not an either or right so long we for so long we've been we've been forced to choose social or biblical no that's not the whole gospel that's part of it you put it both together you do justice love mercy and walk humbly you love God and you love your neighbor Justice is fixing broken things right we need the whole church taking the whole gospel to the whole world globally and locally and for so long many anglo-believers have prioritized taken the gospel across the sea we'll fly right over communities that are broken fly right over children that are not being educated well to build a school in a third world country build it paint it furnish it right build a medical center when there are people right in our own backyard because they don't look like us we were sleeping so God said we need the whole church to take the whole gospel to the whole world we got to care for uh Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the outermost part of the world but you can't just forget about Jerusalem where you live and the people that you see on the news every night that are in pain in poverty and plight he said we need to heal the ignorance of the white portion of my church and we need to heal the indifference of the black and brown portion of my church because there's an ignorance of black and brown people who often are living in these places of pain and they see themselves as the mission field like hey I need some help I need the church to give me something and yes that that's true but you're also called to go and be a Ambassador for Jesus you're not just the mission field you're not just a recipient you're also to be a distributor but there has to be an in the healing of indifference of the white members of the body of Christ to realize that we're many members yet we're one body and what happens to one happens to all of us Dr King said either we learn to live together as brothers or we'll perish together as fools he says we are we are knit together in a in an inescapable Garment of mutuality what happens to one happens to the other a Justice threatened anywhere is a threat to Justice everywhere and so this parable speaks about I believe the church sleeping this happened on our watch these inner cities happen while we were focused on other things focused on our own priorities while we were sleeping his enemy came and the enemy is the enemy it's not just Satan sometimes the enemy is in on me say the word enemy real slow and uh me yep it's in you he's in you remember we got to get it out every day we got to find ways to get it out the enemy came and sold weeds among the wheat and went away and when the plants came up and bore grain the weeds appeared also and the Servants of the Master of the House came and said to his master master didn't you not sow good seed in your field how then does it have weed so the plants came up and they don't always come up right away sometimes it's a generation later that we see it sometimes there's two generations later sometimes we move from the suburb and it's and we don't live in that neighborhood anyway so we don't see it but the plants are coming up we are going to reap what we sow [Music] we're going to reap what we sow what we do as a result after today will have an impact sometime you won't even be here to see it but it's coming up good or bad the servant said did you not plant good seed in your field verse 27 how then does it have weeds so that speaks about the church looking for answers how do we fix this how do we how do we get the weeds out we need a strategy and and we can't be impatient we can't be irrational we can't just bring anger and intensity I call that heat you got to bring some light fire gives you heat but it also gives you light you got to have some strategy and so they said master do you want us uh the the master identifies it as the enemy he says do you want us to go and gather them together he wants to pull it up and the master says no in verse 29 less than Gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them let them both grow together until the Harvest and that Harvest time I will tell the Reapers gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn we need a strategy I think we're here today because we care about Justice we want to we want a strategy from God lord are we always going to be dealing with this how do we fix it what's the strategy it reminds me of the movie hidden figures with uh the late Catherine Johnson I think she just died a year or two ago at a age 100 101 one of the most brilliant mathematicians and engineers and female black scientists that the world has ever known and if you remember the movie hidden figures these black women who were brilliant they were not allowed to participate governmentally in this so that they can impact this and so they could impact that and they were relegated to a portion of the base they were in like the basement you remember she had to go a mile to use the bathroom every day and he's like how come you're never at work how come you're never at your station when I need you said listen if the if I was allowed to use the white folks bathroom that's another system if I was allowed to drink from the white bubbler that's another system right I had to go across base a mile to use the bathroom but anyhow she finally is brought into the War Room when they're trying to figure out a strategy we know how to get John Glenn up into orbit we just don't know how to get him back safely we need a strategy and and Kevin Costner who's one of my favorite actors black people don't just like Denzel and Taraji Henson I like some white actors too right Kevin Costner he's my guy uh Robert Duvall is another one I love him Godfather movies and you know western movies but anyhow Kevin Costner is looking at this this these math statistics that they have to try to figure out how to get John Glenn back and he says we need a new math we need a new math we need a new strategy because what we have been doing is not working and Catherine Johnson says Euler's method all his method was an old ancient mathematic equation or system of math that can be applied to new problems and she runs across the base where she was going to the bathroom goes down into the basement into where the black folks were she pulls off the shelf in the library a book with Euler's method math and the next portion of the movie She's erasing stuff and writing new math figures and figures out how we're going to get John Glenn back I believe that the Euler's method that we need it's in scripture it's in scripture when we get people who recognize we're better together we're in this thing together we need one another and we're all called to Justice we're called to be more proud of the grace of God than this construct socially that was created called race because race divides us race ostracizes us Grace brings us together that's how we build a beautiful neighborhood some things that I want you to begin to think about over lunch and we come back we'll do some more discussion is how can we better Express Christ's love across different cultures hour ago or so we were talking about cultural intelligence how can we better Express Christ's love across different cultures this is a Melting Pot I mean it's this is like this is like Jerusalem like the world has come together in land and if you don't have cultural intelligence my God you you're gonna burn a lot of bridges but if you do if you do have it imagine the the connections that can occur to the glory of God yeah what can we learn from people who are different than than us or different what can you learn from people that are different than you think about what are some of the unique practices that your own cultural group engages in and ask do any of these practices result from being in a racialized society think about this last session on a beautiful neighborhood and maybe pray and think about and talk about what are some of the systems that I am in that I've been empowered God has sent me he's planted me here to impact them to change him from the inside out and God showed me a strategy give me a new math on how I can make this my own personal mission I'm I'm committed to East Coast International Church and I this is my place of worship and my spiritual house and that's my pastor but I'm also on Mission here you are on Mission you are a pastor of housing or a pastor of the playground or a pastor of the school you are on Mission in that place and the spirit of The Sovereign God is upon you he's anointed you to bring Heaven on Earth in these places there's a there's a form on your seat I want you to refer to before we go to break it's called the seven forms of racism seven forms of racism uh Jesse after we go through these forms we're going to look at that video that's at the end of this um I edited this for break for brevity it's not my own thought racism refers to a variety of practices believe social relations and phenomenon that work to produce a racial hierarchy and a social structure that yields superiority power and privilege for some and discrimination and oppression for others that's what we saw visually up here seven main forms representational racism depictions of racial stereotypes and popular culture and media remember the pictures of the Disney movies the picture of Aunt Jemima you know people dressed in blackface you know different characters that's race that's representational racism common depictions we see in mascots the Indians the Braves the Redskins and isn't it interesting the last couple years the Washington team they used to be with the Washington team last year now they're the Guardians thank you they beat my Packers up a couple of weeks ago um the Indians have become the Indians are the Guardians the Redskins no commanders it's the Washington commanders this is the commanders yeah but in Cleveland is the Guardians now yeah Atlanta say we ain't letting this go right we're going to be the Braves I don't care what y'all say we got money we're dominant these ideas and images imply inferiority and often stupidity and untrustworthiness representational racism then there's ideological racism World Views beliefs and Common Sense ideas that are rooted in racial stereotypes like black women are sexually promiscuous stereotypes that Latin women are fiery or heart-tempted stereotypes that black men and boys are criminally oriented now you can imagine if ideological racism has its root even just a taint of that in your lungs and you are in a position of power in any of these systems it's coming out because whatever is in you is coming out um examples the belief that white and light-skinned people are more intelligent and Superior than dark-skinned people white people are not the only one that believe ideological racism one of the consequences of being in a racialized society is that other ethnic groups also embrace colorism yeah amongst black folks right he got good hair you know he he got he's okay but if mine grew out that's not good hair that's ideological racism the lighter your skin the more intelligent uh the the closer to the standard of beauty who sets the standard of beauty right what's wrong with having thick lips and a wide nose and dark skin who who said that was wrong ideological racism then there's discursive racism this is racism that's expressed through our speech hate speech racial slurs code language sometimes you see it on the media you know in in movies or on the on the local news code words like you know Thug ghetto gangster even some of our politicians throw those words around you know he's this is just a thug you know get rid of all those thugs also what you mean that's the black males that's what you're talking about right it's it's it's it's just discursive racism and then there's interactional racism racism that's expressed in how we interact with each other for example a wider Asian woman may cross the street to avoid passing closely by a black or a latino man she may clutch her purse a little bit closer that's reactional interactional um is is very subjective you you may not even notice it if you're part of dominant culture but I guarantee that if you're black or brown you've been in America more than two weeks you've experienced some of this when a white person calls the police to report a black man is bird watching or when someone automatically assumes that a person of color is a low-level employee or an assistant and not the owner right that's interactional then there's institutional racism it's ways that policies and laws are crafted and pulled put into practice like housing laws and educational laws and where you can live and you know the system of redlining that created ghettos those those that's institutional racism uh the world drugs which disproportionately targeted neighborhoods of color the debate now in my state is that uh the legalization of marijuana is on the ballot coming up on November when's Election November whatever that Tuesday is second Tuesday of November um and was it last month or a month before that that President Biden um changed the uh through executive order I don't know if it was a pardon or release of those who have been committed to low-level marijuana marijuana crimes right because the government through the world on drugs had created a system that disproportionately affected people of color crack cocaine as opposed to powder cocaine and crack cocaine receiving more harsher longer sentences than powder cocaine government systems institutionalized Prejudice plus power then their structural racism it refers to the ongoing historical and long-term reproduction of the racialized structure of our society structural racism manifests itself in large-scale and widespread racial segregation on the basis of Education income and wealth examples of the displacement of people of color from neighborhoods through a process called gentrification boys and girls I saw the video and systemic racism uh let's Play that video it's a video on systemic racism", "all right here we go the uh can you hear me how Okay so the so if you're over 50 you know what that was if you're not you have no idea what what just happened right there right there so we got a little Sesame Street action going on right there the um so numbers think about numbers for a second you're going to be humming that all day long I apologize I apologize there's this guy named Fibonacci this guy named Fibonacci changed the modern world uh many hundreds of years ago he changed the modern world by popularizing something that we use every single day that's numbers he he he's the one that popularized the numbers that you and I use today he needed to make a change uh in how he could do something if he was going to solve this particular problem this mathematical problem so he shifted from using the Roman numeral system that everybody was using that most of you can't get past like 10 on right so uh you know it's it's like 10 and who knows after that no clue what the Super Bowl year is we're in anymore it's just too too high right so they use Roman numerals to say what year the Super Bowl is so everybody was using these Roman numerals and he couldn't figure out the math problem using Roman numerals so he shifted to this other system that uses the numbers that we use today the Lord and so because of that he was able to find a solution to the math problem because he he he he was able to use this other system that he had learned somewhere else and he popularized it he had to ask a lot of really good questions in the midst of a really big problem and sometimes when you and I are in the midst of a really big problem and have overwhelming challenges there are solutions in unexpected places there are scenarios that God can present to us that cause us to shift the way we think or do or hear and often times I find that God will simply start to ask us questions God asked good questions last week God asked Moses what is in your hand right ask God he asked Moses what was in your hand and that the challenge for Moses was to give God what was in his hand today I want you to watch this next account with this critical question that God asks or that the lady is asked on behalf of God in 2 Kings chapter 4 is where we'll pick up the story there's a wife of a man from the company of prophets and she cried out uh to Elisha your servant my husband is dead and you know that he is revered that he revered the Lord so to be clear we have this Widow uh they we have Elisha who is a prophet of God and now they're they're talking but now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves that's a really rough uh debt system Elisha replied to her how can I help you tell me what do you have in your house now when I'm when I read this I think oh that's interesting he he's going to like set up a yard sale for her or maybe like post things on eBay on Marketplace you know that's what that's what it kind of looks like is getting ready to happen your servant has nothing at all she said except somebody say except except except a little oil Elisha said go around and ask your neighbors for empty jars don't ask for just a few then go inside and shut the door behind you you and your sons pour oil into all the jars remember she only has a little oil into all the jars and as each is filled put it to one side she left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons they brought the jars to her and she kept pouring when all the jars were full she said to her son bring me another one but he replied there is not a jar left then the oil stopped flowing she went and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil pay your debts you and your sons can live on what is left so here's here's here's what's going on her husband's passed away she had inherited her husband's debts that's rough those debts were so bad that the creditors were on their way to take the boys as slaves to pay the debt this woman literally was at a place where she had lost or was about to lose everything and inside of the story is this idea this is not a bad woman she didn't do anything to cause this in fact she was a Godly woman and it highlights this important thing for us to pay attention to that uh this woman is experiencing the realities of living in a broken and Fallen World oh no amen and we also can relate to that because we all live in a broken and Fallen World and sometimes we experience in our own Liv the consequences of what is happening in this broken world even if we weren't the ones that did it it's just a reality of living in a broken world so even her husband Not only was she a a Godly woman her husband was a righteous man who helped proclaim the ways of God and now here she is destitute broke and in trouble and the attitude that this woman could have had could have been a really tough attitude she could have come at this with a why isn't God helping me we are God's people why why isn't everybody doing their part to to to help me not lose my sons I've been faithful to God and just kind of flip God the bird right you know that's kind of the attitude that I think a lot of people might have here but she kept her attitude in check and this is the critical part here she did not allow her situation to dictate her faith yes her faith dictated her response to the situation and it is in difficult moments like these where you really come to it it's really where you come to understand where you're at with your faith it's how you respond in difficult moments she she had lost everything but she had not lost her faith and so the good news here is that she had she went to the prophet Elisha she went to the prophet elishah to seek an answer from God she went to this man of God the wife of a man from the company of prophets cried out to Elisha that's in verse one that's where we saw got that and today wherever you're at today and whatever challenge you've brought in with you today whatever obstacle whatever pain whatever past whatever hurt if you've come to the end of your ability with that if you've come to the end of your resources if you've come to the end of your road hope so to speak then pay attention to what this woman does and how she reaches out to God she's looking she's opening up her heart she's expecting uh a miracle she's expecting something different than what is happening and this idea of belief in a difficult place is important yes believe that God has an answer and is going to move on your behalf that is a that is an important uh place of belief it's an important uh skill set it's an important authentic understanding of what the character of God is and that God is for you and not against you he authentically wants to intervene as you already know here in the city of Lynn we we wrestle with uh an epidemic of addiction here in our city I I just to put this very directly I have done far more drug overdose funerals than I have done natural funerals natural cause funerals we fundamentally have a problem yet inside the challenge of this epidemic we get to see Miracles take place because sometimes people get to a place and they authentically surrender to God they're not just white knuckling it they're not just trying to come up with a better strategy they fundamentally surrender to God and they seek God with all their heart they come to the end of their rope and they let go and they let let God they what do they let God do they let God restore their lives and many of you are here today in this church you are proof that God is at work still putting the pieces of lives back together this is the nature of what it means to surrender to let God Philippians says my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus listen God does not abandon the righteous he does not forsake his ch children and this is really hard I know in in in our culture it's really difficult to get your head around this idea that God will not forsake you because so many of our Earthly fathers did so many Earthly fathers walked away from their children but when God becomes your father he will never forsake you he will never Abend on you he will never walk out on you and in our city we have this tragedy that's so pronounced literally we have classrooms in our schools where a whole classroom will only have one or two kids that have a present father in their life we live in a society of unfathered children when fathers have abandoned their children physically or emotionally or financially or spiritually it's a problem it's not we're so used to it we're so used to it that that it's just accepted normal practice but it's not neutral on it creates emotional chaos and financial chaos and physical chaos and spiritual chaos in people's lives and because of this culture of absent fathers we have many in our culture that unintentionally have attributed the qualities of an absent father to the qualities of God and they think that God is dist or unattached or unconcerned but the scriptures bear out that God is Not distant that God is not hiding that God is not so mad at you that he doesn't want to have anything to do with you in fact God Sorrows when his creation does not run to him come on now when confusion or complications or disappointment or tragedy come into your life he does not want you to run away from him he doesn't even care if you're mad at him even if it's incorrectly he still just wants you to run to him amen he invites you to come close to him yes and so don't run from your heavenly father run to him because it it's in the presence of God that Deliverance will authentically come Hallelujah his Deliverance comes in his presence and part of the problem that we continue to face is that we live in a time of cursed Generations literally we have multiple generations of families that have not had any relationship with Christ one generation after another after another after another after another have no understanding of Jesus whatsoever that no longer has to be the case because the change to that can start with you you see the change that takes place in your life when you respond to Jesus your the change in your life in your family uh changes the future of your life and the future of your family for your kids and your grandkids and your great-grandkids and if you don't have biological kids for your spiritual children and your spiritual grandchildren amen and it starts to change and there are great things that take place downline when that happens my I I have a different kind of a story my my mother and father loved Jesus my whole life and my mother's parents love Jesus her whole life and my father's parents love Jesus his whole life and I can tell you that story for the next 20 minutes going back generation after generation after generation after generation at least five generations Hallelujah and my great-grandfather Charles used to pray for my wife before I was born hallu I never knew my great-grandfather I never met him but he prayed for my wife before I was born some of you didn't have that amen about it but I have literally had generational blessings passed down in my life one generation after another generation after another generation after another generation they were breaking one curse after another after another after another after another and so I'm not handed generations of generational curses and I want you to get this loud and clear today when you choose Jesus you draw a line in the sand and you are breaking the curse and in Jesus name that curse is broken for you and the generations that follow and you will pray for your great-grandchildren spouses before they are even born and you may never know them but they will rise up one day and call you blessed Hallelujah and the Widow in the Bible story today this Bible account she knew that she needed to get an answer from God she needed to call out to God I mean she left a generational blessing for all of we're still talking about this lady thousands of years later she needed to call out to God she was at the end of what she thought was her life she was at the end of her rope and there was only one hope and she chose to call out to God yes in response to her request for help she's asked the question here's the question for us today tell me what do you have in your house the question is what's in your house what a what a great question to be asked you know for for us today if you're like ah I got a TV you're missing the point today okay like like in the heart the house of your heart what what is in your house maybe some practical things too some actual tangible things as well but but this is a kind of a big question for us today what is in what do you have in your house it's it's simple it starts with what you have that's the qu what do you have not with it's not you're not being asked the question what don't you have amen you're being asked the question what do you have and that way you're not leading with your excuses or not leading with your challenges or not leading with your lack not leading with your past not leading with uh your Awards or your family connections or it's not about any of that what's in your house oh no where's your focus today is your focus on what you don't have is your focus on what has gone before or is your focus on what you believe that God is going to do with what you do have you see everybody has something even if you can't get your head around that idea everybody has something amen don't believe the lie that you have nothing to offer because even the smallest of thing that you have the smallest of gift that you have in God's hands can do great Miracles amen what this woman thought was essentially nothing just except a little bit of oil what does woman thought was nothing was about to become everything that she needed yes she said your servant has nothing there at all she said except a little oil and she began to collect empty jars and go inside and begin to fill the jars with oil and she took action and she began to act in faith you do not see miracles in your life because you're such a good Christian come on there a big misunderstanding around this you don't see Miracles because you're the best at being a Christian you don't see Miracles because you're the best Jesus follower in the whole world right like because you love him so much or because of your sweet and generous disposition you see Miracles because of Faith yes and it starts by praying with your words which is literally just part one of praying yeah you pray with your words and then there's a second part to prayer which is part two which is where you pray with your feet you pray with your words and you pray with your feet that's a complete prayer and that involves faith faith includes an action component following the words that releases Miracles faith means Bel beling God more than believing what is right in front of you it it's believing God more than you believe your five senses and that's really difficult for us as Western people in a western culture it's very difficult I mean things are getting so hard to believe anyhow you don't know if a video is a real video anymore it used to be well let let's see the video well there's AI now I have no idea if that video is true it's wild and so in our life in our relationship with God having faith does not mean no doubt it doesn't mean being free of doubt in fact doubt is an essential ingredient to Faith come on there can be no faith if there is no doubt amen you're choosing to act on the faith side of it instead of the doubt side of it yeah it means acting on the belief that you have of what God has said and will do instead of in your own doubt so where's your faith today where's it at that's a that's just like a a checkup you're doing a a self checkup today where's my faith and what's in my house what what is God saying to you that would require you to step out in faith yes so what's in your house one of the things that I really love about what happened in this account is that the the woman understood that when God speaks or when uh the prophet spoke to her that she just needed a listen she just needed to do what God said to do and there is a great uh thing that one learns over the course of Decades of following Jesus and that is the faster you obey the better amen that rapid obedience matters that uh When God says it and you do it that's the best strategy okay so when you're reading this scripture and it jumps out at you and you know oh man that's me don't just don't just meditate on that for the next three years go and start doing that all right you go start doing it and God speaks to us in a variety of different ways and it gets our attention in a variety of different ways and that that learning how to be rapidly obedient matters it took me a while in my life to get this it took I'm not saying I'm perfect at it but I'm better at it that What Not Today Than I Used to Be and uh for those of you that heard this story just bear with me but when I was about 10 years old um I learned a lesson from God the hard way and um I was out swimming in a lake and Wisconsin and I was just out there with me in an inner tube on a nice cold lake on a hot day and then it started to rain and uh the rain was warm it was warm rain and so it was like perfect to be to be in the lake out there swimming and uh it was great and my mom sticks her head out at my grandparents place and she yells at me and says Kurt it's starting to rain you need to come in all right now and so I went in like a good no I didn't go in I didn't go in at all I uh I was like this is great out here I'm just playing around you know doing whatever I'm going to do taking my own sweet time thinking maybe I should go in sometime but but then my then my mom here's I hear some lightning we hear some lightning off in the distance my mom comes out and says Kur I hear lightning you need to come in get out of the rain and I was unconcerned by what she asked me to do and I just kept playing uh in in in the lake with this inner tube and um and one more time the the the storm's getting closer it's getting closer you can see the the gray clouds coming in you can see the lightning bolts now and a big loud one happens and my mom a little bit scared at this point comes out and she says Lang you get back in she used my middle name and I'm not telling you what it is and so she says my she she she gets me back in the house she said you get back in here right now or you're going to get struck by lightning that's what she says to me and so I'm on the inner tube just swimming having a great time and I'm like what I can't I can't hear you Mom what are you saying I'm too far away right so I just completely ignore everything and I go like this as soon as I make this really defiant decision and go I get struck on the butt by lightning 100% true I have authentically been struck by lightning um that that day and I got to tell you I got back in the house real fast after that okay one I wasn't dead I had no like brain damage that I can tell did some weird stuff to my hair okay it was it was crazy but I'm like back in up and as I'm running back in like terrified for my life that I just got struck by lightning I feel like I hear the voice of God say to me next time listen to your mom right so listen if you heard that story 75 times right now listen half the church hasn't heard it it's okay they uh uh 100% true so when you ask me later yes it's 100% true the idea here is rapid obedience is better than delayed obedience okay it prevents a lot of damages when God speaks to you listen and obey the woman in the story begins to pour the oil the oil that she had into the empty jars big and small and round and Tall painted and plain now I so wish that we had a video recording of uh the kids going out knocking on the doors around town say hey can I have your jars please just I want the empty jars no no no all the empty jars we want and what those discussions were like and how long that took it just I would just be intrigued to know like was this like a halfday project and it take like 12 minutes how many people were in the village I don't know any of that but here's this they went out and they did whatever it was that they were asked to do and they brought the empty jars in all different kinds and these jars are being filled and when you're at the end of your rope when your resources have run dry when time is running out when opportunities cannot be found be very careful to do what you are asked to do by God to gather the jars and fill them with the oil that you have remaining yes when you obey the instruction of the Lord and act in faith so that his promises may be fulfilled in your life you might think to yourself that you don't have all that much by your your way of thinking but if the little that you do have is put to God's disposal you'll see exactly what God can do with it remember God created us out of a mound of dirt just some dust he created the entire Earth out of a formless void he can do a whole lot of something with what seems to us like nothing and it's but it's not just our material needs remember it's all of our needs I'll read it again Philippians 4:19 and the same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ jesusall as the worship team comes up remember when you're being asked by God what is in your house you should hear you should hear or see the wink of God and know there's a miracle in your house Hallelujah if he's if he's going to take the time to ask what's in your house that means there's a miracle in your house and God's Miracles start with what you have his so what have you got in your house you don't have to be some super gifted genius in order for God to step in and help you on in fact God often times chooses the most unlikely of candidates amen he doesn't so so much look for your special abilities but rather he looks for your special availability amen what have you got in your house and whether you realize it or not there is a miracle in your house today and God wants to make that available to you would you stand as we close today Hallelujah [Music] so as we reflect today it's actually quite simple what is in your house yeah and as you listen to God on this as you respond what is in your house the real choice is will I give it to God or not will I will I give this to God today so respond how you like but the the altars are open you can take some time to pray let's just just just reflect and see what God has to say to you today [Music]", "wow that was epic uh I think that was awesome uh not as awesome as Adam's men's Retreat video a few weeks ago but that was really epic you guys um I'm so excited but I'm excited to preach the word but can you guys just take a look around Stacy came up and say she goes second service is lit and she's right I'm just so glad that you are all here it's nice to see faces that I know some I haven't seen in a while some I got to meet you today I'm Pastor Tanisha I'm one of the associate pastors here laughs wow thank you thank you first service didn't do that so thank you just kidding hey I'm just I'm so happy to be here I am so grateful that we serve a God who is good a God that we can trust a God that we can look to that our God is so good and he has good things in store for us now um before I jump into this I just want to share with you that this upcoming August August 27th we have a baptism Sunday you need to put that in your calendar right now it's okay if you need to take out your phone I won't be I know you're not being rude right now put it in your calendar because it is a highlight of our year it's one of the best things we do we have Christmas parties that's fun and all we got Wednesday night that's incredible but baptism Sunday come on we're gonna go we go down in the hunt Beach and we get to celebrate with people who have decided to follow Jesus in getting baptized and for those of you who would say you know what I really want to follow Jesus I would love to give my life to following Jesus I want to get baptized I'm about to go in the water come out it's okay we'll make sure it's clean last year we delayed it because it wasn't clean enough but we get to celebrate with each other we go down to the beach we hear about what God is doing in the lives of people it is truly an exciting celebration and then afterwards we hang out we got food it's a good time so if that is you and you decide you know what I'm ready I want to make this decision you can chat with Pastor Emily you can go on the church Center app if you don't know what that is you can ask someone around you because she has a couple of classes just to let you know a little bit about what it is that you are doing so baptism Sunday August 27th we're gonna be there if you're going to be there that's awesome uh six o'clock maybe I don't remember but you know what I'm the awesome video that Pastor Jesse does they'll tell you someone on there will tell you I think it's at six o'clock but anyways um I just want to let you guys know Sunday is such a fun day of the week we get to come here we get to celebrate today together we get to have good coffee good times and last Sunday I had a great Sunday I had a great Sunday I got the Sabbath and I got to think about how good God is that he would give gift us with the example to rest um so last night I woke up I had a great morning my dogs and went out came back in nice and easy had a good breakfast from Dunkin Donuts I go through the drive-through sip sip nice and fastly the way that it should be no one's in front of me I'm driving no traffic on the way to church I get to come here get to serve God's people his church we get to worship together and Man In Worship especially in second service I feel like the holy spirit is just moving right yeah Professor David he preached a great sermon that just challenged me spoke to my spirit and then after church my friends and I a group of us we went together to this beach in Wilmington it's awesome costs money but it's worth it we got this little Lake and we just had such a good time we ate together we had the kids they were laughing I was dying because I caught a picture of it you know the kids they're sitting there having lunch sitting on the beach eating some chicken wings just having a good time we're in the lake the day was beautiful skies were clear we got little fish swimming around eating you you know and I got to watch my uh friends from church enjoy each other enjoy the day and it was really exciting for me because some of them began to share God's good news with some of the strangers they just met at the beach it was all so good and you know what's funny for me is that it's really different from how I was first introduced to the idea of a Sabbath you see my sister and I we went to church off and on as a kid God always had some random person in our Lives who would ask my mom if they could bring us a church and to all of you who do this Charlie I'm looking at you thank you because there's some little girl somewhere some little boy who's going to grow up and it's gonna be because you do that but they follow Jesus but literally the most random people my mom worked at Ruby Tuesday's one of her co-workers Moms come in and says hey I'm gonna bring your kids to church and she said Okay pop so we would go to church with her I don't even know if like my mom knew her I don't know how often they talked it was real random and then a few years later we had another lady randomly in the neighborhood who would have the kids over do programs in the backyard we'd be eating popcorn I really don't even know if my mom knew this was happening we just were there and all the time God always had someone in our Lives who would share Jesus with us and there was a period of time that my mom even came with us this was one of my sweetest memories from my childhood you know we would say they would be singing together I'd be smelling her coffee breath thinking wow Church and it was really special there was a church that really was very generous to us they showered us with Christmas presents one year because she was saying mom didn't have money for Christmas presents these people gave me my first black Barbie doll never had a black Barbie doll till then they invited us over to Thanksgiving with one of the families and the pastor's daughter she would babysit us my sister and I and this church just really just loved us it was great until it wasn't everything was great until as they were discipling my mother and introducing her to different aspects of following Jesus that there was a conversation that happened I don't really know because I wasn't there you see the pastor's daughter she had a waterbed and so my sister and I we used to play on the waterbed because Waterbeds were a thing and all I knew is you know if they came together as my sister my mom came and she said all right girls we're leaving something was a little bit off usually when we left even if my sister and I were fighting kind of left in like a good mood you know but there was something about my mom she just was not happy so we get in the car and we kind of like what's going on what's Happening and um see here's the thing they were trying to tell my mom about following Jesus and encouraging her to dive into her faith and I remember this conversation we had about how we're no longer going because they wanted her to stop working on Sundays the audacity see being a single mom and a waitress the idea of taking one day off it really was outlandish to her she literally couldn't afford to and I remember she said this to us she said how could a good god ask something so outrageous of me it reminds me of you know how often little kids they fight back when it's like nap time or bedtime like all right time to go to bed because your body needs it they come downstairs I just say water I'm so thirsty I'm hungry I haven't eaten in two minutes are they coming downstairs like look what I can do right like they just do not want to go to sleep but as caregivers we love them enough to give them rest and it was so interesting to me to have these two experiences last Sunday where I got to take a Sabbath that was so stinking good and my mom who was presented with this idea that seems terrible cruel evil even right you see the reality is that in life we are tired and the idea of rest can sometimes be appalling now how often in life do we find ourselves with just no more time left right between drop-offs and Pickups get-togethers family gatherings working late extra shifts side hustles door Dash meal preps walking your dog feeding your fish doing your laundry bathing yourself or your kids or your pets or your car counseling appointments doctor's appointments adjusting your medication budgeting volunteering family commitments friend commitments work commitments sleeping and for many of you that's just a couple days right life is so busy and only seems to get busier a few years ago I was a kid's pastor we had this kid come into church and I said hey it's so good to see you what's going on he said pastor Fisher I'm tired oh really so I haven't been here because I just am so busy like you're like eight years old how busy can you be right he goes on to tell me about all these things that he's got going on his life he's just too busy to come to church do you realize what a sacrifice it is for him to be here that one Sunday it's a man his entire child and you see it's funny because even as kids it feels like kids don't have enough time even kids these days are tired but you grow up and you're like okay it's gonna get better it's going to get better you go to high school and then all of a sudden you have no more time again she's even more tired and then you go to college or into the workforce you're going on with your life and just life doesn't ever seem to stop does it we are tired people there's a phrase I hear myself say over and over and over again maybe you've said this yourself if I had more time I'd well I can't I just don't have the time as a society we are tired see America runs on Duncan for a reason because we are tired three weeks ago I stopped drinking caffeine and you guys I'm tired but here's the thing one of the encouragements that we're given in the Bible is found in Galatians chapter 6 verse 9 it says this so let's not get tired of doing what is good at just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up now reaping blessing sounds great but the let's not get tired that sounds hard right how how do we not get tired of doing good when life has so many pressures on us how do we not get tired a few years ago I helped launch this new initiative to connect and equip women pastors it was so much fun I had a great time loved creating new things new ideas throwing in new ideas trying new things was awesome a year later we had built this organization and the next leg would be really to maintain what have been built and further develop the Ministries I realized that with the time I had I really wasn't going to be the most effective team member for this particular part of the journey and so I remember processing this with someone and they responded with why can't you now this is before I was married before I had kids in the house and all those things but they said you know you're single you have no kids when I was your age I thought 11 people talk to you like that when I was your age I had kids I was married I would have killed to have the time you have you guys I didn't just laugh I guffawed do you know gafar like it's an absurd laugh I was like what are you talking about see I was busy then and I'm busy now and for me when I'm not careful this busyness leads to exhaustion to bitterness resentment burnout depression anxiety overwhelm not so gentle parenting or partnering for diet and lack of physical health all the things and I was anyone else here sick and tired of being sick and tired but what if you didn't have to be you see the good news is that in all of the busyness of society today God offers us a great gift he wants to give you rest so Pastor Kurt's away he left us to preach through the Book of Genesis which for those of you who don't know is a really complicated book of the Bible and I decided I'm going to preach on creation which is not any less complicated than the rest but I'm gonna take it easy and I'm gonna preach about the end so in Genesis chapter 2 verses 1 through 31 if someone can just grab me a cup of water that'd be great it says this so the creation of the heavens and the Earth and everything in them was completed on the seventh day God had finished his work in creation so he rested can you guys say so he rested so he rested from all his work and God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy because it was the day from when he rested from all his work of creation you see God wonderfully and Incredibly lays out the galaxies Wildlife oceans and rivers vegetation fruits and vegetables all so good and he prepares it for us then as he creates he creates mankind the Masterpiece of his creation he goes on to create one last thing rest can you guys say rest you like that let's have a get my water in but he creates rest this is not just rest as in a power nap or like time to numb your brain but it's actually a whole live long day to do what rest in this day would be special sacred holy that means set apart when something is Holy it is set apart for a specific use not to be confused or into mixed with other things so our kids and Junior highers just got back from summer camp I don't know if you know that at first I just want to commend Pastor Jesse our youth pastor and Jess our kids director they made it possible for our kids to have a fantastic time and they are teams that were back when they were at Camp they had teams that were here on Wednesday night holding on the four you guys did a great job as well you see the kids got to have a good time because the leaders they work their butts off right so a few years ago I had brought a group of kids to camp and you know I brought all of my toiletries as one does I had brought my Razor but when I would leave the room I would store it in a case under my pillow it's kind of weird but I was really afraid of what would happen if like the kids were in the room and I wasn't there and they found it I don't know I was just freaking out so I would just hide it under my pillow so one day we get back to the room I went to go put it away but when I looked at it I realized there was something different about this razor there was hair on it and it wasn't mine and you see what happened was I was in the middle of New Hampshire we weren't allowed to leave the campground I'm there with the kids we're gonna have it we're at the beach it's in the middle of summer and my Razor has somebody else's hair on it yeah I had no option and none of the girls in my room would fess up I took those kids one at a time and I asked them what were we doing today when'd you go in the room did you find anything interesting you know they're kids like I don't know maybe they're just getting ready and they're not allowed to I don't know but each one of these kids lied to my face I was like dang I'm glad you guys are here at church camp you need Jesus this kid's lying so you know all I'm like thinking like these kids Little Liars playing games Little Liars who took my Razor so you know we eat dinner we go to nighttime Chapel they show like a little recap video of the day we're watching it laughing blah blah blah and I'm watching this video and I see this man grown man in our room on my bed pillow moves sees my Razor and I will give it to him it was weird why is there a razor under a pillow that is weird but what he did I think was weirder you see he took my Razor no lotion no shaving cream soap and dry shaved his leg I don't know why homeboy did that why you got to do that no one made him do it no one paid him to do it but he did with my Razor and listen there are a lot of things I'm really cool with sharing maybe some people are cool with sharing personal hygiene products I am not to me those items were to be used by one person and for one reason in the same way God created the Sabbath day and he made it to be set apart special day different from all the rest it would be holy and dedicated to God but how was the state to be different from the other days every other day of the week in Genesis chapter 2 verse 2 it says this God finished his work my glasses aren't that good God finished his work so he rested he stopped to it means to abstain from cease from or give up exertion or hard work doesn't that sound nice that sounds so lovely it's one whole day to stop working you see God wants more for you than for you to live your life overextended and exhausted the Bible is filled with God's reminding us and you're bringing us calling us back to him calling us to arrest because we were made to be more than just tired and do you know that you can accept his rest in Mark chapter 2 verse 27 Jesus said to them the Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath this is a gift for us a gift a good gift from our good God my mom felt like it was cruel unusual because how in the world would god require that of her but would she failed to see at that time was that God was actually not trying to punish her but was trying to help her to give her some sustenance in her life right now it can be really easy to be get caught up in the letter of the law sometimes if you've ever been on the Orthodox Jewish side of tick tock I don't know if you found yourself there um but you can look it up on YouTube and all those things there are some ways that people take the Sabbath to the extreme there's actually certain like appliances and all these things that were created so that people don't have to actually work it's kind of like funny little workarounds but one example is they have a Sabbath elevator what a Sabbath elevator does is it just it runs continually and stops at each floor so that way no one has to work you just step on the elevator you don't have to push a button right they have refrigerators and ovens all these things that are created to work they have this one Contraption that's like a lamp they open and shut it so they're not technically turning on the light it's just covering the light like we don't but here's the thing Jesus isn't calling us to a place of further bondage you see in Mark chapter 2 verse 23 to 28 says one Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grain Fields his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat they're hungry but that is Pharisees said to Jesus look why are they breaking the law by harvesting Grain on the Sabbath Jesus said to them haven't you ever read in the scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry he went into the house of God during the days of this guy the high priest and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests were allowed to eat he also gave some to his companions and Jesus said to them the Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath so that the son of man is Lord even over the Sabbath Jesus isn't calling us to a place of further bondage Jesus is inviting us to a place of rest he is inviting us into a place of rest so we have everything we need to continue doing what we need to do the rest of the week and to do so if we are honest is an act of great faith because in order to have one day off that means you have to work a little extra harder the rest of the six days don't you and on top of that you have to trust that it is God who will take care of you you have to rest this is really hard for me to say you have to be able to have faith in God because you have to trust in the fact you have to rest in the fact that you are a limited being with limited energy and limited resources and that means that not everything you want to accomplish is going to get accomplished and you have to trust that that is okay but what if you let God meet you in your limitations what if you trust him with your rest because you were not created to live tired I want to say that to you again you were not created to live tired my husband had told me about a couple of people at his job who they spend their whole life working they retire have a retirement party and then they die and it's this great tragedy if you think that your whole life begins once you retire right but if we live our lives in such a way that we are resting enjoying our lives we are not exhausted all the time is that really a waste of a life see God has a life of freedom for you and rest is a vital part of that can I tell you friends that you are free to not be exhausted a few weeks ago I you know I'm an extrovert and so when I'm hanging out with people I could just keep going and going and going and going some of you guys like can't relate respect that so I'm going having a great day then you know my family they're headed out somewhere and I said you know what I'm gonna do I'ma go to the beach I'm gonna go to the beach with everyone I can find we're gonna have a party at the beach like this is what my brain thinks right so I'm at home getting ready packing everything up I'm texting people you meet me at the beach let's go to the beach let's go to the beach and then I'm like I I think I'm tired the more time I spend away from people I started to realize my extrovertedness my energy was no longer coming from being around other people and I said you know what guys I know I just told y'all be going to the beach I ain't going today and that's why actually that's why I went to the beach um last Sunday was because I realized I needed to rest and sometimes it's just like that right see God wants to give us freedom he wants to give us rest but I have found that similarly to tithing the spiritual habit of rest is one that can be built upon if right now you hear the idea of taking a whole day off and you're like absolutely not you don't know my calendar looks like I respect that because I've been there before but if you have no space in your life to stop for a full 24 hours what would it look like if you were to just take one time block perhaps one hour or half a day and to begin to build your life around this space you see a few years ago I found myself really burnt out I was exhausted depleted empty you know it was one of those seasons in my life where I was always feeling like I just need a vacation and you know you know you've gotten to the end of yourself and a coma starts to sound real good just a few days off to get sick time I don't know but I had gotten there because I wasn't honoring God or myself and how I had toiled I didn't feel like I could take a Sabbath often because there was just so much work that needed to be done I had some you know you guys may have mentors in your life you have some mentors who are really nice encouragers you're doing great keep it up and then you have some mentors I have one Mentor she was not that kind of Mentor she was a get your act together kind of mentor so I'm telling her oh my gosh I'm so tired I'm exhausted I just can't get it I'm just gonna you know I have only a few more days till I get to Vacation come on I just can do it you know and I'm just like honestly complaining to her and sharing with her this burden of exhaustion I was carrying and she looked at me she asked me call me out on this one major thing I was missing in my life Sabbath rest and she asked when was the last time you took a Sabbath and so I get a day off every week don't worry about I get a day off every week she goes tell me about your last day off well I had to do laundry I had to do this I had to balance my finances and then I had to go this place I had to do this this this goes so that doesn't sound like a Sabbath tell me when's the last time you had a Sabbath and I began to think and I was like man I don't know the last day the last time I actually just stopped and she challenged me to guard my Sabbath and shared with me something I want to share to you guys with you guys today I'm going to invite the worshiping team to come on up there is a pastor named Pete cazero he's incredible he wrote a book called emotionally healthy spirituality a whole emotionally healthy Church emotionally healthy whatever you could think of probably has an emotional healthy version of it but um in this book he has an outline for what a Sabbath is because for maybe for you for me when I hear the word Sabbath I just think okay I just stop I go to church on Sunday is that it one of the ways that we can begin to invest in our lives and invest in our rest is through navigating these four parts of Sabbath the first part is to stop this means that you cease all work can you say all work all work some of you guys are hyperventilating like this is all work paid and unpaid you have to embrace your limits that is the hardest thing for me to admit we have to let go of the illusion that we're indispensable to the running of this world and recognize that you will never finish all your goals and projects and trust God to be God that if you start something that God can assist you with it as well the second part is rest you guys say rest we need to accept God's invitation to rest now resting is a matter of engaging in activities that restore you and replenish you how many of you guys some people know that resting looks different from person to person for some people rest me and sitting down with a good book for some people rest means going to the gym for some people recipes a lot of different things right and I put a little hammock on there because for me recipe it's a good day laying in my hammock get my little doggy get in my hammock it's a good day that's a rest for me but what for you if I could look I could look like napping or hiking reading eating good food yes cheese Hobbies Sports uh the third part of rest is Delight in Genesis 1 31 when God finished his work he said this is very good it is very good last Sunday when I had my Sabbath man I just all day just feel like this is very good the idea of delight is a joyful recognition and celebration of accomplishment God wants to invite you to join in the celebration and enjoy and Delight in his Creation in all the gifts he offers us in it the last part is to contemplate in Exodus chapter 31 verse 15 it says you have six days each week for your ordinary work but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest can you guys say complete rest of complete rest a holy dedicated to the Lord in Genesis 2 verse 3 it says and God bless the seventh day and declared it holy this is the difference between taking a day off and having a Sabbath you see a Sabbath is intended to be a holy day separate to God and when we contemplate or keep our focus on Jesus that's what makes it holy this is why traditionally on Sundays when people observe the sabbath there are other churches people might do on Saturdays but the idea of a Sabbath isn't locked into a specific day of the week but more a practice of Our Lives so this is why we come to church on Sunday we get to celebrate worship God together I love looking around and seeing everybody lifting their hands experiencing the love of God as one of the greatest ways for me to contemplate God in my life we used to say to disconnect from the toil of life and connect to God it's a spiritually recharge us so we're able to carry the weight of the work the rest of the week now a few years ago I went hiking with my friends well she decided to go hiking I just wanted to hang out and she decided we're gonna hike a mountain don't have friends like this but we got everything together we go to hike the mountain and for me I didn't grow up doing things like this I am not like an outside person so I really like to make sure that when we go I got a fully charged phone right because I need to know at any time I see a bear 9-1-1 I fall down 9-1-1 something happens nine I gotta be ready and so we're heading up this mountain and my phone I realized the battery just starts dying it just slowly going down right I'm like you know what I got a backup charger I told you I'm not an outside person I came prepared so I get my backup charger and my battery I got the charger I plug it in and I realized I had the charger I had was one of those wonky charger Chargers you ever have one like that you gotta like position it just right you can't breathe too heavy like just to get it to like charge your phone I'm like dang that's crazy and you see sometimes in life like we're kind of like just like that wonky little charger we're having a hard time getting fully refreshed but when we come when we use Sundays or a Sabbath to stop to rest delight and contemplate it's like having a fresh new long coil charger that charges it right up nice and fast you can breathe all you want and don't have to worry about it right but this is meant to spiritually recharge us because God doesn't want us to live tired he doesn't want you to live your whole life exhausted now you I want to let you know that you don't have to listen to the voice of the enemy or the world the traps of the world that would lie to you and say be tired keep working don't give up you can't you can't stop you just got to keep going that is a Lie from Satan so I was gonna say something else you don't have to buy into the lies you can accept God's rest and learn to and develop this in your life so friends would you stand with me this morning As we sing this last song I want to invite you to use this time that we have right now to enjoy some of these celebration of Sabbath moments that you would rest today you would Delight you would stop and you would contemplate who God is so accept this invitation to God's rest and trust in God As we sing this last song thank you", "all think skull that I'm broke dead flat Stony broke see I got $385 cents in my purse I literally just checked my bank account I am so broke and I don't know what I'm doing with my life and I just paid for more gas only $10 that's a lot of money come on my check better not be sh it's Friday and I'm broke my check better not it's Friday and I'm broke it's Friday and I'm broke it's Friday and I'm broke it's Friday and I'm broke my check don't come till next week my check better not be my check don't come till next week my check better not be all right go Elmo Elmo all right oh thank you Elmo uh anybody ever been broke you ever been broke you know sometimes I wonder how broke people been like have you been Have you ever been so broke that you put your car in a neutral going down Hills so it didn't use as much gas broke you haven't been broke unless you've done that you understand or pretend to be working on your health by riding your bike to work because you couldn't afford to get your car fixed broke well that's a good broke or you you sneak into a reception and you stash a few extra carrots and sweets because uh you don't got any food in the fridge kind of broke or this you know you're broke if you go to church and you steal toilet paper because uh you can't afford to buy any on your own not going to say that's happened a couple of times but it's happened a couple of times you know you're broke if you're stealing toilet paper at church all right that's broke that's extra broke that's like that's legendary status of broke right there um that's also a good uh dating question uh as you're just like can you like do you steal toilet paper regularly you know that that would be a good you need to know that answer that question um all right we've all been broke some people well not everybody but a lot of people have been broke and some of you might be broke right now or extra broke right now uh we're starting a a new sermon series just three weeks uh on um uh called broke called broke and so I'm going to show you a chart right well no before I show this go back to that screen I forgot I forgot here we go I love that that's Pastor Jesse's account from this morning right there the uh so so yeah he show me give me a graphic just pops it right up there he's he's told me that's not true all right and let me show you a chart now now here's a chart that looks kind of like um a uh almost looks like a a Wall Street like a the stock market uh chart and kind of up and down and you see there's kind of Middle High Point there and then it crashes you know what that is that's the pandemic right just P you know that's March 2020 and then boom just drops off plummets and goes storing back right so it's like the uh the the stock market the ch here though is that is not the stock market chart that is a chart of credit card debt in the United States okay I'm GNA walk you through this so credit card debt you can see was going L like that right we're we're going into more and more debt in America credit card debt lots of debt we get to the middle part there the high point and that is at the end of 2019 the end of 2019 American credit card debt was $927 billion then daring you know that's a lot just so you know that's insane that we don't have enough people in this country for us to legitimately need to have $927 billion dollar in credit card debt but we do in 2019 then during the pandemic when wheels of the bus were falling off in the world and everything was going crazy and and you know people getting free money and the mail that kind of stuff so all of a sudden people decided maybe I should pay off some debt and so for a minute for a minute we decided to be a little bit better with money than we were before and we started paying off debt and by March of 2021 we were down to $770 billion in debt still insane but a lot better than 927 then at the end of March 2021 something happened we all collectively apparently lost our minds and decided we don't want to be financially wise at all we're just going to go for it and boom and so at the end of last quarter we're now at1 trilli 31 billion in credit card debt in America it's the first time in history that we cross that one trillion Mark but look what the direction it's going it's basically $1 trillion and straight up like that like we're a couple years away we're going to be at$ two trillion dollar in credit card debt that's Insanity the reason that people feel so broke right now is that we have as a culture decided to live far beyond what we can actually afford far beyond what we earn we're living past it we owe a thousand billion dollars we owe a million million dollars that I can't you can't even figure out how much money that is that's so much money all right now the reason this is happening in part because other than just that we are all sinners is that uh we are surrounded in an economy in a world system that is trying to keep you broke the system actually is intentionally trying to keep you in this broke space I'm not like trying to you know put out conspiracy theories here this is just the way the system works this space of indebtedness is intended it's intended to trap people and it results in financial slavery and depression debt is nothing short of financial slavery today we start a three-week series called broke and we're going to be identifying some biblical principles to getting unbroke all right so that's where we're heading here we're going to try to help you get unbroke now why why are we talking about this on a Sunday morning well this is part of our mission you know in our core Mission we exist to preach good news to the poor bring healing to the broken freedom to the captives and justice for the oppressed this is part of that these truths that we're going to knock out over the next few weeks will bring healing to your brokeness it'll give opportunity for Financial Freedom being set free from captivity and release economic Justice in your life and that is all part of good news for the poor that is part of it so before you start to think of this as a just another Ted talk or something like a financial Ted Talk I want to make sure you don't get this messed up this is really a spiritual a deeply spiritual moment because money talk is always spiritual talk tell your neighbor money talk is spiritual talk now money talk is always spiritual talk because of this the talk about money is either spiritually negative or spiritually positive spiritually negative or spiritually positive and the reason that it's always either negative or positive is because even though people will say I've heard it said by a lot of people that money is neutral well it's not quite accurate money isn't really neutral because what people are trying to say is that what you do with money is what makes it good or bad what you do with money is what gives it power or not well money is not static ever meaning money is always working it always works for you or it always works against you and so if you're like well I just won't do anything with money I'll just put the $100,000 that I got or $5,000 or $6 whatever it is and you put it under your pillow by next week it's worth less than it was today because of something called inflation so it's always working for you or against you it's always doing something positive or something negative it's not like a stick in the woods if you're walking through the woods and there's like sticks laying around it's like how does that impact you right it's kind of neutral right this the stick in the woods well if you snap your leg and you need to put a splint on your leg in order to get out of the woods you can take that stick and you can make it positive it will help you or if you're walking through the woods and uh you see somebody you don't like and you take the stick and you beat them with it that would be negative right so but the stick itself is not it's actually static it's just sitting there it's neither doing good or bad not quite that way with money there's more power with with money so today we're going to jump ahead and start talking about four choices to live a financially blessed life four choices to live a financially blessed life we'll cover two of them today and a couple of them next week now the reason we're talking about this is because I would never want you to live a financially unblessed life am nobody ever signs up for that class living a financially unblessed life sign up here right like that's that's not a thing that people want however there's a group of spiritual sounding people that very much want us to not talk about financial blessings and they want us not to talk about it because there have been people that have gone too far there have been people that have done weird stuff with it and we're not going that far we're not being weird with it I want you to know this that the Bible does in fact want you to be financially blessed because the Bible has principles in it that talk about over 2,000 times the Bible speaks to financial well-being or Financial Health the Bible talks about lots of things like spiritual health physical health relational Health mental health it talks about all of that it even talks about Financial Health and well-being so as we get going with this there's a couple of ground rules one of them is we never wholeheartedly pursue money that's not the point of life the point of life is to wholeheartedly pursue God now part of wholeheartedly pursuing God is having Financial Health that is in fact part of it because to pursue god with full abandoned inside the context of an economically corrupted world we must learn to live with a rhythm of Financial Health in our lives we must learn to walk in financial blessing and to be Financial financially blessed that's a very real real thing for us Martin Luther you know 500 years ago he said there's three conversions that everybody has to have the first is the conversion of your heart then there's the conversion of your mind and then there is the conversion of your purse or your wallet or your bank account our theme verse today comes from Proverbs chap 11 it says when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of Joy why would the city rejoice when the righteous prosper just think about this why does the city Rejoice why would the city rejoice when the righteous Prosper because when righteous people Prosper they are a blessing to those around them amen when Wicked people prosper and they do when Wicked people Prosper they take advantage and exploit those around them amen it's not doesn't become a blessing it become they double down on the exploitation verse 11 says through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed so the city benefits when we Prosper when you are righteous and you prosper the city benefits and they can uh it could be a blessing so let's ask this clarifying question that you're just going to do do you want to be financially blessed amen like it's it's yes or no I don't know if there's a maybe there just do I want to be financially blessed yes or no you know not a lot of people say no to that some might but I don't I don't know those people very often most people want to be financially blessed but the follow-up question is this what do you want to be financially blessed for an important the answer to that question is the point what do you want to be financially blessed for see I want you to be financially blessed because I believe that God wants you to be financially blessed he doesn't want you to be financially cursed he doesn't want you to be financially unblessed wants you to be blessed so that you can be a blessing so that we can be a blessing where we are at so four choices to learn in the scripture and how to live a financially Blessed Life Point number one choose hustle over hoping choose hustle over hoping but I what I mean let me Define hustle just for today because there's multiple definitions but hustle is just like work okay it's good it's work some people don't like to work let's just be honest some people don't like to work they don't want to work they make excuses for why they shouldn't have to work because they got no hustle in them except for hustling the government maybe but they just don't want to they don't want to work let me tell you something work has existed from the very beginning before sin people sometimes think that work is about because people are sinning work was before sin before sin or the end of the world Adam and Eve had jobs they were working they weren't just hanging out eating grapes right they were doing stuff we will even work in Heaven There Will Be things for us to do we were built to work to create to build and when you don't work or when we don't work we lose part of the rhythm of what it means to live a healthy life and so the thing there are things that work does with that are good for us that we don't get to have if we don't do it even amongst Christians there are some unfortunate ideas that sometimes creep in and people think something sounds spiritual but in fact it's deeply problematic these are Wish Upon a Star Christians the the the people that are just waiting like a like a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by her Disney Prince Charming right like it's kind of like we have a whole group of Christians out there that live their life this way like kind of wishing and hoping for the right person to find me or wishing and hoping for my new car or wishing and hoping for my loans to just magically be paid off or or wishing but not working towards it the deeply spiritual principle would be to pray hope and work towards it see we are built and designed to work we pray pray and we work we pray and we hustle we pray and then we advance we pray then we level up we pray and then we skill set up that's all part of what this means to be financially blessed is we choose hustle over hoping for the last 22 years in the city we have people from our church that work in nearly every sector or business in the city in the region in the city and when I'm out in the community and I meet an employer or a supervis visor or a boss and they find out that I'm the pastor here at this church it's a high compliment when they say wow that's awesome because the employees we have from East Coast International Church are the best ones we have am now when they say that it's a high honor and compliment to your faith and to our church it would be horrible if they said man can you talk to your people that that that that would be different conversation um 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 says this even while we were with you we gave you this command those unwilling to work will not get to eat it's said but it's said if you're able to work you must work because there's a principle here that's the choice to hustle that's the choice to get out there and do it so if you want to take an action step here then here it is work hard Proverbs Chapter 14 says all work all hard work brings a profit but mere talk leads only to Poverty Proverbs 12 says work hard and become a leader be lazy become a slave and I don't want to be a slave so work hard Colossians 3 and this kind of brings it home on this point Colossians 3:23 work willingly at whatever you do as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people listen I know some of us have jobs some of you are working at a job that you do not like you don't like some of the people you don't like all the stuff that you do it makes you tired or exhausted or it's just frustrating or boring or you know whatever whatever those things happen to be let me help you with this sure you're allowed to go find another job that's all fine too but as when you're working work as though you were working for God himself that you were working for Jesus rather than for people because you are that's the point you're working for Jesus so take pride in your work do it with integrity and generosity and compassion this is really critical because when we do this kind of work it is a an example to those around us God also uses it to bless us financially so that's the first choice choose over hoping the second is to live a financially choice you need to make to live a financially blessed life is to choose a plan over a passion choose a plan over passion you know like everybody wants to to live their passion now follow their passion now you know just what this generation says we what it really means is that we are now as society and we've been it for a while that has elevated the role of the feelings in our life as the highest value feelings have become the highest value of everything people want to know how you feel it's fine nothing wrong with that but where it shifts is it goes from being aware of our feelings to prioritizing them as the highest value in our life if it makes me feel good and since that's feeling is the highest priority then it's okay if it makes me feel good it's okay here's the problem with this faulty thinking it leads to debt captivity when you choose your passion over a plan when you choose your feelings over a plan it leads to debt captivity which is just a nice way to say Financial slavery sure that trip that you're going on next week that you can't afford will be so awesome right if you happen to be going on a trip next week I don't know that I just made that up okay it was so awesome it's or maybe you went someplace and it was so great but you have all this debt and you went into debt on it and now you are in over your head with debt because you actually didn't have a plan a financial plan on how to take that trip you chose your feelings or your passion or or whatever over your plan and now you're in financial trouble listen that outfit that made you feel so good I mean you put it on and you felt confident and in charge and powerful and it was great and it was very expensive I me you got the whole thing it's amaz you know what you might have felt good when you walked out of the store but MasterCard and Visa felt a lot better than you did all right and that and they will continue to feel really good by the time you realize the trouble you're in amen I'm not saying don't go on vacations or I'm not saying don't buy stuff I'm saying have a plan have a plan you see at this point in my life I'm 53 years old I know shocking but true um at this point in my life I can pretty much do whatever I want financially I can go where I want can buy what I want but when we decide that we're going to do something we have a plan first so we will create the financial opportunity and in order for us to do the thing that we want to do and so the plan makes sure that there's no debt created no giving is interrupted and no goals are derailed well I get to do that at 53 now because Jen and I have been making financially wise choices for a really really really really really really long time and so over time you get there but can I tell you something I'm just gonna tell you just be honest with you it's much it's very nice being on this side of it it is there is a freedom that is very very nice and but it's because we've we're living in financial blessing because we have made these choices along the way so make the plan choose the plan over the passion and then eventually you'll get to the passion side Luke chapter 14 Jesus said this don't begin until you count the cost somebody tell your neighbor count the cost for who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there's enough money to finish it otherwise you might compete complete only the foundation before running out of money then everyone would laugh at you Jesus is very concerned about people laughing at you so you're counting the cost whatever it is you got something you want to do you got something you're going for you count the cost can I actually do it am do I have a plan to do it thinking about uh what you are going to spend instead of just spending it and what it will cost you these are actually spiritual decisions they might feel practical they might feel just Financial they are deeply spiritual decisions that we are making so the action step here is super romantic the action step here is get on a budget all right that's the act now if you don't like the word budget that's okay you don't have to like the word budget you still need to be on a budget but there's a whole part of the financial literacy industry that's come up that has stopped using the word budgeting they're like you don't the clickbait is you don't need to budget and so they'll tell you how to automate your finances which is called budgeting all right so it's all it's a form of budgeting okay no matter how you got to have a plan you got to have a budget you got to think through it you got to figure out where your money is coming from and where your money is going and where you eventually want it to be going and what you need to do so that's that's very real on the screen if you have never delved into the space of like figuring out your finances or or trying to live a financially blessed life on the screen we have the the rookies only this is just for rookies okay so if you've never done it before here's your here's your thing it's called the 10180 plan where you give 10% to God which is uh scripturally uh uh a challenge in scripture to do then 10% for your future that's like paying um uh like investing and like so maybe someday you can retire and then 80% for everything else that's this is just to get you going okay 10 1080 and it's just a it's an easy thing to remember but if you're kind of you've got this down now it's time to move on you're past rookie you're now like a senior and finances and uh you're moving forward it's 503020 which is 50 % is your Necessities that's like tithing giving housing Transportation Insurance the things that are like the requirements for you then the 30% is your wants that would be like travel and restaurants and entertainment or just whatever it is things that you want that Coach purse or something the uh and then the 20% that's debt elimination savings investing and things like that okay so it's 5030 20 um we're going to keep on moving a budget you have in order to pull this stuff off you have to have some type of a budget you have to have thought through things you make financial decisions um in advance of the moment if you have a plan and a budget your budget will tell you what to do so when you get into that situation where you want to spend certain amount of money that you're like I should not spend that money your budget will help you get out of that scenario you don't have a budget you'll be like I can figure it out next month and you you get yourself further in trouble so the budget helps you make decisions without emotion in the moment all right I'm going to call up Stacy Rogers Stacy why don't you come on up for a moment all right here we go got a m have a seat right over here I got a microphone for you all right hey Stacy hello good to see you again good to see you too um so Stacy tell everybody a little bit about yourself who are you all right I'm Stacy as you can see there um I moved to LY in 2016 and been coming to this church since then which is like eight years now I was like wow that's a long time um so yeah so I have been here since 2016 and work at Northshore Community College in Lyn right and we we we met before 20 we met before that we did yeah through a weird set of situations that's great circumstances um so it's great oh I forgot the important part tell me I have a cute adorable little two-year-old there we go single mom um adorable twoy old he's got the little fedora hat usually he's adorable he's so adorable he's my favorite the uh you're his favorite I know that's why he's my favorite Pastor Kurt he loves me um he he can tell I'm not scary Pastor Kirk though Kirk Kirk that's fine we'll get there listen I people people that have known me for 30 years that I I'll email them sign my name KK it's really clear they'll still say hey Pastor Kirk on the way back I don't know what's wrong with people uh some of you do that um so we've talked about Financial Freedom type stuff pretty much every year for the last 22 years it's true true I mean I don't know about the past 22 years but the past eight that I've been here yeah yeah so we we we have and we've had CL classes and series and what happens is people come out of these things and they're like oh that's good that's good information to have I know what to do actually even like I know the biblically where the biblical position is on this and all these kind of things but doing it is a different thing it is right right and so uh tell us I mean you've been around for a while tell us like how has this work for you like is like you hear like a message on something and then you just go home and like do it for like the next six years I wish yeah yeah yeah so you know I've been here eight years now and I've done a Financial Freedom class twice now I think um every time you're right it's the same thing it's like this is awesome I set a budget I'm keeping it going for a month or two maybe but then it all falls apart and I think that a big piece of that is because once you leave your group you're done with the class and it's just you it's it's hard you know it's funny you mention vacations nice outfits those are all things I've gone into debt over really so I was laughing because I was like how do you know it's because everybody goes into debt over the same things that's why it's not just you so uh what we've figured out well we think we figured it out we're hoping to have figured it out our financial literacy team here at the church uh said let's do something more than just a class let's turn it into some type of accountability situation so this past year we we had a class and then we immediately following the class started a cohort so tell so you're part of this financial cohort so tell us what that's all about yeah so like Pastor Kurt said we had a four-week class where we talked about budgeting we got spreadsheets um paper sheets tools that can help us Kickstart that but then that was the key is we didn't just go on our own and good luck to you all but we're sticking together and meeting um now once a month with the group there's six of us right now and we meet once a month on a Wednesday and we talk about our budget for the next month how did things go last month what are you budgeting for this month do you have any expenses coming up that you need help figuring out and talk it out with each other so it's really good to have that Collective Community you're not just on your own so it's more than just talking about it yes you guys have established a couple of goals we have okay tell us about that yeah we want to pay off um do you have the number of how much we said I think we said like $20,000 Maybe collectively as a group we want to pay off debt so we're trying to have a goal this is how much as a group we're going to pay off of our own individual debt and we all want to have a full emergency fund all right so the goal that the team cohort set the goal at say it's $20,000 the six of them are going to reduce their debt by $20,000 and all of them the goal is to get the emergency fund of $1,000 y because as we talked about a few months ago getting the first thousand in your emergency fund is the absolute hardest and keeping it there so what's that and keeping it there right right yeah and figuring out oh that's not act like snacks is not emergency fund right vacation is not emergency fun Disney World not emergency Disney World not emergency fund um right so figuring out all of that stuff is helpful so if you guys are talking about these numbers that must mean that you're telling each other stuff about your own personal finances we are and you know that was hard at first but after a few months now we're so comfortable with each other and knowing you know our situations and what debts we have what we're trying to take care of that you know we've really grown together as a community and group that we're comfortable sharing those things with one another so it is like on the front end there is a complete transparency on finances right yeah so just so you know I actually don't even know who's in the cohort I got I you had told me that you were in it that's why I knew you were but um like I have no idea like what people's financial situation is in there I just know that the group is Weare and it's talking and there's transparency about what my real debt situation is and what my real emergency fund and what I really spend my money on yep exactly so that matters just so you know if you're not willing to ever be naked or transparent about this stuff you're never going to make progress okay true so it's a it's critical so you need this kind of trusted environment and it has helped you it has helped you so so tell us where you've gone to so far in your in this few months so so far I do have the emergency fund fulfilled which was awesome yes yeah um good job and I'm able to like I said talked to my group like I had this thing I think it's emergency they're like not an emergency don't do it don't take the money keep it yeah um so I have an emergency fund and I have a goal for myself to pay off $5,000 of debt personally by the end of the year that's good good and I make good progress so far but it's only it's only January so and you're going to be out of credit card debt yes I'm gonna be paying off my last credit card at the end of the month so good my student loans that's another story I see you students over here I see you yeah student student loans right that's that's the uh that's next that's a whole another sermon series um right dare the so want you to catch this as a group so far the group has decreased debt by several thousand dollar and is uh increased emerc savings at the same time and and I will tell you this is different than what happens when people don't do a cohort it's very true people in the group have influenced me and we're influencing each other because of our decisions for example you know we had some people that are like I don't think I've ever had an emergency fund I don't have money to save and then you know buy things like I'm G to drink coffee at church instead of stopping at dunks on the way to church you got $5 your emergency fund right there there you go that's 20 bucks a month emergency fun fun that's funny yeah that's like the legal that's like the legal version of taking toilet paper from the bathroom right there is what that is that makes up for it you drink the coffee in your that is funny I love that okay I'm just I'm just marinating on that for a second right now I think about that um it's true every little sacrifice every little things we even talked about do you have things you could sell do you have kids clothes that they grown out of or toys that they don't play with that you could sell on Facebook Marketplace or whatever and have 50 bucks to put in your emergency fund it's great it's great uh you're making it making a ton of progress uh we're proud of you and and the group for doing this it's hard this is how this is how we we Achieve Financial Freedom yes is that we we we hold each other accountable on these things but you have to be willing to be held accountable on these things can I throw in what I said last service too you know one of the the main reasons why I wanted to join this group is because growing up my parents never really talked to me about money I didn't really know so when I turned 18 I went to you know American Eagle hoister whatever I don't you know is hoister even a thing anymore well hoister like I'm gonna buy that you just aged yourself right there did I Ed myself so go to Hollister like I'm gonna buy the pair of jeans you go up there would you like to save 20% by opening a credit card yeah I do I'm Gonna Save money okay housers give me free money that's not how it works that's right I didn't know but I suffered because you know I did that quite a few times and when I was in college and you want to talk about being broke college students that's that's tough but you know having to pay off tons of credit card debt on top of that is just insane so I mean I don't want my son and my family to go through those things so you know there's a saying if you know better do better so we can teach our children I know not all of you have children but we can teach the future Generations what it looks like to have good finances to be in a healthy Place great great thank you thank [Applause] you all right thank you Stacy so February 21st is our next financial uh class it's on Wednesdays at 7 starting February 21st you can sign up in the church Center app but that'll be followed up by another cohort okay and so the in it's not information is Never Enough it's knowledge is Never Enough it's the application of knowledge and so the cohort is to help us apply this and again this might not sound traditionally spiritual but it is deeply spiritual in nature and this this is absolutely part of it so February 21st 2024 worship team come on up if you would that would be great why doesn't everybody go ahead and stand at this time before we close just a couple of things things I want to make sure that you got Choice number one let's choose hustle over Hope Choice number two choose plan over passion let me let me make sure that you hear this if you thought you were the only one in the world that was in trouble financially it's not true a lot of people in fact the vast majority of people in America are in financial trouble vast majority I just want you to give yourself a break take a breather let go of the shame that's not what this is about this isn't like a beat yourself up kind of moment this is just a just a moment where you recognize reality and then you take the next step right that's just take the next step that's all you can do right now but don't don't live in shame don't uh don't go there it won't help and it'll actually actually harm in a situation so today as we close if there's uh the altars are on if you'd like to spend some time praying about this if there's very something very specific that you need to give over to God about this or maybe it's just the idea of inviting God into your financial life like somehow maybe You' just kept it separate maybe it's time to invite God into even your financial life here today so uh as the worship team can lead us from here", "[Applause] all right everybody good morning the um so so good to see you all today we uh that last uh little clip there that's actually a like a little invite video it's a little commercial it's actually on our uh social medias Facebook Instagram and stuff like that so what what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to uh go there sometime today or the next time you remember and go and and uh you can share it on your Instagram page or your however you do that you know on your socials and go ahead and share that with some friends uh this week it would be something great for you to be able to do now there's something I want to make sure that you are aware of um on your way out of the service today we have some invite cards some some just some information that you could share with family or friends or enemies that you would like to bring to church with you uh that would be great um the something that you need to be aware of is this um we've experienced a season uh in the middle of the summer and a time when most churches uh traditionally do this huge dip of attendance and programming and just a huge dip uh that has not happened uh this year uh uh we have experienced a we've actually experienced a really important season of growth throughout the summer and we are projecting that will continue to happen throughout September and uh another really important thing for you to know is this so uh if you've been around for a while uh pre pandemic um uh the church was much larger than it was was uh right after uh the pandemic and we are now here in Lynn we are now back to prepandemic attendance numbers this is a very important milestone for us as a church the reason I the reason I'm saying it is this uh we have been really like trying to get back to a place of of strength and health uh in in our in a lot of the areas and uh we really feel like that we are at that place now and so you will feel us do this we are putting the gas down we are going all the way in now again so you're going to feel us pushing a little bit harder you're going to feel us uh you're going to feel like oh what's happening here we're just pushing a little bit harder that's absolutely right uh and it's it started last week and so you're going to feel it you're going to feel it happening as well now at the same time that this that's happening you'll notice that in our services over over the last several weeks there has been something occurring there has been a shift of some kind uh a desperation a hunger a desire for God in a in a unique way and I I want you to pray with me about that uh in in the days ahead I don't make sure it's not just me praying about that please make sure that you're praying uh about that as well that that we see God at work amongst us and in our community setting captives free right we want to make sure that uh we are seeing God do all the things that God wants to do amongst us now um I want to show you a little bit uh of what's taking place up on the third up up up on the third and fourth floor so we're going to show you a quick little video and I'll talk you through it up on the fourth floor it used to be a wide open open space so you're not allowed to go up there because it's dangerous and so uh but this is what's happening up there right now it's just they're starting to build the units there's 12 uh apartments that are being built on the fourth floor 12 on the thir third floor along with two Community rooms one on each uh floor so they're being built it doesn't look particularly awesome yet it's just a bunch of studs and uh things happening right now so no because most of us are from Lynn um you can help me out with this uh it is for 18 to the housing is for 18 to 24 year old homeless uh uh young adults that's who it's for from ly okay that's who it's for but there are organizations across the city that have been giving applications to people to fill out that are not in that category so we've gotten tons of applications from like 50 and 40 and 60 year olds right so they're just literally wasting their time applying okay so we don't want that to happen um but but so if you're like thinking oh I'm one of the people that filled that out sorry uh but it's it's if you're not in that category and the reason is this if you're in that category 18 to 24 year old uh there is literally no housing for you anywhere doesn't exist so we we are fing a really important need this falls into the Justice wing of our church um and our our the the four major uh pillars of what we're focused on and so that we're just getting started in this Arena uh but it's a major major accomplishment for us and we are on track it should be finished by the end of March 2025 so let's continue to press forward with all of that all right all right lots of great stuff so we are moving forward with our tearing down stronghold series uh so far we've done a few things we've made a declaration that that the curse is broken we've learned a few practical steps like it's time to grow up we've uh talked about the sexiest word in the English language obey uh We've uh We've uh talked about the importance of repentance we've talked about and cashing the check that Jesus gives us and we've talked about renouncing those are the key key things that we've talked about so far today uh this lesson is a part of how uh to make sure that we don't slip back into bondage once we've been set free and how we stay out of the enemy's Camp how do we stay out of that bondage you see it really is My Heart's Greatest desire that you don't just get free but that you stay free yes that you walk in the full and Abundant Life that Jesus has for you all the days of your life yes you see I've seen far too many people find Freedom for five minutes and I'm really not interested in you finding freedom for five minutes I want you to find Freedom for a lifetime not just for Sunday morning but for all of your life and that's what we're talking about here tearing down strongholds for the rest of your life amen and so we we're we're we're bringing this out little by little by little is what we're doing here once uh after Jesus had been involved in a series of powerful teachings and life-changing Miracles and deliverances there were a group of religious leaders that that were jealous and they asked some annoying questions and said some of things about of Jesus and Jesus responded to them and he responded with this very interesting statement in Matthew chapter 12 he says when an evil spirit leaves a person it goes into the desert seeking rest but finding none then it says I will return to the person I came from so it returns and finds the former home empty swept in an order then the spirit finds seven other Spirits more evil than itself self and they all enter the person and live there and so that person is worse off than before that will be the experience of this evil generation so in case you don't have the context for memory of what's going on around this what's What's Happening Here is Jesus is teaching about empty religion okay he's teaching about empty religion that creates reformation and rules but entirely misses Jesus am so he's talking to the religious leaders and he's saying you do a really good job at uh cleaning house and setting up rules all right but that's it you don't have anything filling the space you miss me you're you're missing you're missing what you need most you're missing Jesus he's calling them out is what he's doing he's calling them out and saying hey you started well but you made a wrong turn and now things are actually worse than when you started amen it's a slap in the face is what it is um it's a rebuke to them it's a pretty serious rebuke the modern version of this uh this is what I think it is I think the modern version of this is people that become Christians that don't become followers of Jesus now I know that technically that's not possible right you have in order to be a Christian you have to become a follower of Jesus but there are millions if not billions of people that identify as Christians that don't follow Jesus that's terrifying and it's the verse it's the passage we just read they have become religious but have nothing filling the space they have no relationship with Jesus they seek salvation which sounds awesome but not the leadership of Christ and to fully experience the rescue of Jesus you need the salvation and the leadership of Christ it starts in the right direction but it ends up being worse than when you began and when we apply this to the space of tearing down strongholds and breaking curses you you can't engage in spiritual warfare and begin breaking curses and start renouncing things that keep you from God without the same time replacing those voids with his uh let you replace those voids with his presence his peace his power and his Spirit yeah you got to replace it with something you can't just leave it empty amen so the the steps that we are talking about in this series are living according to his spirit and his power and his presence and his peace that's that's what's going on here that's why we're talking about all these things so last week we spent quite a while talking about renouncing Sin okay but in that idea of renouncing sin the next thing is that you must also physically remove yourself somebody say remove you also have to physically remove yourself am it's not a really complicated Point everybody all right you got to physically remove yourself you know when Israel was set free from 400 years of Egyptian slavery you know what they had to do they had to leave Egypt yes they had to remove themselves from Egypt they didn't like leave slavery and stay in Egypt they left Egypt and sometimes you got to get this through your head said you've got to leave Egypt if you want to be free sometimes you have to evict the enemy from your life and sometimes you have to evict yourself from the enemy's Camp because if you don't evict yourself from the enemy's Camp you will begin to participate with the Enemy and do the things the enemy does this is not a complicated point it's pretty obvious and self-evidence but yet we struggle with it one time or the time Jesus Jesus was arrested there was this really tragic moment one of the more complicated moments in the Bible the Peter who would eventually become the leader of the church had a a difficult moment where he betrayed Jesus in Matthew chapter 26 it says meanwhile Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard this is right before he betrays Jesus and the reason this is important it says Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard what that means is Peter was someplace he was not supposed to be he wasn't with the other disciples he wasn't with the other fellows he was with the other side in other words he was in the enemy's Camp he was sitting outside in the courtyard a servant girl came over and said to him you were with one of those with Jesus the Galilean but Peter denied it in front of everyone I don't know what you're talking about he said this is the guy that's going to lead the church and he denies Jesus because he was in the wrong Camp he was someplace he wasn't supposed to be that's what happens when you don't remove yourself you see you have to remove yourself so that you are no longer in relationship with sin or its dealers amen see it's both amen it's not just the sin it's also sin's dealers it's like a former drug addict hanging out with their former drun dealer there's no longer a former if that happens all right when you renounce heroin and you renounce Fentanyl and you renounce marijuana yes marijuana it is assumed that you by default renounce the dealer because if you don't remove yourself from the dealer you're just lying to yourself and we all know it right amen speaking I guess you don't know it all right so just you do you need to know it now speaking forcefully might be fun about it but it doesn't accomplish anything unless there is some action because renouncing without walking away misses the point on renouncing is a spiritual Act of lacing up your War boots but those boots are made for walking and that's just what they're supposed to do right right right come on come on for real some somebody's got to help me Preach Today I even have my War boots on today right here see see see come on I I listened to the whole song yesterday to see if I could play it but I can't okay so that's going to be in the back of your mind yeah besides talking without walking is just using up oxygen and ain't nobody got time for that Proverbs CH 22 verse 24 says this don't befriend angry people if you lose a bunch of friends today sorry may have it may this might be wise so any don't befriend to angry people or associate with hot-tempered people or here's the point you will learn to be like them and endanger your soul so obviously there's a point here about hanging out with angry people but there's a another broad point which is this tremendous principle which is rebellious people are contagious rebellious people are contagious and they will will give you their disease like they are passing out candy okay they spiritually will cough all over you and give you their spiritual covid too soon on the co sorry too soon they will spiritually vomit on you they will rub up against you like a contagious person and you will catch their spiritual disease this is the point you have to remove yourself you know in today's world it's not just the physical piece we have this digital thing and you have to remove yourself that way as well from those digital enemies gamps so again how do we stay free when I went to Purdue University uh studying political science and Russian trying to be the uh next great politician or the first great politician the uh I was discovering my own spiritual identity I was surrounded by 40,000 of my favorite Heathen friends they were friendly heathens but as you can imagine when you're around a lot of heathen friends and you're exposed to lots of heathen stuff which we all are I think right they convinced me to go with them to this party that was this like late 80s crazy party like if you're as old as me you know what that means so they were they were so excited to get me to this this party they had a rookie and they were just going to Haze me right that's what was going to happen so we go to this house and it was like wall toall people loud music kind of like church okay loud but the altar was a row of Kegs and hard liquor I I literally walked in and I stood in wide-eyed confusion it was like a sociological experiment and it was nasty the floor was sticky spilled booze everywhere people were already passed out it was like a scene of a frat house movie basically there was just lots of Rapid drinking and drinking games and stories of how awesome it was to be the most drunk and whatever and it took me a while to realize what my response would be I remember thinking huh this is kind of stupid and the floor is sticky and thank God this is the next thought that went through my mind I'm 17 years old this next thought goes through my mind I don't want to live a sticky life and it was one of the most deeply spiritual thoughts I've ever had I left and I walked home I just evicted myself from the room and it cost me something I walked home seven miles and it was the end of those friendships it was a personal Declaration of my faith it was the immediate targeting of me as an outsider it was like I had a giant bullseye on my on my back but it took me removing myself from the situation to make an internal Declaration of Faith follow following that moment I removed myself from an entire group of unhealthy relationships and unhealthy job in an unhealthy roommate situation and then over the next 14 months after that moment eight of those friends separately and individually sought me out privately one after the other am and one by one they rehearsed stories that revealed the lies that the enemy was doing in their life and how the enemy was systematically destroying them lives and one by one they each surrendered their lives to [Music] Christ I want you to listen to this carefully when you remove yourself it won't always be fun at first in fact you will frequently be tormented for doing the right thing yes but the torment will dissipate and in that moment you will have fractured the stronghold that the enemy has and it will give the people that you love an opportunity to someday be rescued by Jesus maybe not right away but stay the course stay the course because they will be watching am they will be watching watching everything stay the course remove yourself am next you got to recreate true renewal in your life requires planning it requires effort and it requires practice continuously tending The Garden of your soul maybe it's each morning or each week or each month each year you establish systems of spiritual Recreation these are sabath moments or a Sabbath day a Sabbath getaways in the book of Exodus we see it says remember to observe the sabbath day by keeping it holy right we got the big 10 here you have six days each week for your ordinary work but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God so God here is establishing that that one day a week needs to be set aside as different it's what we call the Sabbath now it's it's been discussed and talked about uh for centuries but the core of it is it's a gift from God to us for us to have it a moment a day to be recreated every single week I've been in Ministry nearly my whole life uh if you don't know I grew up in a Ministry family and all around me throughout my entire life I have watched people go through difficult times I've watched people kind of implode on themselves I've watch leaders fall apart I've watched families fall apart I've watched all kinds of crazy and unfortunate things I've also seen lots of good things but there's a common thing that occurs uh with things people and families that fall apart one common thing it's a lack of attention to to the Sabbath principle of recreation and renewal there's just a complete abandonment of the idea that I need to take time to be spiritually renewed spiritually recreated I've noticed this I've been in Ministry for formal Ministry for over 33 years am and I feel more recharged today than I was 33 years ago amen I I know I look it as well the uh I'm not tired I just have sinty eyes they um I really I I'm more excited about Ministry I'm more I'm more refreshed today than I've ever been thank God Hallelujah because for 33 years I have carved out room every week for a Sabbath day amen and I allow the opportunity in my life for God to recreate and restore and replenish my spirit it's a gift to me it's not a have to it's a get to Exodus 16:23 he told them this is what the Lord commanded tomorrow will be a day of complete rest a holy Sabbath day set apart for the Lord verse 29 they must realize that the Sabbath is the Lord's gift to you hallelujah it's a gift now for most of you uh each Sunday should function for you as a Sabbath but I want to make sure I say this uh there's nothing in the Bible that gives us any indication that we should be hyper legalist about this in fact for people that are super legalistic about this they are really just completely misunderstanding the point it's a gift okay but there are there are things uh in our culture that that help us to understand that Sunday is a set aside day amen but the Sabbath day is a day of rest a day of worship these are the things that you need to incorporate a day of rest a day of worship and a day of purposeful fulfillment of your calling these are things that would you incorporate into a Sabbath a recreating moment you can also have Sabbath moments which are times of scripture and time in individual prayer times with individual worship not just corporate but then there's something else that I would call Sabbath getaways and this might be a new idea for you this would be where you intentionally get away for a day or a couple of days maybe once a year just by yourself maybe you a Bible and a notebook and it's a place where you can shut off the technology get away from humans maybe that's the mountains or if you hate mountains you know whatever it happens to be for you a place where you can get transparent with God just you and God where you can get completely and totally naked before God not actually naked all right that would be awkward especially for God right right so just just transparent is what I'm trying to say completely and totally vulnerable before God you have to have these moments where you let your guard down for Real where you let your guard down with God you know trust is something that comes naturally to us these days isn't it we don't love to trust anyone and it takes us a little bit of time to be unguarded even unguarded with God but 10 unguarded minutes with God will change you from deep within and 10 unguarded hours with God can change your destiny and on the flip side of that friends 10 unguarded minutes with the devil can destroy a relationship and 10 unguarded hours of the devil can destroy your hopes your dreams and your future see how that works Recreation and renewal have an intentionality about them you don't get renewed in front of a TV or on the Internet or shopping or these things that we lie to ourselves about it takes intentionality to be recreated and renewed there are all kinds of different Sabbath getaways I I have done several in my life that have been spiritually transformative and there may be others that worked for you but these have worked for me I've done uh Gone Away by myself for a day or two on silent Retreats that are really helpful for me and beneficial for me I've I've gone away for an entire week on a long solo prayer Retreat like to the end of the world where nobody could find me I've gone with my wife on short spiritual uh Retreat just for a couple of days I've gone on spiritual pilgrimages amen those things don't just happen you don't have to plan and prepare spiritual pilgrimage to Israel have gone twice to walk in the land of the Bible has left a mark of my soul I I think about it almost every day to stand where Christ was crucified to walk where he was resurrected to sit in the prison where he was held the night before his crucifixion to walk on the hill where he preached to the masses it it just hits you it lives with you in a different way and it's deeply recreating and renewing then last year Jen and I took six weeks together to to rest and renew and reconnect and revision with each other with God and we traveled we traveled and we did something we uh traveled to where the earliest churches in the world were started amen were the very first churches in the whole world were started and we would stand and I would stand and like because a lot of those cities don't even exist anymore so you're standing in Ruins you'd stand in the place where the very first churches were started it was powerful and I would think this thought in each City I would think this is the same God the same God that was moving in this city is moving in Lynn amen still moving now the same God that was rescuing people then that I read about in the Bible in Acts I would be reading my Bible right then and there I'm like it's happening right now in Lynn the same God that was healing people then is healing people now and the same God that was freeing people then is freeing captives now and the same God that was raising up Champions then is raising up Champions now man it's recreating it's renewing it's refreshing and you may notice that sometimes I leak on here on Sundays the uh the uh so many allergies in this room the uh so I don't know I got to get take care of that I forgot my allergy medicine but it's so wild like so my wife and I were on this it wasn't like a Christian thing that we were doing we were like with a bunch of heathens we just turned it into like this pilgrimage on our own and so with a bunch of people and I'm standing and he's like they're just there for history I'm there for like spiritual reasons and I'm standing like leaking like in people around me like what's going on with this guy I'm like I'm having a moment with Jesus right now leave me alone so I'm being recreated you can come if you want but I'm leave leave me alone I you running ahead staying behind um sneaking into places true but breaking strongholds watch this breaking strongholds is part deeply Supernatural and requires the breaking off of spiritual attachments and curses through the power and authority of Jesus Christ and that's part one and man that sounds sexy it does it's like right it's fun right right right part two is just as important it's keeping the curse off and one of the tools is Sabbath it's not a word I just made it up Sabbath that is the regular spiritual Recreation or Recreation notice they the same word and it costs time it costs you something it costs money because it because it costs time it costs money like you're you can't work during that time you can't make money during that time if you're going to go on a retreat that costs you some money to do it if you're going to go in a pilgrimage that'll cost you uh money to do that's not free it takes in tionality you don't normally accidentally go on a pilgrimage you don't accidentally Sabbath you plan you prepare you get ready you might actually start today to plan for a pilgrimage four years from now some people will plan for 20 years to do it and that's that's okay but you remove yourself you recreate this is how you live in abundance and freedom and keep the curses off generationally for years for decades for a legacy that lives long Bey past you as the worship team comes up much of this series may have seemed like it was about breaking curses of addiction from from like the classics like the obvious life controlling problems that everybody knows ultimately lead to devastating consequences right but I've been waiting for this but what if your drug dealer is your boss and what if he isn't selling you drugs what if he's writing you a check to buy a little bit of your soul because you're compromising your life purpose for a check y listen if you're delaying or sacrificing the Fulfillment of your Divine Purpose or call this is me sounding the alarm and saying it's time to return to your Divine Purpose hallelujah it's time to lace up the boots and start walking towards the fullness of your god-given purpose you see renouncing for some may literally mean trusting God and not trusting money returning to your first love trusting God's purposes not trusting your own plans it may be more difficult than any of the other things we've talked about so far in the Book of Revelation Chapter 2 there's a letter a letter that was written to a church it's really from from God to this church in Ephesus one of the places that I went to it goes like this says I know all the things you do I've seen your hard work your patient endurance I know you don't tolerate evil people you have examined the claims of those who say they are Apostles but are not you have discovered they are liars you have patiently suffered for me without quitting but I have this complaint against you you don't love me or each other as you did at first [Music] look how far you have fallen turn back to me and do the works you did at first you see when you are away from your first love you become exposed to purposes that are not from God and so God calls you back calls you to return home at one point in the ministry of Jesus he was with his first followers and there was a crowd of fans that had gathered around and spiritually curious people and Jesus looks back to them he reaches out to them and he invites them to become part of his kingdom to follow him and he clarifies for them so they would understand what it meant exactly what it means to follow him and this is what he says in Matthew chapter 8 and this applies to us today then calling the crowd to join his disciples he said if any of you wants to be my follower so if you're here today and you're interested what does it mean to follow Jesus I'm curious you must give up your own way take up your cross and follow me if you try to hang on to your life life you will lose it but if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the good news you will save it and what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul is anything worth more than your soul would you stand with me as we closeall [Music] so today let's close with this what are you hanging on [Music] to what is Jesus calling you to you know he's still saying today come today and follow me lay it down give up your own way and pick up the way of Jesus he still calls to all of us today so whether it's to remove yourself whether it's to recreate or whether it's to return to Jesus some something for you to respond today the worship team will close us with this the altars are open let's spend some time returning to Jesus [Music]", "in a broken and chaotic world there is one truth that remains the truth that love is stronger as the world begins to re-emerge after two years of confusion in whatever state you may find yourself in please join us at east coast international church to discover and embrace this love [Music] you", "[Music] morning good morning friends i'm so glad that i get to be with you this morning because did you guys have a great week anyone have a great week listen if you didn't do you remember the super bowl halftime show anyone did you guys not watch it listen you need to go on youtube it is the second best halftime show of all time beyonce was first but this one was definitely the second best it was so great we had sun out today we've had sun this week a little bit of snow yesterday we're gonna pretend that didn't happen right but overall i feel like for me i've had a great week because it was sunny out because we got to see mary j blige again like it just has been so great this week but um if i am honest with you it has been a little bit complicated because pastor kerr is away did you guys know this pastor kurt and jen are in israel walk in the holy lands they say hello look at them they look so extra holy don't they yeah it's been you know they've been away so we've been kind of figuring things out on our own this sunday we are all switching things up and you guys get me so oh you shouldn't have but um if i am honest worship today was especially um impactful for me we're singing the song about god's faithfulness about how god has been so good to us and this last month has been really hard for me my boyfriend has had some health issues it's been really chaotic and when i knew i was preaching today whoo i was like man how am i going to stand there in the midst of all that we're working through all that we're going through and say that god is good but let me tell you that god is good that he is faithful his promises are for today exactly that sometimes we find ourselves in these difficult situations where we may not see any way out we may not see a rescue but god sends a person have you ever had a situation like this see as as complicated and crazy as this last month has been for me and for our this whole situation god has used incredible people who have taken up the the mantle of being the church in our lives we had people when we had cova diagnoses who still said yes the kids can come over after school which it's crazy we had people who came and delivered food for us who came and just prayed with us and sat with us who gave us what we needed in the difficult time and that that act of ministry of love was transformational i remember sitting with mila and mikka his children and they were like oh my gosh everyone loves us we're getting fruit baskets and flowers like everyone loves us this is crazy it's like it is crazy but it's not because they love us it's because they are being the church see church isn't a place that we just go to it's not the building it is when the people of god rise up and say yes i will love like god i will be the hands and feet of jesus and they just looked at me they're sick so they're like okay i don't think they got it but they'll get it eventually but you see sometimes we find ourselves in these terrible situations and all of a sudden someone comes along at just the right moment right i had a funny situation happen to me when we renovated the upstairs bathrooms they put on these um what they call the motion sensor lights right and at first they were like we're gonna be for for the record they were men who set them up which men use bathrooms much quicker than women right so i go to the bathroom like oh cool we're saving energy saving money and i'm sitting there and all of a sudden the lights turn off which when you're sitting in the bathroom you can't do anything about so i'm like oh awesome and then i go to get toilet paper no toilet paper i'm like this is the worst like this is my nightmare and so i'm sitting there i'm like help hello because it's like i'm in the bathroom it's awkward right so i'm screaming on the top of my lungs and finally i just feel i just give up i'm like okay this is my this is my life now i live in a dark bathroom when someone finally came in what felt was way too long and they turned the lights on i was able to explain got toilet paper and it was great right this also happened in my life and in a serious situation when i was uh 18 years old 17 18 years old i had a really chaotic family life going on and my friends mom and aunt they showed me what it was to be the hands of feet of jesus when they said to me tanesha this is not okay this is not your life and you don't have to live it anymore and they literally said we're gonna go pack up your stuff and we're out and it was so transformational to see people take on god's duty and take on his love and to do that for me right and what if i told you that god created you to be the change for those around you waiting to be rescued you see in ephesians 2 10 it says for we are can you guys say we are we are god's masterpiece he has created us anew in christ jesus so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago can you say long ago there's something here about god created you to be his masterpiece to do good things he planned for you long ago long before you even knew that you were qualified long before you would even say yes that god created you and said i am going to set my person free in this world to do good things well why right there's a people i want to read to you from exodus chapter 3 and 4 about moses because moses i just i feel like i resonate so well and you will hear throughout the day but how i just moses was someone who was just doing his thing trying to live hidden trying not to go and he wasn't trying to become moses of the bible he was just like i'm gonna do my thing live my life that's it but god knew that there was a people who were waiting for rescue in exodus chapter 3 verse 7 it says then the lord told him i have certainly seen the oppression of my people in egypt i have heard their cries of distress because of their harsh slave drivers yes i am aware of their suffering so i have come down to rescue them from the power of the egyptians and lead them out of egypt into their own fertile and spacious land it is a land flowing with milk and honey they were the canaanites hittites emirates parasites hivites and jebusites i don't know if i said any of that right but it's where they live look the cry of the people of israel has reached me and i have seen how harshly the egyptians views them you see there was a situation that was going on the people of god they were enslaved they were living their lives stuck under the hand of pharaoh only allowed to do what pharaoh said that they could do only allowed to live how pharaoh said that they could live and worst of all that they were working tirelessly day and night they were not seeing the fruit of their hands and they were forced to live in this terrible terrible situation and they were crying out to god and see rescue can be for big situations like this that it is possible that there may be a big situation going on in the world that god has created you uniquely to get up and to fight and rescue can also be for small situations i had shared this with my friends in kids church years ago it's one of my favorite testimonies about god because when i was in college i was like broke broke like broke broke i had no money i was a homeless kid going to school working and my money went straight to the school and i remember one day i ran out of toothpaste if you know me you know i am very passionate about dental hygiene and i love brushing my teeth i floss regularly it's just like it's like my thing but also it's like everyone's thing right literally ran out of toothpaste and i'm like so distraught because i'm like i don't even have 99 cents to go to the dollar store and get toothpaste so i use my last bit of my toothpaste to go back to my room and i'm like what am i going to do when i get a knock on my door it was a girl who we were friends-ish acquaintances and she had a ton of extra toothpaste and she just said hey do you need toothpaste and i was like how did you know i never told her she didn't know anything about my financial situation yeah she showed up at just the right moment right see rescue can be for these big situations but rescue can also be in little things but the thing that they have in common is that god has created you can you guys say me that was you could do better that could you say me god has created you to be the answer for someone's rescue one of the things i want you to pay attention to here in exodus chapter 3 is that god isn't at all concerned with how the israelites got where they got he's not sitting there thinking and telling moses well go go rescue them but make sure they know what they did wrong make sure they know how they got there right and like i don't know parents do this all the time with kids i do it all the time with kids you know you fall get hurt and they're like well you shouldn't have done that and they're like i just need a band-aid you ever have these situations but god isn't concerned with how the israelites got where they got and sometimes when it comes to the situations in the world or in someone who is close to you it's really easy to laser focus on well if you just did this differently oh yeah i'll rescue you but you need to learn this lesson but that's not what god does here is it he just says go and rescue and i remember see when i came to this church almost 10 years ago which is crazy last sunday i was literally sitting there back there i'm looking at the worship team i'm like wow they were my age like how is this how have i been here for 10 years longest place i've been in my entire life like when i came here man i just was like i was crazy if you knew me when i was younger i was crazy and i had my eyes set forth on being a young it's gonna be a single female youth pastor that was my thing and i came to this church and i was like i'm gonna be a single female youth pastor so put me in youth ministry and i was told no but i was forcibly put in the kids ministry and i got there see these little children the first day i was there i'm sitting there with a kid who's painting her nails because i'm like i don't know this is how you connect with kids and she takes the nail polish and she starts to paint her teeth looks me dead in the eyes painting her teeth and i'm like um maybe don't do that um and she takes it starts putting on her eyelids and i'm like oh my where am i i have no control over this situation and i week after week i'm in the kids ministry and i hated it i would pray wednesday nights i come to church and be like god please don't bring them to church don't bring them to church because i just didn't know how to relate to kids i didn't understand i just saw boogers and like craziness and as i started in kids ministry we went through a crazy year of transition it was about a year and a half two years it was a long time a long time and i remember the other kids volunteers and i would joke around and be like oh maybe you're going to be the kids faster you're going to be the kids past there and i was like not me and over the end of the year it was really interesting to me because there was a huge need in front of me and i had come to get to know them come to like them even and i realized hmm maybe these kids do need a leader maybe this ministry and the volunteers do need someone but i am not an aggressor like i am not someone who's going to pursue anything like that i'm more of a passive leader there's a situation you ask me i'll think about it but if there is a situation i'm never going to be like oh me i'll do it i'm not someone who volunteers myself that way but when i saw that there was a need and i saw those kids and i realized maybe there's something that god has here for me it started to change my heart so much so that at the end of the year my school year we were leaving going on getting ready to go back to school and i just was like man i'm gonna miss those kids i was like hold up wait i hate them what do you mean you're gonna miss them and i started to recognize that god was changing my heart and when pastor kerr invited me into his office to ask me to be the kids director first of all i thought he was asking me to be the custodian and i was so hyped i was like yes i'm gonna mop those floors it's gonna be great i didn't even think he was gonna ask me to be the kid's pastor but when that was the opportunity in front of me i knew it's like man these kids these leaders if there's got to be someone and no one's gonna do it i guess i'm gonna do it it wasn't easy it was terrifying but it was honestly those eight years of my life like were some of the greatest years and i miss it deeply i love the kids ministry i love the leaders but man that was a transformational experience just understanding that there was a people there was a people who were waiting so the question is if there is a people if there is a need then who's going to do it right you see with moses god says i have heard the cries of my people i have heard them i'm going to rescue them moses is probably like yeah this is exciting because he was is he was by uh nationality he was jewish so these are also his people he's like wow look at god he's gonna do something great but god says something interesting see he says in verse seven um i'm where they're suffering verse 8 says so i have come down to rescue them and then he says i'm going to lead them out of egypt but uh here's the thing god's not going anywhere he's really this is years before he was getting ready to come down to earth but god says i'm gonna rescue them i'm gonna leave them now you can you guys say now you he says now you go for i'm sending you to pharaoh you must lead people you must lead my people israel out of egypt see god's response to people who are oppressed is you god's response to people who need to be rescued is you oftentimes i think we're waiting and you know you walk down the street you see someone who's a need and you're like man i hope someone helps them god please send somebody their way and i'm not saying that it's our responsibility to help every single person that would be impossible right but there is a reality that god's response is you that there may be a need in front of you at your schools or your workplace in your families in your neighborhoods in this city in this world that god is waiting for someone and that someone is you so who's going to be physically doing the leading is it god nope it's moses and moses like i think any rationable human being says who me you feel that way i remember when pastor kerr asked me to be the kids faster and i was like what me you're gonna trust me i was like i'm a child this is crazy town in every step of the journey i a few weeks ago i went for my interview to get ordained and they're asking me these questions and they're like you know like why do you want to get ordained and i was like i don't know i still feel like i'm like i need to be a big girl pastor and i don't feel like i'm a big girl pastor yet so i don't know why i'm gonna get ordained and they're like well what do you mean you feel like you're not a big girl pastor yet which by the way is a really funny conversation to have with a ton of grown adult people but i said you know sometimes it's really easy even if i see the need even if i hear the call it's really easy to look at myself right to look at my failures my weakness my past and to say god me when i see myself i don't see a pastor i see someone who makes a lot of mistakes who is always losing things which by the way if you find my keys they are currently missing found them good okay good we got them thank god i just see someone who loves jesus who wants to help other people love jesus and i just want people to experience the freedom that god has created them for and i know moses i know he feels this way you know how i know because all he does for the next like 25 verses is complain and protest he goes well god like i well who am i gonna who am i gonna say sent me uh like cause if i go in front of pharaoh who's coming who am i gonna tell them sent me right is it well god but like what what if they don't believe me but god like i'm not good at speaking and even though god has called him even though god is getting ready to rescue people through him moses sees himself see moses i don't know about you guys i i like listen i'm not perfect but i don't really have the same rap sheet as moses because he killed a guy and i haven't not yet by the grace of god hopefully he never will but moses he killed a guy he ran away and he did a whole lot of other terrible things i'm sure that really aren't listed in the bible which if you were writing this because he also helped write this probably wouldn't include all my failures right but his background doesn't define him his past mess-ups didn't define him his culture his his past reality it didn't define him because it's not about him and listen if god can use a murderer he can use you if god can use someone who ran away from all of his mistakes to try to start over and not even tell anybody what happened god can use you and so it wasn't about moses it was about god using him to rescue the people can you guys say it's not about us it's not about us and so many times right this is my journey into ministry i always like but but but i can't but i don't but i won't but i don't know right i when i was an intern and still to this day uh pastor emily and i always had some funny conversations because i didn't grow up in church i went to bible college but i have very little formal biblical education and times i would mess up uh some of the details of the story i remember being up there preaching to the kids telling them about the about how jesus he multiplied fish in loaves and they were like pastor chase are you sure you got that right i was like hold up hold on that was you sophia it was sofia so many times i look at my frailties right but in moses in this moment he does he's just looking at but like what if they don't believe me how am i gonna go i'm not even good at this right this but i but i but i and i know this is a cliche for some of you guys but what i really do is when i hear that in my spirit and my soul start to rise up i gotta say but god but them right but god but them and i need to take that second to take all those fears all of my weaknesses all my frailties and put them to the side because it's not about me it's about god using me to rescue other people so the question is how and this is one of my favorite favorite favorite principles of the bible in exodus chapter four verses one through two it says this but moses protested again what if they don't believe me or listen to me what if they say the lord never appeared to you then the lord asked him what is that in your hand you say what's in your hand try that again you say what's in your hands what's in your hand you see moses when he had left his whole situation he killed the guy and he fled he became a shepherd even though he grew up in the palace he took care of sheep and so he had a shepherd's staff this is what he walked with and at the time he actually was tending to sheep and so he had a shepherd sap in his hand and what might have just been a normal shepherd sap a normal natural thing god wanted to use in a supernatural way see god wants to use our natural gifts and he wants to amplify them in supernatural ways and what god says to moses he says take that staff and throw it on the ground and it became a snake he said pick it back up became a staff again this is crazy then he said here if that trick doesn't work here's another he says take your hand put it in your cloak and he took it out and it was covered in leprosy put it back came out and it was clean and if that's not enough he says you can go to the river pick it up and empty it on the floor and it will turn into blood this is crazy i pray i'm like this is wicked cool but god like if you ask me do something i'm not about to touch a snake i don't care if myself be a staff two seconds ago i'm not touching a snake i'm not touching no blood i don't care but god is using this natural thing to use in a supernatural way and when i was in indonesia i did an internship there and they were asking us okay we sat down to the first day of our internship we have all the interns like all right guys like what do you do what's your ministry and i was like um you know one person was like i love to preach i'm a preacher i'm a preacher and everyone's gonna follow jesus i'm like that's awesome good for you the next person's like i'm a musician you can play a song i can play it anywhere give me a guitar new song i got this i'm like that's awesome i am tone deaf so it comes to me and pastor don butera we actually uh we support their ministry and he says okay what about you and i was like um i can smile i'm really good at smiling i'm really good at helping people feel like comfortable and loved and i'm really good at making friends and it was this funny moment when he was like okay and then i'm like and that's it you need to move something i will do it but if you're asking me what my gifts are that's it and so they made me lead worship the next week and it was terrible but i smiled the whole time but there is a reality that you have natural gifts inside of you right you have acquired skills from your jobs that you have done throughout your life but god wants to use that he wants to amplify he says give it to me what's in your hand and if you hold out your hands you think about what are all of the things that god has given me maybe you can speak that's an incredible gift maybe all you can do is walk and that's an incredible gift maybe what you can do is you can cook or clean or host these natural things that god wants to use for supernatural ways now i want to share with you about ida b wells anyone ever heard of iwls i had heard of ida only because in black history month there's a shirt and it says like be like ida and i'm like sweet who's that but this last week i've actually been studying a ton about her it's black history month yes and ida b wells is was an incredible young woman she was someone who was educated just a little bit more than your average enslaved person she could read and write and what she did is she took that gift to begin to advocate on the rights on the behalf of the rights for people who were enslaved she used this education and ability she actually had a pseudonym and she wrote in a newspaper and she began to call out the baseless and hateful false allegations that led to the mass lynchings because a lot of times they would say they would accuse a black man of doing something that was completely unfounded and then they would hang him and he's she began to write about that so that other people could know what was going on she also began to speak out about corruption in the church you see ida she loved god she followed god what little she knew most of what she read actually was the bible was the majority of her education and so when she heard about things that were happening in churches and then other pastors covering it up she was like torn apart by this and so not only did she call out these false lynchings but she began to call out corruption in the church all because she could write that iw well she began there was an uprising that she stands behind just right well i guess she didn't write on a computer but just through her writings right something that many people you do in school many people might say well i'm never going to write a book you don't have to write a book right you just use what's in your hand can you guys say what's in your hand so if god is calling you which he is to make a difference in the lives of the people around you whether that's in a big way maybe that is in the political world the political sphere maybe that's in just the stuff that you see going on nearby if god is calling you to make a difference he is calling you to do that with whatever is already in your hand but you're not left with just that but he also wants to give you a super natural gift and that's where the holy spirit comes into play where there are going to be moments i've shared this i think quite a few times that i didn't speak in public from the ages i was six years old till about 11. i was terrified i had one line in my second grade play and i still like have nightmares about it i was didn't speak i would hide under my mom's shirt when we were going to walmart which is really awkward trying to walk that way like but i i was terrified to speak period and then god started to call me and say tanisha i have more for you it was scary to think that what he wanted to use was my voice something i had been afraid of my entire life but when god says what's in your hands when he shows you that there is a people who are waiting and i'm going to use you to rescue then our options are that we can back down and say maybe someone else will do it let them take care of themselves we don't have to get involved but if you do you guys say but if you do but if you do god will use you and maybe they may not believe you at first maybe they will not value what you do until later but god will use you to help rescue people and so i ask you friends what is it that god is saying to you where is it that god is sending you you know when i was in bible college i spent a lot of time praying about this like what am i going to do where am i going what's going on and there is an element of perhaps god has something big for you but generally when you read the bible if god has something big for you it's not a secret when you read the bible and god says hey go to this place it's because he's standing there or shows up in some major way to declare go right but the vast majority of people throughout the bible and here um in this world where god is calling you is where you already are that perhaps it's on your sports team perhaps it is in your classes or at your workplace in your family and i will never forget a couple of months ago or actually was a while ago pandemic brain but during the first the first like major uh shutdown i had a friend who reached out to me facebook messaged me and she said hey you know god right i was like sure yes i do and this is someone i haven't seen since when i lived in rhode island years ago she was my in my neighborhood growing up but she was someone who she got to be my friend as i started to follow jesus which was really cool she's like well i just feel like maybe like god wants to like i don't know like god is trying to talk to me and i was like that's really cool what do you mean just like i just everywhere i go i just feel like it's like people are talking about god and they're like pictures about god what what's going on and it was a really cool moment for me to remember back in high school when i started following jesus i started trying to start a bible club but i wasn't out there like everyone follow jesus like i wasn't really aggressive or open about it i just wanted to follow jesus and with the people closest to me i shared with them what was going on in my life so much so that over 15 years later this girl comes to me because she remembered that and she actually had said something to the fact that like well you're the only person i know who knows god and i was like that's probably not true um but you see what is god saying to you where are these people that god has created that these good things that he planned for you long ago is for you to do now and you don't have to go looking for these people you know we spend a lot of time praying about who god where do i go but most times god is asking us to open our eyes and look around us now you see at the church we have lots of opportunities here when i started following jesus i loved going to church because the people who were there man they loved me so well they were people who when i came i walked in the door they gave me a big old hug you guys love that it made me feel so welcome and at home and then there were people who they would sing and they would let worship and my home church listen i love them our worship team was terrible but they were up there just worshiping jesus and it blessed me so much when i was going through some hard moments when i could just stand there and say it doesn't matter what's going on but god is good right and that there were people who cared for those who were in the church and it was such a beautiful thing and see i have served right now as the first impressions pastor young adults pastor associate pastor lots of pastors i'm still not sure what my role is but um one of the main things i get to do on sundays is the greeting team we have the ministry moment for that and see i want to ask those of you who are here who say you know what like i may not be able to do a lot of things but i can open a door i can smile i can say hi to someone maybe there are those of you who are like listen pastor nisha i'm an introvert i'm not about that life hey listen we have introverts who come to church so we need introverts who can talk to other introverts right that perhaps that is one area that god might say hey you know what when someone comes for the first time they want to see a smiling face they want to feel welcome and loved or perhaps you say you know what i can't do a lot i can pour coffee that's a big deal well we didn't have coffee during because we had you know we were allowed to serve drinks sunday morning in that cafe if you weren't in there it was a little volatile apparently people have a real thing for coffee here it's a big deal so you know what yeah i can do that and i'll tell you i may not serve in the kids ministry anymore but those kids they need you that when i was six years old i went to church for the first time and they told me about jesus we made these silly little princess hats and they told us that we are god's princesses i had never heard about this in my entire life and i remember i was super quiet i didn't have friends and i didn't need them because i was just myself but those workers man who sat with me when i walked under the basketball hoop and i got a basketball snot straight to the head and i had a lady i don't even remember her name but she gave me an ice pack and sat with me as i cried that is the reason why i am here today because god had someone who was sat with me who loved me and those kids man they're just waiting for more people like you and like me who would say yes and our teenagers man i started following jesus when i was 16 and youth group and i every time i talk to my youth pastor i'm like thank you so much for loving me because i was obnoxious i walked into the church on the youth group for the first time and i said what's up guys i love jesus and they're like okay that's a lot there's a youth group of like six of us i was the only person of color at the time and i was a whole show and myself and they just sat with me they listened to me when my life started to fall apart they showed up at my house to sit with me and pray with me when i went to college and i had nothing to my name they brought me shopping so i would have clothes man these teenagers are all city youth ministry they're waiting for someone like you and it doesn't matter i'll tell you a lot of times people would tell me when i was in kids ministry and i'd ask them you want to serve with the kids they'd be like well i'm too old i don't have that much energy listen my youth pastors like and my youth leaders they were all in their 40s and 50s and we would run circles around them and they just loved us they just loved us on our worship team here man there are some of you guys some secret musicians out here i know that that some of you guys you played piano or guitar or drums maybe you sing and god is waiting for you because how many of you know some sundays you come in here in a terrible place right you come in a bad headspace you're like i just need to praise the lord and our worship team leads us into incredible moments to connect with god and god is waiting for someone like you to say yes and our media team man where would we be without our media team come on we literally would not have had church through the pandemic we wouldn't be able to be in revere and all over the world right now if it weren't for our media team that god is waiting for someone who says you know what can't do a lot i can click a button you can click a button we need that right now even here in our church we have so many different opportunities where god is saying there are people here and you look around we may not have a ton of people in person here but i'm hopeful all the masked mandates are gone apparently covent just disappeared overnight i don't know but it feels like perhaps we are on our way to like this new normal we've been talking about for way too long that there are people our city has changed right there are new people coming and they need jesus they're waiting for someone like you to say yes i will serve so that when you come we've created a place for you and so i just want to say guys we have so many opportunities in our church in our city in your families in your communities that god has called you can you guys say me and what is it that god is saying to you i'm gonna invite our worship him to come on up because i believe that right now that god is speaking and that he wants to empower you to give you the strength you need to do what it is that he has called you to do and so we're going to take a moment right now we're going to get ready to pray and as we pray i want to invite you to pray two things one if you're like pastor tanisha i don't know i don't know who are the people i don't know where it is i'm supposed to go i'm going to pray that we're going to pray and ask god reveal that to me show me god who are those people where is that ministry where are you is there people waiting for someone like me and for those of you who say you know what i might know where that is but i don't know if i can get around the butt eyes if that's you we're gonna pray that god will give you the courage the strength to say yes to that and the power to do what it is that he has called you to do so i'm gonna invite everyone to stand on up and we're gonna we're gonna take a time just one song we're gonna pray if you say you know what i need a little extra time i just need to pray right now you can come on forward pray that god would reveal to you what it is that he has for you [Music]

Christmas offering so next Sunday when you come is our be the 24th and so our Christmas offering we'd like you to consider highlighting in your giving our Christmas project of El Centro which is our youth center that we are developing now here's here's how you can help Okay how you can help is understanding that the whole project will cost about 1.5 million and so if you get a really big Christmas gift this year you know what to do uh right there 1.5 million but uh if that's too much for you I want you to understand that our renovation cost will be about 100,000 but our just get in cost will be about 65,000 it's still I understand it those amounts of money are really a lot for most people uh but let me break it down a little bit further for you if you're like really i' like to focus on a project inside of that well the parking lot conversion you know you know all the things connected to the parking lot and leveling it out and redoing everything's going to be about 177,000 the flooring of the center will be about 8,000 uh pivoting to energy saving everything it'll be a couple hundred per light the paint is about $50 a can now now I'm finally getting into some of your ranges now okay like I get it I'm coming down coming down like keep going keep going how long can we go um and then in case you're curious the trim or molding is like a150 a foot all right so we got something for everybody there okay so if you'd like to contribute U like Pi pick something and then uh you can just give to that that would be great so everybody can do something have you ever noticed in life that people get confused amen I me I mean I got to tell you uh the whole world seems to change about every 36 minutes now and so it can be confusing to keep up you know whatever the new thing is whatever the shift is going to happen uh there's a lot of confusing things that going are going on out there and this summer I found something that I thought was interesting Jen and I were in a wonderful part of the Old Town in Bari Italy this is on the Southeastern Coast of Italy near the boot our tour guide took us through the old streets where Italian grandmothers would be outside in the walkways making pasta it was great just like in the movies and in the six weeks that uh we I had planned for us to travel this was the spot Bari Italy was the spot that my inner child was most excited to visit like I thought about it for months I can't wait to go to Bar Italy I can't wait to go to Bar Italy let me tell you why because bar Italy is the location of where real Santa is buried sorry some of you didn't know he was dead I apologize for that um apologize but this is the place where real Santa is buried and so I was like I'm going to go visit the grave of real Santa it's awesome so uh so we went we eventually found ourselves at the church in the final resting place of St Nicholas turns out in case you didn't know St Nicholas was born in 270 he had a legendary habit of Secret gift giving which eventually gives rise to the traditional Legend of Santa Claus Nicholas who was a devout lifelong Christian became known for his generosity and love for children and was ordained as the bishop of mea in modern day Turkey now just so you know Turkey Italy not the same place all right these are really far apart from each other now how did the bones of Santa go from mea turkey to Bari Italy is a fascinating bit of history that you'll have to read on your own okay it's worth reading though Santa Nicholas was of Anatolian descent and clearly wait for it a middle eastern man and just for fun this is a picture of my wife Jenny taking in a picture all right at at in in Santa Claus Square okay now after the tour I was talking my wife and I were talking to the guide who was from Bari she she grew up there and she made this really interesting comment that as a child she and the other children did not know that St Nicholas was Modern Santa Claus because Santa Claus was white and St Nicholas was black all right who knew who knew I did not know till I went to Italy now it wasn't until their older age that the children are able to see about this weird confusing shift that took place in the culture of St Nicholas or Santa Claus but isn't it interesting that this type of thing happens all the time where people get confused or superimpose an agenda on something or someone um and so it makes the original entirely IND discernible like modern day Santa this representation of ancient St Nicholas not the same at all or in an attempt to make something more marketable people will regularly change core elements of something so that people will embrace it now people have done this with Jesus for centuries they make Jesus more palatable they make Jesus more marketable trying to turn Jesus into their own understanding or their own agenda well I like my own agenda better than jesus' agenda so I'll make Jesus be my agenda making it very difficult for many people in the world to identify the real Jesus which one's the real Jesus well the real Jes Jesus please stand up all right now if you thought that was your cue to stand up we got some mental health stuff going on right there okay now inside the Christmas story there are these two pregnant women there is Mary who becomes who is the mother of Jesus and Elizabeth the mother of John the Baptist Mary and Elizabeth are cousins and so they're having kids essentially at the same time that's the Christmas story fast forward about 30 years years 30 plus years John Is Now John the Baptist John the Baptist is a prominent figure in the Bible he's also a cousin of Jesus he's a prophet to the people of Israel and at a really critical point in the ministry of Jesus John the Baptist sends Jesus a message the message is this it's found in Mark 11 John the Baptist who was in prison heard about all the things the Messiah was doing so he sent his disciples to ask Jesus verse three very important passage are you the Messiah we've been expecting or should we keep looking for someone else that's an interesting question are you the Messiah we're expecting or should we keep looking for someone else if you know the whole context around John the Baptist it's a confusing and odd question imagine this happening today just for a moment just have fun with this if John the Baptist were to ask Jesus this it would show up like in the form of a text hey cousin are you the real deal or should we keep looking Jesus would have fired back a couple of emojis a gif and a thumbs up with a selfie right you know so like that would have been like the response but but but here's what actually happened verse four Jesus told them go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen the blind see the lame walk those with Leprosy are cured the deaf hear the dead are raised to life and the good news is being preached to the poor amen and he added God blesses those who do not fall away because of me he continues as John's disciples were leaving Jesus began talking about him to the crowds what kind of man did you go into the wild Wilderness to see was he weak was he a weak Reed swayed by every breath of wind or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes no people with expensive clothes live in palaces so I guess that means if you don't live in palaces you shouldn't wear expensive clothes anyhow were you looking for a prophet yes and he is more than a prophet John is the man to whom the scriptures refer when they say look I am sending my messenger ahead of you and he will prepare your way before you I tell you the truth of all who have ever lived none is greater than John the Baptist yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is and from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now watch this the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing somebody say forcefully forcefully and violent people are attacking it for before John came all the prophets and law of Moses looked forward to this present time and if you are willing to accept what I say he is Elijah the one the prophets said would come anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand it's a very fascinating passage loaded with all kinds of stuff that's important in verse five again it says the blind sea Jesus is responding to John the blind sea the lame walk those with Leprosy are cured the deaf here the dead are raised to life the good news is being preached to the poor in the response of Jesus he does a quick recap okay he he just does a quick recap of everything that's been happening miracles signs and wonders The Works of Satan being systematically confronted and destroyed and Jesus saves this big thing for the end he says and good news good news is being preached to the poor now this expression good news that's our translation of that today good news is really an announcement it's a it's a proclamation uh and it was a word that was used in all kinds of uh situations but it was announcement of some great event that has occurred and so how Emperors would use a a good news moment was they would share the good news of a military Victory to tell all the people or they would share the good news of a significant change uh in in things that had been established so when a political leader was communicating a victory or a change in policy he would announce good news now Jesus here is the ultimate king of kings and he's declaring the ultimate good news and it is being received by the poor now this is a really important part of what's taking place in the ministry of Jesus now the good news refers to something that has already been done it's not announcement of something uh in the future it is primarily an announcement of something that has already occurred which is how it was usually used so Jesus is sharing the good news of something that has already been done not something that needed to happen not just a new world philosophy not a new tick tock hack for your life but something that had occurred and this is at this point in the story the good news that Jesus is sharing is that the kingdom of God has come it is the announcement of a major event that God has broken through that God has become human now fast forward to us when we share the good news we share that Jesus has now died on the cross that he is raised from the dead he has dealt with the barriers of sin and evil between us and God the good news of Jesus for us today is not what you need to do it is what Jesus has already done again it's the key difference between true Christianity and all other religions in the world do versus done amen Jesus has done it already the teachings of Jesus while critically important now come with me on this this might sound odd the teachings of Jesus are critically important but they are not the most important part of Jesus ministry it is the supernatural life and act of Jesus to do the work of reconciling us to God that is the most important thing because you can't actually do what Jesus taught unless you personally receive what Jesus has already done am you can try good luck with that many of the elite class in the world reject the whole of Jesus they just they just reject Jesus or they reject much of Jesus but it's not really an academic rejection of him I once heard the late Tim Keller reflect on this he says it's not an intellectual Rejection it is in fact a prideful rejection and here's the idea that you cannot do anything to be right with God you cannot earn your relationship with God you cannot be good you cannot be Holier you cannot be kinder you cannot be patienter in such a manner that you somehow catch the attention of God and he selects you as one of the good ones the only thing that can make you right with God is very simply Jesus but when you are part of the privilege class and let me be clear today that's you we're wealthier than 98% of the world the poorest people in America so we are part of the privileged class even though you don't feel like it all the time but when you are part of the privileged class the extra educated class the middle class the upper class the wealthy there is often an inner sense that somehow I earned to my spot I earned my fancy chair I earned my fancy degree I earned my fancy job I earned my fancy bank account I did it I did it I did it I did it I earned it by right it's mine hands off so the good news is this good news Jesus is sharing is you can't do anything to be right with God you can't earn it you can't put up a plaque about how awesome you were to get it and that's a really emotionally difficult idea for us and is frequently rejected again not on intellectual grounds but on prideful grounds however when Jesus says that the good news is being preached to the poor when he's responding to John he says that what he's saying is the he's highlighting the fact that the poor actually understand him they recognize on an inner level that sometimes things are stacked against you and you can't always get up on your own they already understand that sometimes nothing works in your favor and you just need help to get up and the announcement that a way has been created through Jesus to become right with God the announcement that there is a savior that is going to to rescue you that is at work rescuing you already that a savior has been born that was received by the poor With Arms Wide Open yes of course I need rescued I can't do it on my own and there's a big difference there if we are poor in spirit we can join with the poor in that same response Luke Chapter 2 in the Christmas story that night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby guarding their flocks of sheep suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared among them and the radiance of the Lord's Glory surrounded them they were terrified but the angel reassured them don't be afraid he said watch this I will bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people which is what the Savior yes the Messiah the Lord has been born today in Bethlehem the city of David the Savior the savior meaning an individual that has come to rescue us because we need to be saved to be rescued from our sinick situation in this war zone corrupted world that we live in we actually need the supernatural intervention of God a savior that's what we need no matter how much our pride wants to think we can just do it on our own own here we see it as the poor who meet Jesus and the people who understand that they are no different than the poor let me show you this I've mentioned this before but I'll play it out a little deeper today one of our former presidents Thomas Jefferson when he was 77 years old he used a razor to cut out passages of the Bible about Jesus and just before you get excited he he wasn't doing it to memorize stuff about Jesus he was doing it to rearrange uh things so that he could take away the things about Jesus that were problematic for him and then he paced them together he did this to remove any signs of the Miracles or the supernatural elements today the Smithsonian has the actual Bible it's called the Thomas Jefferson Bible now he once said this he had he had taken he once said this he had taken such care to reduce the gospels to their core message that should prove that he was in fact a real Christian that is to say a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus these are his words so what's really going on with Jefferson here was that he was offended by the actual doctrine of Jesus which was that nothing Jefferson could do could make him right with God only what Jesus had supernaturally already done and Jefferson rejected that outright but he still tried to redefine what it meant to be a Christian to try and boil it down now this is this is an important modern lesson he tried to boil it down to Simply Be the moral teachings of Jesus listen a lot of people like the nice moral teachings of Jesus love people right but people that don't know Jesus want to talk about what they think about Jesus they think that Jesus was a nice moral teacher that told people to love each other it's a whole lot more than that it's not just the basic moral teachings of Jesus it's so much more the good news is that the work has already been done and that we need a savior and that we are in need desperately of rescue every single one of us that's the good news so in verse 12 and Jesus response he says and from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now the Kingdom of Heaven had has been forcefully advancing here we see this that Jesus was not just a teacher but he is the Lord of all not just an example for us to follow but the king of all Kings you see people want Jesus to be a nice cat this is what they do they want Jesus to be a nice fluffy kind cat a kind cat that gently creeps around your house avoiding the the Fine China not disturbing not breaking anything that's what they want Jesus to be but that's not who Jesus is Jesus is a is a fierce lion forcefully advancing shattering the false Idols unashamedly confronting sin unrepentantly turning taking back what the devil has stolen I mean when Jesus is done with your house it's a hot mess everything's broken in that house there's a two different kinds of Jesus the world wants one the reality is very different so there is a question that John asks Jesus that confuses me and has confused me for a lot of years when John says this he says are you the Messiah we've been expecting what are you the Messiah we've been expecting or should we keep on looking John knew Jesus he knew he was the Messiah but something's going on with John right now that's making him question and I'm going to point this help you understand this today jesus' response to John actually comes from a passage in Isaiah chapter 35 a prophetic passage about the Messiah listen to what the prophet Isaiah says and this is part of what Jesus quoted back even the Wilderness and desert will be glad in those days the Wasteland will rejoice and Blossoms Will Spring crocuses yes there will be an abundance of flowers and singing and joy the deserts of Lebanon will be as become as green as the mountains of Lebanon as lovely as Mount Carmel or the plain of Sharon there the Lord will display his glory the Splendor of our god with this news streng strengthen those who have tired hands encourage those who have weak knees pause when people think of like good times this is what they think of right this is this people are happy to read hey when the Messiah comes things are going to be awesome verse four John the Baptist love verse four he's an Elijah figure he these guys love verse four watch this say to those with fearful Hearts be strong and do not fear for your God is coming to destroy your enemies he's coming to save you I mean these are like manly men right we're going to get we're going to destroy the enemies verse five and when he comes this is what Jesus quoted when he comes he will open the eyes of the Blind and unplug the ears of the deaf the lame will leap like a deer those who cannot speak will sing for Joy so Jesus is referencing back to that now why is Jesus saying this back to John because he is redirecting John's understanding of what the Messiah really is going to do I always thought it was weird that John asked Jesus this question he has known Jesus his whole life he's been in Ministry with Jesus he has been promoting Jesus as the Messiah for years and now he's stopping and pausing and asking Jesus if he's actually the real Messiah or not why because John's waiting for verse 4 John's waiting for Jesus to raise up the greatest rebellion in Israel's history he's waiting for Jesus to raise up a rebellion that will wipe out the Roman Empire he's waiting for this Great Rebellion to occur and it's obviously not happening and he's like uh time's running out Jesus I mean that's what that's like the underpinning of all of this as as the worship team comes up don't let them distract you from this why is John asking because Jesus isn't doing the whole Messiah thing the way that John actually thought it was going to work out so John was okay with all the nice stuff with all the freedom and the captives being set free and good news for the poor he was fine with all this stuff it's great but he just thought it was setting up the tone for the Great Rebellion for the Vengeance of God to wipe out the enemies of God so this is not the only type of confusion that has happened people are always and not always people are often times confusing who they think Jesus is or who they think Jesus should be they're putting their perspectives and their perceptions on top of Jesus and trying to turn Jesus into that there are so many versions of Jesus of what people have made Jesus out to be that there is no wonder there is so much confusion because people have created so many Jesus's I got to tell you it's hard to write the word Jesus's in your notes because the word document doesn't understand how to spell Jesus's it's a strange thought there's a lot of Jesus's people co-opt Jesus to meet their own agenda I'm coming back to John's concern in certain political spaces today people know that if they say enough Bible words or enough Jesus words that on the national stage a certain group of Bible friendly people will assume that they're on the same team when in fact they are simply recreating Jesus to try to help them gain power John was a huge fan of Jesus but he's waiting for verse four he's waiting for Jesus to unleash the Vengeance of God upon the Romans and the heathens like in verse four of Isaiah 35 because that's exactly what John thought Jesus was going to do he just thought Jesus was holding it close so when Jesus responds and leaves out the verse four Jesus is prepping John and prepping his followers for what his kingdom is really going to look like the Vengeance of God is in fact going to be Unleashed but Jesus is going to have the Vengeance of God Unleashed upon himself Jesus is going to take the place of all the enemies of God in the entire world and have the Vengeance of God poured out on him Jesus is Calling going to take the wrath of God by accepting the sins of the whole world for my sins and for your sins and it's a good thing that Jesus did this for all the enemies of God because we were all once the enemies of God Amen you see Jesus did not come to unleash his wrath upon Humanity but rather to rescue Humanity but the Vengeance of God still needed to occur and so when he responds back to John someday we'll find out if John understood or Not Jesus was going to take upon himself the Vengeance of God and at Christmas time we sing these carols well some people do and this one Carol was exactly what we're talking about today to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray this is the Tiding of comfort and joy would you stand with me as we close [Music] today today hopefully this helped you hopefully you learned some [Music] things but can I make sure that you don't miss this if you have never understood what the good news of Jesus was then you've heard it today that we are all in need of a savior that Jesus has already done the the work and that all you need to do is respond allow Jesus to forgive you of your sins to lead your life how does that happen we simply ask we simply accept the truth of who Jesus is not just the Jesus that every everybody has said he is or but by who Jesus says he [Music] is so today if you've been wrestling with this during this Christmas season May make Jesus your savior as well make Jesus your savior as [Music] well the worship team will lead us now and as they do there may be a place for all of us to respond maybe we need to set aside some sense of Pride or self-made man kind of idea just allow God to do the work for us and to embrace us as his children the altars are open if you'd like to spend some time in prayer let's respond [Music] today", "at the end of 1941 the grandfathers of my wife Jen and I were deployed to fight in World War II whether on land or tank or sea they all fought the rest of the war to try and defend the world against Nazi onslaught all of our grandparents returned from the war alive but scarred some on the outside and a lot on the inside many of you today have had members of your family serve in Military and experience the loss that can come with that one way or the other today I want to say thank you to you who have served to those that have lost we definitely honor your sacrifice together we long for a day when the world will be at peace where the lion will lie down with the lamb when the world will melt down their guns and weapons of war and Hammer them into farm equipment and where war will be a thing of the past and will never again be spoken of until that day I thank you all for your service that have served and for your sacrifice thank you okay [Applause] so it's good to know that even on Memorial Day weekend you know where church is at it's great to see you great to see you we are in the middle of our Bible engagement goal as you turn off your cell phones the we are in the middle of our Bible engagement goal uh for for the year and this month we're going through Ephesians Philippians and Colossians three books of the Bible which are actually letters small letters written to different churches across the Mediterranean we've covered Ephesians and Philippians so far and today we're going to take a closer look at a letter that was written to a group of Christians in the city of kalasai Paul an early Christian leader we call Apostle an apostle Paul he wrote to the church in kalasai from a prison that he was being held in for sharing his faith in Christ he was writing this letter to a young Church a group meaning a it was a the church was only a few years old but also the Christians in the church were just brand new Christians as well and kalasai today is a modern day Turkey is where that's located the reason that Paul was writing this letter uh to the Colossians and that's the book we're reading the Colossians was he was had been given a report by a guy named epaphras epaphras was uh we understand him to be the pastor or founder of the church the church planner in kalasai he was a likely convert of Paul meaning that when Paul was in the city of Ephesus epaphras was likely came to faith in Christ in that City and then returned back to his town of kalasai now imagine this scene epaphras is in Ephesus he chooses Jesus he Embraces the truth of Jesus and he goes back to his town and he tells his friends and he tells his family and he tells his neighbors about the good news of Jesus this group begins to believe and they begin to gather to pray and celebrate and a church is formed and they begin to grow and they begin experiencing challenges that come like people were pushing back on them and pressures from their family and friends and community so Pastor epaphras goes to visit Paul to give a report and ask for advice on how to address the cultural pressures on these young Christians and Paul in response writes this letter you see there were pressures that were coming at the Colossians there were pressures from two groups of people there were pressures from Jewish legalists because many of the early Christians were were Jewish as well and they were legalists and they were trying to basically take all this new Jesus's the Messiah information and force people into old ways and old patterns and being legalists then there was this other group of people that we call Mystical polytheists what that means is that they were a group of people that were super mystical and they believed in lots of different gods in fact they had lots of ancient gods that were classic like Hermes and Apollo and epaphrodite the gods the false gods of money and music and sex now there was also this other unique cult that took place in in colasai it was called an angel cult and they worshiped an angel angels specifically one Angel the Archangel Michael which we actually read about in the Bible and they they would worship Michael this this Angel uh in fact it was so obvious what was going on that in Colossians chapter 2 Paul writes this don't let anyone condemn you by insisting on Pious self-denial that's the Jewish legalism or the worship of angels somebody say worship of angels that's interesting saying they had Visions about these things their sinful Minds have made them proud it is fascinating to me that even today 2023 people still get distracted by worshiping angels it's there's all kinds of talk out there about angels Angel this and Angel that and Angel this and it kind of mystical circles even though the worship of angels is explicitly forbidden in the Bible you are not allowed to worship angels even today right now there is an entire world religion that has nearly nine million people in it now this world religion is pretending to be Christians but they are blatantly not Christians and are a global cult many of their parishioners have no idea what they actually believe which is very unfortunate one of the things they do is this this is why it's so confusing they use the name Jesus and they talk about Jesus the way that we might talk about Jesus the way that the Bible might talk about Jesus they will they will say things like Jesus is the son of God they will talk about Jesus as a messiah they will talk about Jesus and lots of biblical sounding ways and it sounds like we're talking about the same person but that's not actually what's going on they're being sneaky what they actually teach is that Jesus is actually wait for it the Archangel Michael they have redefined Jesus as the Angel Michael not the biblical not the biblical revelation of who Jesus is but they just have made him the Angel Michael interesting that in kalisai they were worshiping the Archangel Michael in 2000 years ago you have an entire world religion doing the exact same thing and how they do it is they just change the definition of Jesus so 2000 years later from the letter to the Colossians you still have nine million people plus trying to distract biblical Christians into some type of Angel worship or Angel veneration that religion is the Jehovah's Witnesses you gotta pay attention to the details The Details Matter and don't ever mess with Jesus all right the Colossians were in this ancient moment a philosophical experimentation they were all experimenting with things and philosophers are going around and espousing their theories and there was one that they had bought into really hard on the Common Street level philosophy of what we would call hedonism this idea the street level definition would be this idea that pleasure is the highest good and the entire aim of life is pleasure people like well I don't see no problem with that I I don't like pain I like pleasure but this is what it means it means do whatever feels good in the moment whatever feels right in the moment with whoever you want in the moment pursue the highest pleasures and don't hurt anybody yeah this is literally the origin of our modern expression follow your heart it's that expression literally is hedonism follow your heart the challenge with this because some of you might have heard that you're like oh I like that one I like I like that one you know it makes a lot of sense in our in our brain our human thinking that the challenge is this when you establish yourself as the authority in all things on what is good or not good you Crown yourself as king or queen of your universe you are the king of the universe you are the Queen of the Universe you surrender yourself to a philosophy that there is no absolute standard of conduct that's the problem with hedonistic philosophy the young Christians in kalasai were being pressured by their friends and families to Simply add Jesus to just a list of all the other gods it's like hey we got we got Hermes and a Apollo you can just add Jesus in that mix it's fine the problem is that Jesus isn't just one of many gods he is the God of all gods he's the king of all Kings in other words they're trying to say to these Christians is it's fine if you believe in Jesus but don't change anything and certainly don't try to influence us at all another thing about the city of kalasai is that the people used to live in fear to the spiritual forces like these Wicked evil forces and they would live in fear of them and they would do things to try to to appease them Paul is writing in Colossians and he's reminding these Christians that Jesus is Victorious over those spiritual forces and that the Christians have no obligation and no responsibility to those Spirits or spiritual powers I want you to catch this really clearly Paul does not say all of that's just garbage and none of it's true he says the spiritual forces are real but you're not obligated to them anymore he's not saying they're not real he's saying you're not under any obligation to them which is a really important point for us there are real spiritual powers out there and they are not all good Colossians is a letter to address all of those issues and a few foundational aspects of our faith and so today we're going to look at Colossians chapter 2 verses 8 to 10 you were passed out a sheet of paper on your way in that has these uh the scripture on it you can write on it throughout the message today here it says don't let anyone capture you somebody say capture it's like don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high sounding nonsense you might want to Circle those different things that come from Human thinking and from spiritual powers of this world rather than from Christ for in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body so you are complete through your union with Christ to his head over every ruler and Authority there's a lot going on in those couple of verses first don't be captured nobody wants to be captured unless you capture my heart right right but but nobody else wants me you don't want to be captured King James says beware lest any man spoil you another says beware lest anyone cheat you another says watch out for people who try to Dazzle you trying to trick you they're trying to kind of sneak you in change the definitions there is a clear admonition from Paul that there are people and forces trying to capture you or to trap you or to lock you in spiritual and emotional prisons that are separate from truth and freedom so Paul's admonition here to these young Christians and we can expect that to ourselves this works for us as well is don't get captured don't get tricked don't get trapped don't get locked up with empty philosophies someone say empty philosophies and another version says Hollow and deceptive philosophy what Paul's doing he's taking a swipe at the ancient and now modern philosophers and philosophies the vast majority of philosophies in 2023 are variations of the same philosophy of hedonism in kalasai today we would call it secular humanism what does that mean let me Define this this is how you say secular humanism or Hedonism today you do you girl you do you you do you that's what it is that is secular humanism wrapped up in three words you do you you do you you see in the moment these words don't seem like that big of a deal they seem harmless but in the end they are empty and Hollow and lead to devastating outcomes in lives so don't be taken captive by these philosophies literally these empty delusions that sound good on the surface but they're hollow inside you know those tv specials that maybe you watch from time to time or on Netflix about some cult I think to myself how do you how do these people believe this stuff it and I'm like let me pay closer attention it kind of sounds enticing and then they end up in a jungle someplace it sounds enticing but there's no foundation in truth it's empty and Hollow well some philosophies of this present age today would lead you to think that you're not responsible for your own choices or your own actions well that is an empty and Hollow philosophy of course we're responsible empty philosophies and high sounding nonsense High sounding nonsense that's awesome that's called YouTube Paul is encouraging the Christians to reject the fancy words and Theological chaos of false teachers and false prophets they are high sounding they sound fine they seem like they know what they're talking about but in reality it's spiritual nonsense he's saying to them lean in to the fundamentals of Christ Jesus that's why he says at the beginning of the letter for he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his dear son who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins then he does this he inserts a poem inserts a poem into the letter you might not know it you might just read over it not recognize what's going on but he he writes a poem that really captures the essence of who Jesus is in our relationship with Jesus so watch this poem Christ is the visible image of the invisible God he existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation for through him God created everything into Heavenly Realms and on Earth he made the things we can see and the things we cannot see such as Thrones and kingdoms and rulers and authorities in the Unseen World everything was created through him and for him he existed before anything else and he holds all creation together Christ is also the head of the church which is his body he is the beginning Supreme Over All Who rise from the dead so he is first in everything for God in all his fullness was pleased to live in Christ and through him God reconciled everything to himself he made peace with everything in heaven and on Earth by means of Christ's Blood on the cross and so that was the end of the poem in the letter now if we were at a cafe that was dimly lit at this moment in this letter we would just start going like this all right okay like he just did a spoken word or something right right so that's that's what's going on here is this wrapping up who Jesus really is and reminding the Colossians who Jesus really is because he recognizes that this nonsense is perhaps tricking some of them he also goes on to verse 8 and says these things come from Human thinking think about that look at your neighbor say human you're all humans right and we all have thinking and so we're all involved with human thinking but apparently this can be a problem sometimes recognize that these things that they're hearing are not oftentimes coming from somebody who's just thinking about stuff and just throwing it out there just because somebody has the ability to put it out there it doesn't necessarily mean it's true kind of like tick tock a cell phone on record doesn't make me an authority but you can say whatever you want now and the whole world can know about it in three seconds human thinking has the ability to be the most dangerous kind of thinking because of this human thinking wants to deal with the temporary with the now with the circumstances of life and are not necessarily based on spiritual truths human thinking says things like there is no judgment there is no right or wrong there is no hell and there are no demons human thinking says all religion or spiritual sounding thoughts essentially lead to the same place you see you're Street smarts and your human thinking may have seemed to make sense to you in the past they might even still make sense to you in the present but when you compare that human thinking against God's word when you compare human thinking to the life and words of Jesus human thinking and Street smarts quickly become defiant and oppositional to the clear and obvious teachings of scripture in Jesus you know the Bible does say love your enemy my human thinking never says love your enemy pray for those that persecute you is nothing my human thinking has ever thought on its own do not be corrupted by the world I sometimes like being corrupted by the world and my thoughts you know that's the truth human thinking can get us in trouble do not commit adultery be sober minded don't steal don't gossip don't do things that cause people to stumble and I could go on for hundreds of things the Bible says that are contrary to what our human thinking says that's why Paul's warning the Colossians it's because it sounds good doesn't mean it is Jesus once said Jesus once said many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other in many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people sin will be rampant everywhere and the love of many will grow cold but the one who endures to the end will be saved Jesus knew that people are going to try to mess with this this Kingdom of his Paul knew it that there would always be a group of people trying to make the clear teachings of Jesus something different than what he definitely said so Paul says don't be captured don't buy into the LIE don't be captured by that human thinking and that stuff that comes from spiritual powers the spiritual powers in verse 8 from the spiritual powers of this world Paul's recognizing that there are wicked and spiritual forces that are behind many of these philosophies and this nonsense that are intentionally working in opposition to Jesus spiritual Powers if you don't know what spiritual powers are the Bible helps us to understand these are Fallen Angels and Demons that are actively trying to mess with you if you've ever thought the thought man I can't ever catch a break that's because there are forces actively opposing you man I was just trying to do the right thing and every time I try to do the right thing it always is something happens because they're actively for forces actively trying to work against you to distract you to confuse you to mislead you and to corrupt you just thought you were going through life by yourself no there's a whole bunch of spiritual forces around trying to get you to mess up that's why Paul says don't be captured by them don't believe them don't buy into their stuff we got hope for this in a second we'll get there back in 1212 there was a French Shepherd Boy by the name of Stephen that claimed that Jesus had appeared to him disguised as a pilgrim supposedly Jesus instructed him to take a letter to the king of France this poor misguided boy told everybody about what he thought he had encountered before long he had gathered a large following of more than thirty thousand children who accompanied him on his pilgrimage thirty thousand when asked where they were going they replied we go to God and seek for the Holy Cross beyond the seed they reached the city of Marseille France but the waves did not part and let them go through on Drive ground across the Mediterranean as they had expected it was at Marseille that a tragedy occurred the children met two men Hugo Ferris and William porcas the man claimed to be so impressed by The Calling that God had on the children that they offered to transport them across the Mediterranean Sea in their ships without charge what the children didn't know was that the two men were slave Traders the children boarded the ships and the journey began but instead of setting sail for the holy land they set course for North Africa where they were sold as slaves into slave markets they did a large business in the buying and selling of human beings few if any returned none ever reached the Holy Land because two cunning men enjoyed enormous Financial profit simply because they were willing to sacrifice the lives of thousands of children that's a real story in history that happened it's called The Children's Crusade you see there were spiritual powers and demons at work deceiving them and because the people did not have clear knowledge of Christ in his word they became easily deceived and it led to much destruction and heartache so Paul reminds us don't be captured verse 9. turning a corner here for in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body so you are complete through your union with Christ who is the head over every ruler and Authority who is the head over every ruler and Authority Christ is who is the head over every ruler in Authority Christ is you need to understand this really clearly all those spiritual forces that are out there trying to oppose you ultimately Christ has authority over all of those situations which means this this is why this is important all the opposition of the enemy coming at you in your life all the opposition against your mind your body your spirit all the opposition against your family and all the things in your life all of them that are coming from the enemy can be overcome because of Jesus you can overcome the enemy you can overcome mortal thinking you can be victorious over every single thing that stands in opposition to you excelling in Jesus Christ you are capable of doing it you are able to do it as the worship team comes up when the world says no but Jesus says yes because of what Jesus has done you can say yes you see there was a time before Jesus and your life that if the enemy told you to do something you had to do it he had authority over you but when you ask Christ to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life to direct your steps the enemy no longer has any authority over your life so when the world says go left or your thoughts say go left but the words of Jesus Clearly say go right guess what you can choose the way of Jesus you might want to go left but you can choose right when revenge is the obvious choice the spirit of God gives you freedom to choose forgiveness and you can't do any of this in your own strength and you can't do any of it in your own power you do it in his strength and in his power Colossians 2 20 it says you have died with Christ and he has set you free somebody say set you free he is set you free from the spiritual powers of this world all the spiritual Powers he told us about and warn us about now he's saying you have been set free because of Jesus over those spiritual powers you are no longer under any obligation to the forces of this world so don't pledge allegiance to the empires of this world system or to any wicked forces that prop them up because in Christ you can choose when you choose Jesus when you allow Jesus to embrace you when you have been set free from all the spiritual powers of this world recognizing that you used to be dead in your sins now once you are forgiven in Christ you are alive truly for the very first time alive why don't you stand with me as we close [Music] so if you haven't read the book of Colossians or this little letter from Colossians I'd encourage you now you have a primer you'll be able to understand what you're reading that's the idea behind it [Music] but listen carefully today if there is some human thinking that's a fancy nonsense that has captured your attention or heart we're being warned today don't let any of those things capture us only let the love of Jesus capture you but not the things of this world not the spiritual powers and authorities not the human reasoning or thinking not the false and corrupted philosophies of this world not those who intentionally try to deceive or unintentionally maybe as you've been going through this life and you've been on this journey you found that you've been leaning heavily into your own thinking your own Street smarts today may be a very good day for you to surrender those things to Jesus say Jesus I need your thoughts I need your spirit to lead me and direct me so maybe there are some things that you can surrender to him today as you invite him to forgive you of your sins and to lead your life each and every day the worship team will close us the altars are open let's spend some time praying today", "[Applause] all right good morning everybody congratulations you're ending the year right all right so that's a big deal you know it really is why don't you give each other a high five for that just give each other a high five hey you made it to the end of 2023 you're alive and kicking you're breathing I know it wasn't easy for everybody uh this is the last day of the year if you didn't know that um and so what that means just kind of housekeeping item here this is the last day if you're trying to get donations in in 2023 for tax purposes that goes until midnight tonight and so however you give through your bank or church Center app make sure it's done by then so that it'll count the way that you want it to if you're like I don't know what taxes are don't worry about it just give regular okay um so have you ever noticed that uh in life there are some interesting moments and if you're if you've made a decision in your life to follow the ways of God to follow Jesus to uh pursue his purposes some kind of really cool ridiculous things happen and it's hard to explain them other than to say it was just interesting or ridiculous or a miracle like we have different words different words for it but back in around 1980 my when I was a child my my family was experiencing some uh food insecurity and it had been a a common theme for a few years to the point where it was really difficult to figure out you know how food was going to happen that night and one particular night uh somebody knocked on our door and it was unusual based on where we live for anybody to ever knock and so somebody knocked on our door a strange and they said this they said I was told that I could uh live in your house for a week and that you provide me room and board that's what they said I don't know who told them this but that's what they said it's not like a thing it what Airbnb wasn't a thing yet yet vbo whatever it was uh just an unusual moment and my parents being who they are uh welcomed them in and said we're not sure about all that but you're more than welcome to stay in Kurt's room he'll Mo he'll sleep on the couch and uh oh that was the thing cuz the Bible teaches us to um take care of strangers because you might be entertaining angels unaware it says that it's so that's they live their life accordingly and so I remember my mom trying to figure out what she was going to feed this gentleman because there really wasn't enough food she figured something out and that him he probably was very aware of the fact that this was a complicated thing so somehow that evening and the next morning he figured out what all of our favorite foods were like what my mom's favorite foods were what my dad's favorite foods were what my favorite foods were Etc and so that night when he came home from work I don't know where he was working or what he was doing but when he came home he had bags of groceries with him and he did this every night every night he would bring bags of groceries home with him for the week or to our house and each night he would proceed to make one of our family's favorite foods now this was a really cool thing the night that we had oysters I thought to myself this is different see I grew up I grew up in the middle of the country not towards the edges oysters was not a thing where I was but somehow he managed to have oysters oysters uh for that evening's meal well one day he just disappeared wasn't there anymore we went to see where if he was still there he wasn't there no luggage no anything and there was just piles of cash for us true story true storyall my family to this day still calls him an angel like as in a real angel I don't know if that's true or not but it's our story that's what we're going to call him um either way it was like kind of a this one of these moments where God just provided in a way that I couldn't have scripted nobody in our family could have scripted that we couldn't have said stranger will knock on door live with us for a week make our favorite foods give us cash right couldn't have scripted that but that's what happened if my parents are watching don't correct my story it's fine the way it is all right it's fine the way it is the um God is in a business of doing these kinds of things in the book of Exodus 13- 14 you see the tail end of the Israelite people leaving 400 years of Egyptian slavery and they're escaping Egypt they being God is rescuing them from Egyptian enslavement and they are now stuck at a giant body of water they're stuck at the sea so they're trying to leave and get away from Egypt and now they're stuck Exodus 13:18 says so God LED them in a roundabout way through the Wilderness toward the sea here they're at the sea and there's an interesting moment in our life when we experience a significant obstacle on our way to freedom because in case you haven't figured it out we're all supposed to be on our way to Freedom like we're all escaping captivity and we're heading towards Freedom notice that they're at the SE and this is not the moment that God says hey change my mind you got to go go back to Egypt you got to go back into slavery you got to go back into captivity because that's not how God works God did not drown them in the sea either he did not say go and let them drown what he did was he finished what he started who is it that finishes what he starts who is it that finishes it's God because God finishes what he starts here's how it started he began with Moses he continued with the 10 plagues and the warnings he led them out of Egypt and now here they are stuck at the sea and what we do know about the character of God is that he completes what he starts he finishes what he starts that's the character of God but you have to pay attention to this story the Israelites didn't know that yet they didn't know the whole character of God yet the they were kind of rookies at this they' been in slavery in Egypt for 400 years they' gotten all indoctrinated and all kinds of chaos and and foolishness and now God is helping them out of the situation bringing them back thank God we don't always have to be right to be right with God sometimes we can be wrong and still be right with God he corrects us along the wayall Philippians chapter 1: 6 says and I am certain that God who began the good work within you will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns this is the character of God he is faithful continue to continue and complete what he has started so if God has made a plan to get you out of captivity and you are on that plan you're going to get to the Sea and he is not going to drown you in the sea amen you might feel today like 2023 was a kick in the teeth and filled with a few step backs but you're here and you're here right now and God is faithful to complete what he has started in your life you might feel like the Israelites stuck at the sea ready to throw in the towel give up and go back to Egypt you're like there's no way they would go back to Egypt listen to this Exodus 14:10 they're at the sea the Egyptians are coming to take them back into slavery as Pharaoh approached the people of Israel looked up and panicked somebody say panicked panied we don't always make the best decisions rep panicked when they saw the Egyptians overtaking them they cried out to the Lord and they said to Moses why did you bring us here to die in the wilderness weren't there enough Graves for us in Egypt what have you done to us what why did you make us leave Egypt why did you make us leave Egypt because we were slaves we were enslaved it was horrible there that's why didn't you tell didn't we tell you this would happen while we were still in Egypt we said leave us alone let us be slaves to the Egyptians it's better to be a slave in Egypt than a corpse in the wilderness oh man they had their first obstacle their first obstacle I know it's a big one but it's their first obstacle and they don't have any idea who God really is they don't understand the character of God so what they think is it's better to go back into enslavement it's better to go be a slave that would be better than Freedom that's what they think so listen carefully today this is not God's plan for you to go back into enslavement God is making a way for you to walk right through the sea no swimming will be required and I know that that sounds ridiculous but God is in fact a god of the ridiculous ridiculous meaning Preposterous or unreasonable the things that everybody else says are impossible are irrelevant because nothing is impossible with God so don't settle for Egypt when you're supposed to be free if you don't know how the story ends verse 21 Moses raises his hands the sea parts and the land opens a path for them to walk through and they get to the other side it's a great story you should read it sometime in the book of Exodus Joshua moving forward Joshua chapters 5 and 6 this is the same group of people now so the Israelites just fast forward a few decades they've been wandering around in the desert for a long time Joshua chapter 6 ver1 shows us that God had instructed the people to go into Jericho to the city of Jericho they're going into the promised land to get the land that was taken from them they're going to go get the land God's promised now the gates of Jericho were tightly shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites hard pause there's really no reason that they should be afraid of the Israelites really they're not like famous warriors uh but the people of Jericho were like there's a God Factor Happening Here the fact that they were afraid no one was allowed to go out or in but the Lord said to Joshua I have given you Jericho its Kings and its strong and all its strong Warriors bring you up to speed God instructs the Israelites to go to Jericho this group of militarily inferior people they were desert Nomads wandering around with limited skills in this Arena how in the world could they break through the walls of Jericho one of the most fortified cities in history they couldn't it wasn't possible it would be ridiculous to think that they could do anything to capture this city but what do we know about God when God asks us to do something that by all measures is a ridiculous thing that's the time to remember that God is a god of the ridiculous Hallelujah Jesus said in Matthew 19 he looks at his disciples intently and said humanly speaking it is impossible but with God everything is possible am Jesus said that that wasn't just like a fancy quote for the day from Pastor Kurt that was Jesus in fact this is really Jesus 101 this is character study on the character of God nothing is impossible with God and as the Israelites turned their impossibly ridiculous the situation over to God at Jericho as they chose Faith over fear as they chose praise over pouting and if you don't know the story go read it God's glory over and over God's glory they chose God's glory over their personal Prestige and at that point God intervenes and in verse 20 it says when the people heard the sound of the Ram's horns they shouted as loud as they could and suddenly the walls of Jericho collapsed and the Israelites charged straight into the town and captured it that is a ridiculous story it doesn't make any sense nobody said this is the way this is going to happen there wasn't somebody like figuring out the plans and said oh this is how this is going to play out have you ever found yourself hemmed in in life kind of circumstances and there's enemies and you got opt obstacles and barriers and problems and there's no way out you got rivers that you think are impossible or mountains you can't tunnel through or enemies walls that can't be torn down and destroyed it's in those moments friends that it is so critical to turn to God and rest on the truth that God is the god of the the ridiculous those situations that you can't make a way for God makes a way where there is no way it's not just a say it's a reality of the character of God he creates a dry path in the middle of the sea he tears down strongholds that are impossible to tear down he shows up when everybody else takes off God does not always respond the way you would imagine back at the sea imagine a handful of Israelites who did believe that God would deliver them from the Egyptians you know there were eight guys excuse me you know there were eight women you know there were eight women who said God's going to show up they had Faith God's going to do something they they' been holding on to their faith through the 400 years of enslavement they were they were they were hold held on I guarantee you none of them thought oh God's going to like make a path in the middle of the sea right you know might have thought God's going to supernaturally intervene and we're going to end up with a peace treaty with the Egyptians they they they had figured it out another way right you get to the other side I'm telling you there was not a 14-year-old kid on the other side of the sea after he walked through saying I knew it I knew that was what was going to happen nobody thought about it nobody thought about that maybe they thought about the peace treaty but nobody thought about the sea being parted their minds simply could not have fathomed the rescue plan that God had in store now we could have thought about it because Mariah KY has a song right you know you know so you know you know there's a there's a movie Prince of Egypt you know everybody knows that there was a sea and a parted and there's Moses and charlon hon you know we we kind of had heard the story a few times nobody heard the story before then this is a new story I want you to get this today never put limits on God no matter how ridiculous because God is the god of the ridiculous there's a well-known Christian leader that tells the story about the time that he was asked to speak before a chapel a college chapel and when he got to the college there were eight men that asked him to pray for him and so he got down his KNE knes and they they lay hands on him and began to pray and some of them prayed a long time they just went one right after the other and they were praying I don't know if you ever had these kind of moments when somebody's praying and they just keep on praying they're not praying about any of the stuff you asked about they're just praying you know there kind of wandering they're just going down a path praying and it's just the way they pray well they get to this one guy and he's praying and he didn't even pray for the speaker he prayed for some guy that he was concerned about had nothing whatsoever to do with the school or anything he was just concerned about him and he and he began to pray and he said this dear Lord you know Charlie stus he lives in that silver trailer down the road a mile you know the trailer Lord just down the road on the right hand side the speaker wanted to interrupt and tell him God already knew where the guy lived and didn't need directions but he just knelt there trying to keep his head upright the prayer went on Lord Charlie told me this morning he's going to leave his wife and three kids step in SP and do something God bring that family back together that was the end of the prayer end of prayer time the speaker went on to preach at the college chapel and things went well he gets in his car he's heading home he's driving down the Pennsylvania Turnpike and he sees a hitchhiker and he feels compelled to go pick the hitchhiker up so he pulls over P picks up The Hitchhiker and the speaker says after a few moments they were driving he introduced himself and asked the gentleman what his name was and hitchhiker's name he said my name is is Charlie stus I couldn't believe it I got off the turnpike at the next exit and headed back hitchhiker got a bit uneasy and with that and after a few minutes he said hey mister where you taking me I said I'm taking you home he narrowed his eyes and asked why I said because you just left your wife and three kids that blew him away all right yeah yeah that's that's right he said with shock written all over his face he plastered himself up against the car door and just stared at him the rest of the time the speaker says then I really did him in as I drove right to his silver trailer on the right hand side when I pulled up his eyes seemed a bulge as he asked how did you know I lived here I said God told me when he opened the trailer door his wife exclaimed you're back you're back he whispered in her ear and then the more he talk the bigger her eyes got I then said with real Authority the two of you sit down I'm going to talk and you two are going to listen and man did they ever listen true story actually happened so ridiculous so you can't script that story it's an impossible story but one you can see the Fingerprints of God all over because God is the god of the ridiculous in one of the most famous stories in history a young boy defeats the fiercest Warrior of the day on the battlefield how can he do this it's not possible it's completely impossible it's absurd it's ridiculous to even suggest that such a thing could occur and this is the story of David and Goliath this summer my wife and I at the near the end of our sabatical we were in Florence Italy and in Florence is where the statue is of David this is the uh PG version of The Statue okay so I just something a quirky personality thing for my wife so throughout Florence is it's basically a a city filled with naked statues okay basically that's what Florence is it's hysterical and my wife was so done after 5 and a half weeks of looking at museums and statues and paintings she's like I just going to go to the cappuccino I just want a cappuccino at the cafe I said and she go shopping so I said I'll meet you after the tour and so I go in and we're just magnificent art and sculptures everywhere it's it's just great and my wife is still happy she didn't go on the tour okay but um so you see David it's just giant statue and it's obvious who he is uh and at the end of the tour the tour guide says this group of several dozen people maybe about 50 people she says now who knows who the statue is of now everybody knows the statue is titled David but nobody knew who David was now I knew who David was I thought I'm just going to be quiet for a second and watch what takes place I want to see if anybody else knows the story do you know in that group nobody else knew she goes David as in David and Goliath blank blank stairs she then goes on to tell the story The Bible story of David and Goliath so that the people and she uses the the the statue to explain it because David actually has the slingshot all right he's ready to go uh you can't see it in this for PG purposes all right just Google David you'll understand what I mean the uh they had no idea about David and Goliath now if you don't know the story of David and Goliath I'll give you the abbreviated version here's what Watch What Happens in 1st Samuel 17 I'm skipping through several verses but don't worry about this so Goliath is this fierce fierce Warrior that's taking on Israel don't worry about this Philistine David told sauli go fight him don't be ridiculous there's that word Saul replied who's the king there's no way you can fight the Philistine and possibly win you're only a boy and he's been a man of war since his youth but David persisted the Lord who rescued me from the claws of The Lion and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine Saul finally consented all right go ahead he said and may the Lord be with you David picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them in a shepherd's bag Goliath walked out toward David with his shield Bearer ahead of him sne ing in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy am I a dog he roared at David that you come at me with a stick David replied to the Philistine you come to me with sword and Spear and Javelin but I come to you in the name of the Lord of Heaven's armies the god of the armies of Israel whom you have defied today the Lord will conquer you and I will kill you and cut off your head that's one of my favorite verses in the Bible by the way the Lord will kill the Lord will conquer you and I will kill you and cut off your head then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds and the wild animals and the whole world will know that there was a God in Israel reaching into his Shepherd's bag and taking out his Stone he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead the stone sank in Goliath stumbled fell face down on the ground then David ran over and pulled Goliath's sword from its sheath and David used it to kill him and cut off his head now that was fast there is a lot more to that story so feel free to read the rest on your own in 1st Samuel chapter 17 here's the point there's a lot of obstacles there yes sir young boy giant Fierce ferocious Warrior it's impossible and in your life all those obstacles those impossible insurmountable obstacles those giants so to speak in God's Kingdom for the people of God those obstacles are not impossible Jesus once again Matthew 17 at a different time says because you have so little faith truly I tell you if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you Jesus said that I know this sounds ridiculous but God as we are discovering is a god of the ridiculous when you understand or begin to understand who God is when you allow your mindset to be changed ridiculously impossible situations become just another obstacle in your life that needs to be addressed it's like a task lless overcome insurmountable obstacle check really is what it is you know sometimes things overwhelm people things that really shouldn't overwhelm people it's just you're kind of in a bad spot or you don't know or whatever I was once in away at a hotel getting ready for a funeral and we needed some batteries for a camera because family's all going to be there we're going to take pictures and time is of the essence and we realize that we're going to need batteries so I go to the hotel lobby and go to the the store where they sell all the stuff that you forgot at home and I got the batteries and go to pay but nobody's there and I'm looking around nobody's there looking around nobody's there like I have to have these batteries so I look around I I take the batteries out of the store go to the front desk person and I I asked for some help and I said hey can you help me I need to pay for these batteries and she said I can't do that that and I said why not I need the batteries and they're for sale I would just like to buy them she said I don't know if I have permission to sell the batteries like she didn't know she had permission to like sell anything she wouldn't sell me the batteries because she didn't know if she had permission this does not go well with me friends all right so I took out the amount of money in cash which is seldom to have I took out the amount of money in cash to buy the batteries I figured out the tax and added some extra I put the money on the counter and I said here you go ma'am I'm buying these batteries and I give you permission to sell them to me and before she could come up with another excuse I just walked out okay her mindset was so limited that she couldn't imagine a scenario where her employer would want her to sell something to me just a minor obstacle in my worldview but for her it was overwhelming she was young that kind of stuff happens to people all the time an obstacle shows up and suddenly life has become too hard and other times There's real obstacles real impossible situations but when you serve a God who does ridiculous things obstacles watch this obstacles are just the beginning of fun stories of victory that you will tell later on am if you never had an obstacle in your life if you never had anything of challenge in your life and people are like hey can you tell us your story be like no I don't got a story there I had no obstacles I had nothing to overcome when we were starting the church this church uh Jesus started the global church just so you know not me okay so just this church we needed a place to rent and it was complicated to find a place to rent um things were really expensive or too big or too small it was just just a nightmare So eventually we asked the school department here in Lynn for permission to rent the school I called up uh and I asked them if they could send me the rental application and this is pre like email like I mean it was like pre like they send you stuff really easily it was complicated back then um and so they said to me on the phone once they realized that I was part of a church they said actually we don't rent to churches well besides being illegal I said okay uh how about you send me the application anyhow because you rent to churches now I just assumed I was not going to get anything in the mail and I'd had to figure it out later on but sure enough we got the application and a story that's way too long to tell the story is ultimately God made a way for us through lots and lots of opposition the next time somebody says to you that's not possible the next time you're trying to pursue the will of God in your life and something stands in your way saying that's not possible something in your spirit needs to rise up and say nothing is impossible with God and nothing is impossible for me when I'm on God's side that has to Rise Up from within you and you can only have that happen if you understand the character of God that God is the god of the ridiculous he is the god of doing impossible things he overcomes obstacles all the time Hallelujah in the Jericho story there was a inside of that story there is a lady named Rahab who was a prostitute that was used by God to do the impossible as a result of her decision to turn to God and follow him she ends up becoming one of the great- grandmothers of Jesus as the worship team comes up she becomes one of the great- grandmothers of Jesus and in the natural that's not possible that's not how the story ends but with God nothing is impossible amen and maybe you can relate to this idea that you've been selling yourself you've been selling your gifts you've been selling your talents to people or organizations or businesses and maybe you've realized that there's no significant purpose going on here I want want to challenge you with this right here as I sneak this in here at the end of the message following an example of an impossible situation like graab who has a hard pivot and God ends up blessing her miraculously what if you take everything God has given you and you turn it all over to God because you're discovering the character of God and you watch God do something ridic ulous in your life and with the rest of your life you know we all have different seasons of life and I I'm always intrigued to how people think about their own Seasons when you're younger or and you're getting a little bit older and a little bit older and sometimes people get to 65 years old and they just think they're done but that's just not true um 65 for a lot of people if they pay really close attention is the moment they get to do the stuff they always really wanted to do that's kind of do the the do the greatest things in your life with the rest of your life it's it's that great opportunity I believe that there are some obstacles that you are facing that God wants to help you overcome that God wants to do impossible things with your life and help you to have stories that are just ridiculous so ridiculous that honestly people won't even believe it when you tell them like people don't really believe me when I say like an angel visited our house and slept at our house for a week but that's what I think I was there I experienced it it sure felt like it there are some ridiculous things that God wants to do in your life and through your life let him do those things would you stand with me as we [Music] close so think about this is there something holding you back is it the sea is it Jericho's wall is it your past is it the failure or the the tragedy or the abuse or neglect or disappointment or [Music] disillusionment what if that thing that you've been wrestling with for the last 25 minutes that impossible thing that overcoming thing that thing where you say inside your head Pastor Kurt you don't know the crazy thing that's in front of me what if that impossible thing to overcome was in fact overcomable what if you leaned into God's ridiculous grace and mercy no more beating yourself up but instead just choosing to walk with god what if you allowed that to be released in your life your spirit your mind and your heart what if you chose to bring that understanding of the character of God into your marriage or your family or your finances or your friendships or your career or your purpose or your church what if you understood that character of God so deeply that it impacted every choice you made the worship team will close us today as they do let's spend some time praying talking to God turning things over to God no more running back to Egypt but moving forward through the path that God makes the altars are open", "okay wear iness tearing down stronghold series Breaking the curses if you're comfortable with your stronghold just okay having strongholds and curses in your life then you don't have to pay attention to this series you can just live with those curses and and deal with the consequences but if you'd like to break those curses stay focused okay and if you if this is your first time here you might want to go to our YouTube channel and go uh listen to some of the services uh from the past uh three weeks and catch up so several several years ago King Edward VII of England it's a true story he had just become king of England and he decided that he wanted to marry the Forbidden love of his life and in order to do so he needed to renounce the throne he could no longer be king of England that's a pretty significant decision he gave up the claim and all his rights as king and he stepped down from the throne as King of England in 1936 and right after he steps down from the Throne of the king of England in 1936 this is what he says listen carefully a few hours ago I discharged my lost Dy as king and must be to declare my allegiance to him this I do with all my heart I declare my allegiance to him this I do with all my heart those words hit me I declare my allegiance to him this I do with all my heart there's only only one person I do that with that's Jesus let me ask you today have you ever asked Jesus to take over the kingship of your life the Throne of your life you see we all have a we all have a throne of our life and we all try to play King of our own life we all try to be God of our own life the question is have you stepped down from the Throne of your life have you renounced the Throne of your own life and have you then had your brother Jesus step into the Throne of your life and pledged allegiance to Jesus the king with your whole heart every heart has a throne and most people try to stay on the throne of their life just completely messing up their life trying to be God trying to be ruler of their own life thinking they can do it better thinking they can figure it out they know best and we know how that works out but there are a few that become so passionately in love with Jesus that they freely renounce the Throne of their own life and willingly declare Jesus to be the king renouncing all former allegiances all former alliances all former affinities and submitting themselves to the kingship of Jesus this is a pretty significant deal in our ongoing series and tearing down strongholds and breaking curses finding freedom in everyday life we have learned so far about some things that we need to do we need to make declaration that the curse is broken we we learn that we need to grow up seriously grow up set aside childish ways childish things childish thinking we need to obey one the sexiest words in our language oh yeah we need to experience repentance and we need to receive forgiveness that's cashing the check got to cash the check if you don't know what that means watch last week's service today we're going further into the weeds and we're firing Up the Weed Whacker we're going to get into the weeds and we're going to we're going to do some damage today it might even hurt a little bit today and I do not apologize but it it's it's for our own good okay this today we are talking about renouncing someone said renounce renouncing because we're going to renounce stuff Proverbs chap it comes from Proverbs Chapter 28: 13 says it comes from this whoever conceals their sins does not prosper but the one who confesses and renounces them finds Mercy okay there's two things confess and renounce some people are awesome at confessing their sins like they make a list okay listen listen carefully some of you have done really good job at making your list of everybody that you've hurt everybody you've offended everything you've ever done wrong okay that's great that's step one that's part of it confess and renounce so when you confess and renounce you find Mercy so this is a process of identifying specific Sins Not General like Father forgive me for I've sinned it it's it's not all just kind of some broad forgiveness thing this is like very specific you're like really going after the very specific details so how do we tear down strongholds so that we are free from very specific entanglements or demonic attachments well this is partly done through announcing it's a step further than repenting it's really going after getting into the spiritual weeds and uh and renouncing it and renouncing is this it's formally declaring one's abandonment of a claim a right or a possession of something so you're like so you're abandoning it it's no longer uh attached to you it's no longer part of you it's no longer part of your life so how is it that you actually do that how do you renounce a thing well in the city of Ephesus back in uh the book of Acts there was a a significant move of God and in this particular City it was filled with paganism and the worship of false gods and goddesses and it was a hot mess there was all kinds of sorcery going on and many in verse 18 it says many who became Believers confessed their sinful practices a number of them who had been practicing sorcery brought their incantation books and burned them at a public bonfire the value of the books was several million dollars so the message about the Lord spread widely and had a powerful effect now they were renouncing is what they were doing just to be clear this is not an Bible endorsing book burning it's giving you an example of the Ephesians publicly rejecting a former way of living thinking believing and practicing they were just drawing a Line in the Sand saying we're not that anymore they literally destroyed the things that hindered their relationship with God yes they just destroyed them so I want you to ask yourself the question today what are the things the attitudes the systems that you participate with structures that are around you the things that you've just been okay with maybe it's clubs maybe it's something else what are the things that you need to get rid of that hinder you that harm you that slow you down from your relationship with Jesus from finding true and complete Freedom that's what we're talking about man there's some things that slow you down renounce it for the Ephesians they went out and burned it millions of dollars worth of stuff I used to have a closet in my office where I would uh keep trophies of God's grace things that symbolize the things that people had renounced because over the over 30 plus years of ministry people would like meet with me me or pray with me and they would like bring something to me and say Hey you know I'm this I'm done with this and I just need you to take this for me pray and they'd just be done they'd be free no more walk away from it never turn back some you know so my over the years my office closet got filled with like unique lighters or you know cigarettes or guns and other weapons and drugs and then drug making equipment and drug paraphernalia all kind kind of cell phones and scratch tickets and track passes and all kinds of cut up credit cards and Al all kinds of alcohol and engagement rings you don't get the key to this closet okay just so you know after a while I realized I'm going to get arrested it's not mine it wasn't me finally I got rid all illegal things yeah it's a dangerous closet I used to open the closet up and said Thank You Jesus and lock it back up now on a side note if you ever feel the need to get rid yourself of violent demons and you want to give me a gun please make sure it's not loaded please lived experience there make sure it's not loaded okay makes my life easier when I have to turn it in and again I don't have to say where I get stuff from when I give it to the police just so you knowall when I was youth pastoring I would uh frequently take the teenagers out and I when I say hey let's go hang out for a little bit I want to meet with you and we'd meet at the church and I would have them Drive okay and so we'd be going down Route One and I would do this on purpose because I wanted to rumage through their car while they were driving CU they couldn't stop me cuz they were driving okay Ian I would go through the glove box I'd go through the center console I'd look through their back seat their their their school bags it was great it was the best and I'm just looking through stuff I'm seeing stuff they shouldn't have or stuff that's not good for them I'm throwing it out the window on Route One true story true story I'm just like renouncing things in the name of Jesus for them I renouncing in Jesus name boom out the window it goes now you're like did you really do that 100% 100% unfortunately doesn't really work that way I can't renounce things for you I wish it worked that way because your life would be a lot easier okay but it doesn't work that way I can join you I can pray with you for you over you next to you around you under you but at the end of the day you got to do it you have to renounce it the end of the day you've got to do the work and it's hard truth is it's hard and for each person there are things that are unique to you man that you got to fight through and you got to do the work and you got to listen to God When God says it's time do it don't hesitate because that's your moment of Freedom it's your moment of Freedom whatever it takes there was a young lady that attended our church for years and she kept having some really really unusual spiritual struggles and it became clear that these were Supernatural in nature and we sat down and discovered that she had been heavily involved in Witchcraft and some occult practices in her past and then we discovered something that was unfortunate she she would still physically possessed all of the Witchcraft and occult items in her house she still had all the stuff tens of thousands of dollars worth of books and items and at this point it became clear that she had not spiritually or formally renounced her prior relationship with witchcraft or the occult and from that moment on it was clear that that's what she would need to do she would need to renounce her former involvement not just add something but reject something else and do you know she didn't do it she could couldn't do it and as a result to this very day she has not experienced Freedom now you're like Pastor Kurt that's a horrible story and the reason I'm telling it to you is this because that's what happens when you don't renounce is you don't find Freedom if you want freedom there's renouncing that has to take place and there's moments in your life when you come up to a moment and it's you a the big reveal or a revelation and it's time to deal with it and now you need to deal on and we know we talked about last week for a little bit it sometimes it's difficult to change we get it it's hard to change you're like Pastor I've been dealing with this for 30 years well it' be nice not to deal with it anymore right but we get it it's hard to change you know you're committed to healthy eating you're like you're going after it you're like no more french fries in Jesus name right but then then you got to drive down Boston Street you don't got to renounce french fries you got to renounce Boston street right you got to go down Western Avenue I don't know who thought up Boston Street um or maybe you're maybe the reality is you're that person that's always complaining or griping or gossiping about other people focusing on what other people need to do rather than on FOC so that you're not focusing on what you need to do or maybe you're like on your way to the gym every day and on your way there you decide to talk call the person that you know will talk the longest so you don't actually have to go into the gym it's hard to you know it's hard to change it's hard to make changes or maybe you're like it is finally time for me to grow up and stop smoking weed I could I could just leave it there but I'm going to go further it's time fine for me to grow up and stop smoking weed and but then you keep on going over to your homie house for the game knowing that he always has more extra blunts than Snoop has it's hard to change right it's hard there's always something there's always something or you're dreaming about building generational wealth getting out of debt for your family for your future and then you find yourself spending more than you make every month on you don't need and on a lifestyle you really can't sustain or don't need to it's hard you know what all that stuff is that's all stuff you can renounce all of it is it's all stuff that you can do real spiritual work in it's hard to change and we know that you need the help of the Lord and you need the help of each other in 2 Corinthians chapter 4:2 it says but they have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in crafting nor handling the word of God deceitfully there's that word renounced again in the Bible there are several places where there are essentially lists of things to avoid change and if necessary renounce okay so we're going to go through this list one of these lists here and as as we're going through the list I want you to think to yourself are these things that are currently in my life things that have been in my life things that are in my family story that have impacted my life and how so I want you to kind of engage with the list that way and how it has impacted you okay it's not a list of judgment uh it's a list to like just acknowledge okay are is this a checklist that I need to work on is this a is in this list of 20ish things are are three things that man I need to do work on this area okay Galatians 5: 19 when you follow the desires of your sinful nature the results are very clear sexual immorality impurity lustful Pleasures idolatry sorcery hostility quarreling jealousy outb bursts of anger selfish ambition dissension division Envy drunkenness wild parties now some of you are like woo got nothing on me so everybody else is like you're lying you know but but but just to make sure that you're covered and other sins like these right kind of a catch all let me tell you again as I have before that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the kingdom of God so just a a list there it's like a checklist hey here's things you got to deal with deal with these things otherwise they are chains and curses on your life things that you got to renounce you got to abandon you got to leave behind let me try to quickly summarize things that need to be renounced bitterness deception gossip these are root core these are core things okay accusation Envy jealousy spirits of rejection unloving Spirit perversion abuse spirit of fear the occult the poverty all of these things all root core core root things that need to be renounced yes a lot of that maybe you're like I can't do all those at once well one at a time then one at a time Galatians chapter 5: 16 so I say let the holy spirit guide your lives then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves so if you don't want to do the things that we just listed let the holy spirit guide your life that's how you do it the sinful nature wants to do evil which is just the opposite of what the spirit wants and the spirit gives us desires that are opposite of what the sinful nature desires these two forces are constantly fighting each other so you are not free to carry out your good intentions but when you are directed by the spirit you are not under obligation to the law of Moses so I want you to think about a couple of things here as we near the end here have you ever wondered why maybe you or a friend is a is attracted to all the wrong kind of guys like attracted to abusive men even though your dad was abusive and you swore that you would never but there you are and you don't seem to be able to choose a good guy to save your life or why you would be in a relationship with an emotionally distant person even though you know better it's in part because of this stuff we're talking about it's because you have to acknowledge it renounce it and find Freedom in that area of bondage these generational curses because there are certain things that are not your fault but they are your problem there are things that were cursed upon you that you didn't do but you got to deal with with it that's due to the nature of living in a broken and fallen and chaotic World in part sometimes living in the N inside of a broken chaotic and uh messed up family you see we all have suitcases okay we all have suitcases some suitcases you pack and other suitcases other people pack the suitcases that you pack that's on you and we all got suitcases and we know what's in there and we got to give those things to Jesus but there are suitcases that we didn't pack but that's baggage that we need to give to Jesus too you see when we're doing this renouncing thing we're not just renouncing the things that that that we were involved in that we were responsible for we're also renouncing the things that were done to us the things that we were not responsible for you were even renouncing the sins that people did to you every once in a while some well well-meaning people will say cringy things and hold on a second because you might have said this cringey thing one of the cringey things that people say is this I wouldn't change any of the things that have happened to me because has made me who I am today you're like oh I said that a 100 times let me two thing two things I think every time somebody says that one who do you think you are second I think why in the world would you accept evil in your life you see somehow people have been deceived into thinking that we're supposed to accept the evil stuff that has taking place in to our life is somehow some part of God's unknowable plan with the overwhelming evidence of scripture is that we are never to accept evil as anyhow part of God's plan we are always supposed to oppose evil not accept it we are never to agree with evil never to accept evil we are always to denounce and renounce evil we renounce the evil plans as the worship team comes up we renounce the evil plans of Satan and then we submit those plans that were meant for evil for us and we submit them to God and then God turns them around and works them out for our [Applause] good but if you just accept it come on now then you deal then you're stuck with the consequences of evil we've got to give it to God you renounced evil and you allow God to turn it around Genesis 50:20 Joseph was sold into slavery and all kinds of horrible and wicked things were done to him but the one thing that stood out about Joseph was that he kept turning it over to God over and over and over again God ends up using him great and he turns it around and in Genesis 50:20 he says you planned evil against me but God used those same plans for my good amen but he can only turn it around if you give it to him if you just keep it he can't turn it around if you just accept evil as part of the plan you can't give it to God for him to turn it around for him to redeem the lost time for him to redeem the Forgotten Dreams for him to redeem the broken heart see you got to take the can to the Redemption Center if you're going to get that nickel you got to take that Brokenness that evil that wickedness you got to take it to God so that he could turn it around several years ago I was out on Union Street with a couple folks from the church and we saw a gentleman in the dumpster over by Walgreens he was rummaging for cans to redeem so I I went over and I said hello I said hey do you need uh any help he thought I was making fun of him and he told me to off I persisted and I said hey I'm not making fun of you I'm serious would you like any help he jumped out of the dumpster all angry and he started flailing around he then proceeded to cuss me out up and down like a professional cusser he was really good at cussing I mean he was so creative the creative ways that he was able to use unrelated words to make them extra insulting towards me if if there was an award like a gold medal for best cussers he would have been an Olympic champion that day that day he would have won gold silver and bronze okay really for real after after he was after he was done cussing me up and down I was licking my wounds after he was done I slowly backed away apologetically I said I'm really sorry that you thought I was making fun of you we were uh just trying to uh be out here doing something that we thought Jesus might do if he were here right now and his face just changed a little not much and so I pulled out a card like this and I I said it had the name of the church on it and where we were located I said hey I'm the pastor of a church and we would love for you to Be Our Guest on Sunday amen and I said don't dress up come just like you are regular clothes I'll be in jeans [Music] also he snatched the card and he huffed away few weeks later Robert walked through the doors of East Coast International Church for the first [Music] time and that day he found a spiritual emotional and physical [Music] family God rushed in that day and began to redeem him and rescue him [Music] for the next several years before until uh Robert passed away Robert became a friend to many of [Music] us and he left a mark that will live in our hearts for eternity now what I love about that story is that Robert was out making a living Redeeming the things that people throw away and I know later he was making $600 a week for real I was 18 years ago a lot of money redeeming things that people threw away and Robert who had himself been thrown away by his family and by Society over and over and over and over again throughout the years God saw his situation and chose no more and decided to redeem Robert because God is always in the Redemption business yes he don't miss this today no matter what it is today that you need to renounce to find Freedom don't forget God wants to redeem it God wants to redeem [Music] you and maybe maybe you understand the idea of having been thrown away by family or by Society I want you to know that God is waiting to redeem you because you are not worthless [Music] so today maybe you need to turn a difficult situation over to God so that he can redeem it don't be afraid he's handled more complicated stuff why do you stand with me as we close [Music] so I want you to get this clearly renounce so God can redeem renounce so God can [Music] redeem don't get it messed up this has to be done under the power of the holy spirit it's the son that set you free not you who set you free you do the renouncing the spirit does the free so you do your part God does his part okay so today maybe there's a suitcase full of baggage that you need to renounce maybe there's one of those things from the list it's time to renounce maybe there's something you need to throw out the car on Route One put in my closet [Music] time to renounce time to walk [Music] away whatever it is start today don't wait don't wait till this afternoon do it right now the authors are open spend some time just go ahead talk to Jesus about it right now let him do that work right now go ahead come on up [Music] Jesus go ahead por team's going to go ahead", "welcome to church today Lynn made the news no no when you make the national news it's not cuz you did something good when you make the national news it's bad news or weird news or complicated news and I think a lot of people rejoicing at this but we made the news because they did a a bust in Lynn and they they the larg one of the largest fentanyl bust all right if you look at if you look at the Department of Justice web page like on the front page so it's a big deal um but it's a problem right we all know it's a problem drug overdose deaths continue to rise as a pastor in Lynn for the last 22 years I have done 10 times more drug overdose funerals than any other kind of funeral we continue to wrestle with subpar and unaffordable hous housing youth violence illiteracy the significant lack of living wage jobs the reemergence of anti- everything anti-Semitism anti-islam uh anti-islam anti- uh it's just anti we continue to wrestle with racism let's just be honest there are some challenges that we Face here in the city so today it's a different kind of a message today it's a work day so I want you to put on your work boots Put on your work hat put on your work gloves and we're going to do some work this morning seriously like get some Tims and lay some up all right you know it's time to work time to work Jeremiah 29:7 here we go and work somebody say work work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into Exile pray somebody say pray to the Lord for it for its welfare will determine your welfare people love this passage they see like oh we're supposed to have peace and prosperity they love those two words peace and prosperity peace and prosperity say it with me peace and prosperity right sounds so good I want some peace and I want some Prosperity I'll have me some of that I'll have two of those please all right we all want peace and prosperity but those are not the two most important words in that Passage the two most important words in that passage are work and pray pray and work work and pray pray and work work and pray for the peace and prosperity there's a reason that Galatians chapter 6 says this let's not grow tired of doing what is good at just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up there's a reason it says don't grow tired and doing good when you're working and you're doing good things and you're praying for the peace and prosperity you're working for the the peace and prosperity it says don't grow tired because you grow tired if we didn't grow tired doing good it would just say nothing it wouldn't be a challenge it wouldn't be a problem because it's tiring to work it's tiring to pray and to pray and to work and to keep after it and to keep after it and keep the the the gas on it all the time it just gets exhausting because it's tiring like that so when it gets tiring what are you supposed to do you're supposed to lean on Jesus You're supposed to lean into Jesus Jesus You're supposed to find your refreshment in Jesus so that you can get back to working and praying so that you can enjoy what it is that God is doing amongst you and amongst us from the beginning at East Coast International Church one of the things that we've said very often is We Exist um we are equipping and empowering the residents of our city to serve and succeed in their god-given purpose and passion empowerment and equipping equipping and empowerment that is a very different thing than dependency equipping and empowering and dependency very different things we don't want people to live in subservient lives living on handouts for all of their life instead we want to empower people to empower someone is to give them Authority and power and access to do something about their situation thank you've heard the saying you've definitely heard the saying if you give him a fish he eats for a day if you teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime if you've never heard that saying you're probably not born yet like everybody's heard that saying but I'm going to add something to it to make it a little more correct it's a more reflective of our modern American economy and economic broken economic system if you give a man a fish he eats for a day if you teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime as long as you equip him with a fishing pole and a permit to fish somebody always be trying to make you have a permit it's how they stop access to Prosperity I could go so deep on that rabbit hole today but that's not what the sermon is about right now but let's take it a step further what if we equip and Empower and resource the man to own the pond and to create an equitable god-honoring and profitable fishing business where the man and his family prosper and those that are employed by him Prosper as well now that that Pam right that is empowerment in action that's the that's the play no longer will the person be dependent but is now equipped and empowered to flourish they their family flourish and everyone that's involved with them flourishes literally sharing the wealth that is what we call call Christian Community Development that is true Christian Community develop it's not just Community Development Community Development can take a very problematic twist Christian Community Development stays right where it's supposed to be early in the book of Acts chapter 3 we learned about this a few weeks back this man had been paralyzed from birth we the story of Peter healing the man who had been begging just to survive each day the man takes up his position to beg in front of the temple knowing that people will be coming along to give the man money but that day was different today that man that day that man was going to encounter Jesus Through Peter he's going to encounter Jesus who is going to heal this disempowered man and Empower him to no longer be dependent on his survival from the people that are passing by am Peter says this uh in verse 6 Peter looked at the man I don't have any silver or gold for you but I'll give you what I have in the name of Jesus Christ the nazarine get up and walk now Peter then extends his hand helps the man up a miracle happened that day and the man was healed and that's great but inside of this is this idea that a man moved from being disempowered to empowered by Jesus and it changed his life forever from disempowered to empowered now we now we have a situation where the man no longer needs to simply survive but now he has the opportunity if he chooses it to thrive from survival to thriving from disempowerment to empowerment and Jesus used a man named Peter to facilitate this moment you see Peter's just a guy he's just a guy that wants to be used by Jesus you and me we can just be a guy or a gal that wants to be used by Jesus to facilitate what it is that God wants to do in somebody else's life to take them from being disempowered to empowered now somebody really needs to listen to me today God is telling you to be Peter today some of you have been walking by the paralyzed Beggars of this world with disdain others of you have felt pity and it makes you feel bad so you toss the obligatory dollar into the hat but today I want you to consider accepting the mantle up on you to be Peter to the disempowered to facilitate their empowerment it's a much bigger ask than throwing a quarter somebody's way no longer walking by but instead creating ownership opportunities of polls and permits and ponds that's the goal Jesus said this he said I tell you the truth anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done and even greater works because I am going to be with the father but these Greater Works greater things depending on which passage which version you read I've spent a lot of time in my adult life meditating on these two words greater things I thought things like this how can I do more thing some things more significant than Healing The Sick raising the dead or casting out demons struggle with the answer to that well it turns out that greater also means more it doesn't say you will do better things it says you will do greater things which can mean more things this is of course makes sense because the followers of Jesus have gone from a few hundred followers to hundreds of millions of followers since that time the followers of Jesus have have had moments of profound followership where we followed well and profound mistakes the mistakes are quite public and on record at any point you want you can go read them all but the victories and Obedience of followers of Jesus are not so greatly obvious but are very impactful Jesus once tells a story about the kingdom of God in Matthew 25 he says then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father inherit the Kingdom uh prepared for you from the creation of the world for I was hungry and you fed me I was thirsty and you gave me a drink I was a stranger and you invited me into your home I was naked and you gave me clothing I was sick and you cared for me I was in prison and you visited me then these righteous ones will reply Lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink or a stranger and show you Hospitality or naked and give you clothing when did we ever ever see you sick or in prison and visit you and the King will say I tell you the truth when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you were doing it to me this this is a different Kingdom it is exactly what authentic followers of Jesus have been doing for centuries the followers of Jesus which we call the church the church has found founded schools to educate the left out the poor the Forgotten and the marginalized all over the planet created hospitals to heal people homes for widows and orphans challenged those in power to bring prison reform and to end the slave trade and to provide better housing countless local and Global Charities exist today because of the church microeconomic development programs shelters and programs for the homeless food food for the hungry counseling centers addiction recovery centers I'm getting exhausted at all the work the church has [Music] done and I want you to get this there are literally thousands of organizations programs freedoms and protections that each of us benefit from every single day that would not exist without a group of Jesus followers somewhere in the world deciding to do something about the very real problem that was right in front of them from the moment Jesus said you will do even greater things the church the followers of Jesus have indeed been doing greater things more love more hope more healing more freedom more good news more Justice equipping and empowering the least of these that's what we've been doing the church so what's our local church response over the past 20 2 2 years we have been laying the spiritual organizational and financial Foundation to execute Jeremiah 29:7 and work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into Exile pray to the Lord for it for its welfare will determine your welfare to work and to pray for the peace and prosperity of our community we have established a vibrant beautiful and growing Church in the Heart of the City and you are indeed that church amen we have established ourselves as servants in nearly every corner of the city we have created space and opportunities for other churches that are emerging within our community to prosper we have created and stewarded one of the most unique nonprofits in the region for young adults experiencing homelessness we created a desperately needed third place or Gathering Place or community meeting spot for our community that is our social Enterprise job training center called Thousand Hills Coffee Company we created at the Mansion our program and place for women in recovery we established our second social Enterprise called The Loft at Stetson for justice oriented job creation our well-curated Thrift Boutique if you don't know about it let me finish if you don't know about it Google the loft of stutson and Vis it on Thursday when it opens which simultaneously has given over a thousand outfits to people in need it has had over 50 volunteers and 30 women have gone through our short-term Employment Program amen while creating a safe welcoming and unexpectedly Sacred Space all in the context of a social Enterprise and it may very well be the nicest retail store store and Lynn now it's possible it's possible that I'm biased but I don't think so I'm just getting started we have run housing programs and are currently developing a total of 48 housing units for homeless young adults we are ready um again friends we are ready again to work and pray once again to bring peace and prosperity to the the city we're not done there's still work to do it's always a temptation to get something done started moving forward sustainable it's always a temptation to sit back on the couch and kick up your feet this is time today friends to put your work boots on and get your knees ready to pray this is a way that we can work together to be like Peter facilitating the work of Jesus in the life of the disempowered in just a few moments I'm going to ask you all to take a 15-second walk with me I'm going to ask you to go with us to the newest edition to our campus at 85 Monroe Street which is right over there we will we will refer to this as El Centro this community center our primary purpose for this will be to equip and Empower teenagers in our community mentally physically spiritually and emotionally socially we will tackle spiritual formation healthy relationships financial literacy Career Mentoring AC academic development Workforce Development entrepreneurial facilitating uh General mentorship and of course an outdoor basketball court people just got blessed right there Holy Spirit just fell right in the the room the basketball court we also will be using this as a venue for our uh uh men's recovery meetings which are just about to start the women have been hoarding all the recovery meetings and now we have some for the men as well so there we go it's going to be a small group meeting space a church Annex a small venue Community Center like meaning a meeting space for the community like for birthday parties anniversaries like other organizations that might need a space to use and and because the dinner church is so successful in Riv it's time for them to multiply and so our dinner church and R is going to start something in Lynn at that [Applause] location we just got a lot of stuff going on how can you participate well you can volunteer to help renovate that's a start um like starting on Tuesday be renovating and uh in the church Center app under events you can like literally say hey I'd like to help renovate uh I'd like to volunteer and uh then it won't give you a schedule but we'll reach out to you about that another thing is you can volunteer once the programs are up and running in those Arenas but that requires you to get yourself in a position to serve am listen carefully to this everybody needs to hear this if you you want to volunteer to shovel the snow after a blizzard here at the church you can come and volunteer and you can smell like weed and be a stoner I mean for real we'll still hand you a shovel we might even leave you out there by yourself cuz you won't know the difference but if you want to Mentor my teenage daughter you better get yourself right with God and you better be pure as the driven snow listen we're not playing we're not playing if you want to be Peter for the beggar then let Jesus authentically change your life stop fooling around stop being entrapped by the things of this world and the Trinkets and the the tokens and the totems of this world allow Jesus to authentically transform your life because we got work to do and you need to be part of it you see I believe God wants to use you to facilitate change on the earth we already know most of us in the room already understand what that means but you got to let God take care of the deal the baggage and the junk you got to let it happen you got to turn it over to Jesus and so that's how you can get ready that's how you get ready to serve Pastor I just want to volunteer I've been clean for three and a half minutes it's not going to cut it not really hey Pastor you know I want to like work with teenagers and Mentor them but you like on the side you're involved with all kinds of hustles and Street thinking that's not going to cut it we got to raise up a generation that prospers we got to raise up a gener a generation that has polls permits and ponds another way that we can help is we can financially contribute that should be quite obvious this isn't a government thing this is a church thing we've actually opened up a giving category called El Centro in our church Center app and this is part of our overall Legacy strategy and this is just a way that we can help make this happen together so for those of you that need to know this the all-in cost of this project is not cheap between the purchase of the property the renovations and the launch of the program is going to be about $1.5 million now now for those of you that just lost the wind in your sale right there that you lost your breath I just want you to know um you should not be surprised because the world is not free and the world doesn't work that way even though it is a free country it does not mean that okay we now just so you know we already have some of this budgeted so for those of you that have just recently started giving here at the church or you're just learning how to give please don't like move your giving from where you're giving now to this because we've already budgeted it to help with this project okay for those of you that are looking for a unique or special project to help fund this is something that I believe is worth making a commitment to okay so here's here's the ask for you for now I just want you to pray I want you to talk to your family about how you might be able to contribute either in a one-time significant gift or on a regular continuing basis that's what I want you to do I'll be doing this with my family as well about what we can do", "[Applause] I love that hello East Coast International Church glad to see you it's a joy to be here with you a privilege to have the opportunity to share with you the sermon today so I just thank you for the opportunity to speak to you I want to thank Pastor Kurt for the chance he's not here but maybe he'll watch online I don't

you're right here with us we thank you God that you want to speak that you want to move that you're interested in working with us God we thank you for your word and we just pray that you would take this time and that you would impress on each of our hearts and our Spirits what you want to speak to us through this message God I just invite you and we invite you God with open ears and Open Hearts we just say come and speak we love you Jesus and we pray these things in your name amen amen today we're going to talk about putting your faith in Jesus from the book of Genesis today's story is Rich it has layers on layers of meaning and it also raises a lot of questions it's set in the Middle East roughly 4 000 years ago that's a long time just think about that for a second four thousand years ago and it starts off with God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son yikes okay so before we jump into that I want to share with you a little sociological spiritual quandary as we get started when I was growing up I lived on um I lived on an island nation I lived on an island in a country called Vanuatu for a while and I lived on a main island where the capital city was but I learned about the island called Pentecost Pentecost Island was known in Vanuatu as being the most hostile towards Outsiders and in Pentecost the prevailing belief system is animism animism is when you believe that there are different spirits that govern over different parts of Nature and so basically while you're living out there in these tropical rainforest Islands if you want to survive you got to make sure you appease the spirits so can you guess which spirit is most worshiped on the island of Pentecost yep you guessed it the yam spirit I knew I knew you would guess it and do you know what makes the yam spirit so happy that it gives you a big old yams you guessed it bungee jumping that is what the yams I knew you guys I knew it's like an easy guess I knew you would get it so bungee jumping that's what these people do you see right there okay it's not exactly bungee jumping it's actually a ritual called land diving but it's where the idea for bungee jumping came from so every year these people build a really tall tower and all of the men of the village jump off of it when I say men I'm talking about all of the males who are old enough to be become men to considered old enough to become men and if I don't want to that starts around the age of nine nine years old so every guy nine years old and up will climb the tower the women they sing and they dance and they're providing you know support from the ground and the men climb the tower they tie Vines to their ankles and they dive and supposedly the higher the jump and the closer to the ground you go the more pleased the spirit of the yam Harvest is right their goal is actually a really good dive is the people that go last that go from the very top of the tower and their goal is to brush the ground with their shoulders when they when they hit the bottom right so yeah that's it's wild it's really fascinating Oprah did a little highlight video on this where she commented on how amazing it is that these people have such strong belief that they literally take a leap of faith and it's true they have faith but I personally am a little disturbed by the spirit that they worship people are injured during this ritual right sometimes people die sometimes people sustain mental injuries or physical injuries that last for the rest of their lives it's not all the time but it's strange to me how this God likes it for people to take their lives put their lives at risk it's crazy to think that there are people all around the world that are worshiping gods that ask for Human Sacrifice worse yet to think of kids being sacrificed for these gods but if you reflect on it I think you'll find that it's a lot more common and even more familiar than we might realize though it looks different in different places and in different times in history but today's story we're traveling back to a time when child sacrifice was a typical way that people worshiped maybe a god demanded it as this ultimate sign of loyalty or maybe a person offered their child as a way to ask for ongoing fertility from their God during a time when child mortality rates were through the roof or perhaps the great value or innocence of these small humans made them somehow more powerful components in whatever ritual they were used for to the modern listener these things sound like they come out of a horror movie but four thousand years ago this was a way of life this story in the Bible gives us an opportunity to ask some tough questions is our God like that selfish abusive judging arbitrarily or rigidly is he comfortable with consuming Human Resources just for his sheer pleasure does he care when we get hurt I want you to keep those questions in mind as we navigate the story this story that's really about putting your faith in Jesus Genesis chapter 21 22 starts off by saying sometime later God tested Abraham's faith what was God testing Abraham's faith Abraham God called yes he replied here I am take your son your only son yes Isaac whom you love so much and go to the land of Mariah go and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will show you the next morning Abraham got up when he got up early as the story progresses here Abraham gives us a world-class demonstration of faith Abraham did not allow a fence to hold him back did you know that God can be really offensive God can be really offensive okay the whole idea of getting saved is based on the premise that you're lost to begin with right and all throughout scripture scripture God goes on to presume his role he repeatedly says that everything belongs to him that he alone determines what is right and what's true and that we are blessed when we are obedient to him and to top it off God is constantly trying to warn us about the flip side of all of this when we disobey him and when we try to run our own lives or when we act like we don't need him he warns us that we always end up in a mess of sin and death and here enters death into Abraham's story I would have been offended but Abraham was not he did not allow offense to hold him back instead he put obedience to God before his own interests So Not only was Isaac his precious son he was also the Avenue that God had promised to use to give Abraham a blessing a lasting Legacy so Abraham's interests are completely invested in Isaac and God is testing him by asking him to sacrifice Isaac and Abraham obeys he even got up early the next morning to start obeying the story makes it very clear that Abraham trusted God's words Hebrews 11 19 gives us a little insight it says Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died God was able to bring him back to life so this isn't Abraham just taking some kind of punishment he actually believes he's confident that God is somehow going to pull through and be the good god of his promise Abraham goes so far as to tell his servants and even Isaac we will be back and God will provide the offering but even more important than his words of faith Abraham obeyed God see faith is much more than a warm fuzzy feeling sometimes we talk about it like that right like if you just believe the magic of Christmas will light the way you know we talk about faith in these Hallmark terms and these kids movies and whatever but the faith of the Bible is inherently linked to action we believe that what God says is true and it compels us to live a certain way sometimes we call this saving Faith so for example if my saving Faith was in this chair I would go beyond simply saying that chair exists do you get what I'm saying like how some people say oh yeah I believe in God right I would go beyond saying I believe that that chair truly exists the faith of the Bible goes beyond saying I believe that the chair can hold me up and save me it even goes beyond saying I trust that when I do sit in that chair it will save me saving faith is completed when I act upon my trust when I sit in the chair faith is followed by faithfulness that's why those people on the island of Pentecost they dive off a tower because they really have faith in the spirit of the Yale Harvest that that spirit is going to give them good yams so the faith of the Bible in other words looks like when you put your money where your mouth is and you act like someone who trusts God's character by obeying what he says and Abraham did exactly that God told him something that sounded pretty crazy but Abraham knew it was God speaking and he even woke up early the next day to begin following through on what God Said to do he didn't drag his feet he just obeyed maybe you need to hear this today when we let our offenses get in the way when we say we love God but we set our priorities without his input when we refuse to trust his goodness or to obey his commands we miss out on the blessings now what blessings I can hear you thinking what blessings right like God is asking Abraham to sacrifice his son no God wants Abraham to be full of faith God's not after Isaac's death he's after Abraham's faith he's testing Abraham's Faith why because God wants to build something with you and he wants your cooperation to do it one of the reasons why I'm so convinced that God is beautiful and good is because I've seen him painting self-portraits Divine self-portraits in the lives of people all around me throughout my whole life when I was a kid I spent some time living on a bible school campus and I used to run around like a wild child getting into mischief and I remember that there was this one student who was significantly older than the other Bible school students and he used to scold me sometimes I used to think he was he's just a grouchy man that's so sad for him that he cannot handle you know a little fun here and there but I learned a little bit more about him later and it surprised me and it stuck with me he had come from a more rural more remote island and he was older and in Bible school with a bunch of young men in unfamiliar territory unfamiliar living arrangements it was uncomfortable for him for sure but worst of all he had left behind a wife and kids that were waiting for him to come back home he didn't really want to be at bible college but he had heard the gospel and he'd been so moved by Jesus that he had a burning desire to go and get as much as he could to bring it back to his family and his people on the island where he lived there was no Pastor there was no access to education there was no resource and there were a lot of people that didn't know anything about Jesus so even though sometimes he was grouchy he was growing and he set an example for all of us with his commitment to God he was like a living parable of someone who found the kingdom of heaven and sold everything that he had to go get it Jesus used to tell Parables about this right but I got to meet a guy a living breathing man whose life painted that picture for me when Abraham and Isaac were living this story they were becoming a picture of something that God wanted to show Humanity and this picture this story is so deep and so Central to the Bible's message we call it prophetic reenactment they sent a message to the world at the Pinnacle of Abraham's Faith story that Jesus was coming and that God is everything that we hope he is every is everything that we hope he is you can see the parallels in Jesus story both Isaac and Jesus are long-awaited beloved sons who are born in miraculous circumstances both sons carry the wood that is to be the instrument of their deaths on their backs can you imagine Isaac carrying this wood up a mountain that he's supposed to be burnt on can you see Jesus carrying the cross that they nailed him to Isaac went on a three-day journey to his death and Jesus spent three years in Ministry that culminated in his death well it didn't culminate there it didn't end there thank God but this kind of spiritual picture this kind of spiritual picture it's something that you can't force the canvas of your life is too big for you to paint on when we try to force out the image of God in our own efforts we can only eek out a distorted depiction do you know somebody who's tried to do this sometimes we try we try really hard so often though we slip away from trying to be like God into trying to be God but our job is just to trust and obey God let God weave the story that he wants to tell with your life he can only do it if you let him so don't try to be God and don't even worry about the canvas of your life just step by step try to be like Abraham was in this story at the end of the story it becomes clear that Jesus is the hero Abraham was a man of Faith yes but it was God who made the ultimate sacrifice and won the day for Abraham and Isaac so there's Abraham he's standing there with a knife in his hand over Isaac who has been tied and placed on top of the wood it's a picture of a cosmic predicament of humanity we are on the chopping block in Hebrews 22 11 says at that moment the angel of the Lord called to him from Heaven Abraham Abraham yes Abraham replied here I am don't lay a hand on the boy the angel said do not hurt him in any way for now I know that you truly fear God you have not withheld from me even your son your only son and right then Abraham sees a ram caught in a bush and exactly as he told Isaac it was a ram that he offered to God I can just imagine Abraham with tears in his eyes untying his son holding him close and Abraham named that mountain Yahweh yude or you might be for more familiar with Jehovah Jireh which means the Lord will provide and that's the amazing message of the Bible that ever since we lost our faith in God all the way back in the Garden of Eden Humanity lost access to eternal life and we got stuck with sin and death and all the nasty consequences that they bring but that God has seen our predicament and that he will sacrifice himself to provide a solution and all he wants from us is to come back to faith in him in 2020 a song came out called the story I'll tell by Maverick City and I was drawn to it shortly after that David and I experienced a loss in our lives and I remember going to Red Rock Park together and and he went for a walk and I just sat on the bench and I listened to that song on repeat and it helped me to keep my eyes on Jesus and then just over a year later when I was giving birth on agile and I were having medical complications and David turned that song on for me and it helped me keep my eyes on Jesus then too and I just want to read a couple of the lyrics to you says believing gets hard when options are few when I can't see what you're doing I know that you're proving you're the God who comes through and oh but I know that over the years I'll look back on this moment and see your hand on it and know you were here and I'll testify of the battles You've Won how you were my portion when there wasn't enough I'll testify of the Seas that we have crossed the waters you parted the waves that I've walked and I love my Jesus he has never left me he was trustworthy in my loss and grief he was trustworthy in that hospital room when it was touch and go he's been my peace and he keeps breathing life into me even in low moments and honestly I'm just scratching at the tip of my testimonies of how good my God has been to me but you don't have to just take my word for it you can look at the lives of men and women all around the world to be honest with you so far my life has been really really good I've had a really blessed privileged awesome life I haven't gone through a lot of hard things the hard things I've gone through might not hold a candle to the things you've been through but there are people all over the world who have gone through crazy stuff some of you are right here in this room people who have been persecuted for their faith people who have lost everything even their own lives and at the end of the day what is it that they want to talk about they want to talk about the goodness of Jesus at the end of the day are they focused on the bad things that happen or is the thing that emerges from their story how awesome God's character is how faithful and how good the end of the day that's the story I'm going to be telling whenever I'm in a situation where my faith is tested it always ends with him being proved faithful and that's exactly what happened with Abraham this is why the New Testament authors called Jesus the Lamb of God they were pointing right back to this story when God made sure that the lamb the ram took Isaac's place in the sacrifice the story even alludes to the resurrection that Jesus gives to those who trust and Obey him Hebrews says in a manner of speaking Abraham did receive Isaac back from death I'd like to look at John 10 10 to 11 together at the beginning of the message we asked a few questions right is God bad is he selfish abusive judging arbitrarily or rigidly is he comfortable with our pain does he want human sacrifice I think you can see from the story the answers are resounding no God is good and we can trust him Jesus says it so beautifully he said a thief is only there to steal and kill and destroy I came so they can have real and eternal life more and better life than they've ever dreamed of I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd puts the Sheep before himself sacrifices himself if necessary I'd like to invite the worship team up this time for me there's often a temptation to grow frustrated with God why isn't he doing what I want him to do and I'm not talking about frivolous things I'm not talking about material or Comfort items I'm going to talk about superficial or self-centered things I'm talking about good things that I want for you things that I want for my loved ones I'm talking about breakthroughs and people getting healed and families being restored and things that I'm pretty sure God wants too I really want God to just step in and fix things already but this story reminds me that God is doing things behind the scenes and way above my pay grade that I cannot do I need to remind myself from time to time that he is good and he is faithful and he's God and I am not I need to remember that my greatest achievement will be to believe that he is who he says he is and to live accordingly sometimes you gotta stop looking at everything around you just take stock of yourself where are you at with God today where's your heart with God today where's your faith would you stand to your feet with me if you would just take a moment to reflect on your own situation I've got a couple questions have you allowed yourself to become suspicious of God or distant toward him have you allowed yourself to blame him for things that someone else did or things that you wish she had done but hasn't are you at risk of losing your faith won't you take this moment as we worship to come and pray and let him remind you that he is a good shepherd and that he will take good care of you if you let him won't you come in this time of prayer and renew your faith you can pray God I don't know what's going to happen next but I believe that you are totally good and I'm going to reset my focus on obeying your instructions to me maybe you really struggle to let your walls down and Trust and even with God you find that difficult I just want you to know it's okay because God can meet you right where you're at and he can build your faith up with you foreign I don't really read the Bible much and I don't hear from God so I don't really know what this has to do with me I just want to invite you to start a journey of spiritual exploration because God's got a lot of things he wants to say to you and you're gonna miss out if you don't take the time to listen this is a great place to start a journey of spiritual exploration we can get you a Bible and as you keep coming to church you'll learn more wherever you're coming from today Let the Good Shepherd Jesus keep leading you to full life I want to welcome you to come and pray at the altar as we", "[Music] hey welcome back to our week of prayer and fasting and today we're looking at this idea of expect a reward and it comes to us from the gospel of matthew chapter 6 verse 6. this is what it says but when you pray go away by yourself shut the door behind you and pray to your father in private then your father who sees everything will reward you what a great reminder that expecting god to answer our prayers is not a selfish thing and i do want to highlight two important things from these verses the first one is this idea of praying in private i think this is really a counter-cultural idea because so many times our initial instinct when something major happens in our lives something important is to share with the world we want to share with our our family and our friends and the people that know us we want them to know what's going on and there's nothing intrinsically wrong with that but how many times have we come up with a need and something that is this deep desire a longing that we have a situation that is complicated and we share it with a lot of people but oftentimes we forget to share it with the very person that can do something about it that can meet our needs that can show up supernaturally and that is god our heavenly father the second thing is that oftentimes it's much easier to invite god to all the public areas of our lives and harder to invite him to the places in our lives that are hidden where all of our inner deeper struggles lay and what god wants to do is he doesn't just want to set us free but he wants to do a deep cleansing work that's why it's important to get alone with god and to sort things out before him and to let god know god i really need to share this with you i know that you know it but it's important for me to bring this up and god will meet us every time in those in those situations and it's such a powerful thing and i think this is the heart of what god is trying to say is that when we go to the private place to meet with god to be with god to walk with god god is able to really address some of those things that we are longing to have addressed that we're really suffering the things that we have been longing for for a very long time and so today i want to pray for you and let's really pray and ask god invite god to be with us today in those private moments where nobody's looking nobody's knowing exactly what's going on in our lives but god knows and we know that we need to talk with our heavenly father let's pray heavenly father we thank you today for your grace and your mercy thank you for being a loving god thank you for all of the wonderful things that you are doing in and around us with our family with our friends in our own lives god and god we really come to you from a place of humility knowing that you are wanting to meet with us today in the secret place in a private moment where we can step aside and really tell you what's going on that we can be transparent fully and that you can rush in and extend your mercy and your grace so god i just pray that today for all the people that are watching this that you would meet them in that secret place and that you would reward them god that every one of their prayers is being heard even that person that is suffering in in private there are sicknesses that maybe nobody knows about and needs that nobody knows about god you know exactly what it is that you want for that person and i pray for your freedom and your healing and your power to come to them and to meet them god because we know that you are a loving father and you want to get to the deepest parts of who we are god you don't want us to pretend you don't want to talk to a fake version of ourselves but you love us just as we are and we thank you for that and we love you in jesus name we pray amen", "that was about first John which is one of the books that we are reading this month so this month we are reading through James and first John you have just a few days left in the month to catch in the good news is both of those books are very short so if you haven't started yet you can go ahead and start so we read through James earlier this month and now through first John and so that gives you some insight into what first John is all about right there we're going to jump right into our message today this is part three and our last message in our financial ethics in the Kingdom series and so far in this series we have tackled the following we talked about the biblical mandate to work and to create opportunities for others to work we've also walked through the need for us each and every one to use wisdom in our finances and to prepare for the future so those are really important uh parts that we've covered so far now for many years I have in my reading plan I read quite a bit every year and I between Thanksgiving and Christmas or Thanksgiving in the new year I try to read two Financial books each year and so I've been doing this for at least 20 years so I've read a lot of different Financial books I've read distinctively Christian books from a Biblical worldview and I've read some other books that are definitely not Christian books uh that are and the the good ones are extremely ethical and god-centered but then there's another group of financial books that tell you to just take advantage of people and be self-centered they don't say it like that but that's what they mean today we're going to talk about money a little bit and we're going to have what I would call a family chat okay this is me wanting to make sure that each and every one of you have the ability and opportunity to prosper in every area of your life you see the scripture has a lot to say about all the areas of our life it talks to us about our spiritual spiritually emotionally relationally and financially the Bible gives Crystal Clear instructions in each of those areas if you want to prosper in that area of your life the Bible has much to say about that area so today as we wrap up our financial series I am hopeful for you that you will begin to experience greater provision in your life because when God's people experience greater provision it translates into greater impact on the world around us God does in fact want to bless you tell your neighbor God wants to bless you now there's always got to be somebody that's super cynical and they're like does God really want to bless you yes yes he does he wants to bless you in fact go back to the beginning there's a contract a promise a covenant that God makes with a gentleman named Abraham that we get to benefit from even to this day and here's the promise in Genesis chapter 12 verse 12. the Lord had said to Abram leave your native country your relatives and your father's family go to the land I will show you I will make you into a great nation I will bless you and make you famous and you will be a blessing to others I will bless those who bless you curse those who treat you with contempt and all the families on Earth I love that all the families on Earth will be blessed through you now in case you didn't know this all Christians are spiritual Sons and Daughters of Abraham the one that God made that promise to and God wants to bless you so that you can join his mission to be a blessing to the whole world he wants to show off with you Jesus said this you are the light of the world like a city on a Hilltop that cannot be hidden you should be living brightly we should be living brightly in the midst of a very very very very very dark World letting our light shine for all to benefit from it you see God's heart for his people is clearly generous but it is not just for his people his heart is for the whole world and he wants to use his people to bless the whole world once when Israel was overthrown and the people were displaced in captivity to Babylon God said this to his people now remember God is telling them to do something in their enemy's City Jeremiah 29 he says work for the peace and prosperity of the city meaning Babylon where I set you into Exile pray to the Lord for it for its welfare will determine your welfare God's saying hey make sure that you pray that I bless the city you're in because that'll benefit you too it's interesting I just want you to keep some of those core thoughts in your mind as we go through the rest of the message today I recently received a wedding invitation it was the normal language of a traditional wedding invitation Pastor Curtin Chen it would be our honor you know things like that we are honored to have you join us with us on a special day we join our lives together right so this is exciting exciting moment in our life and they are inviting us to join with them in their life Journey it's a it's a really interesting this idea of wedding invitations I'm going to ask you this thought I'm going to wrestle with this thought have you ever sent God an invitation into your life think about that he probably didn't have his address but you might not have sent it like that if you ever invited God into your life or into particular areas of your life God has already invited you into his life God sent the ultimate invitation in Jesus life death and resurrection and he invites us all into his family so a couple of questions one ask yourself have I accepted God's invitation into his life and if not what's the hold up is there maybe there's a real question maybe there's a real answer to that and you're wrestling with it second have you ever invited God into the different areas of your life maybe there's an area of your life that you need to have made us all the areas of your life but maybe there's one particular that you're holding out on specifically today let's think about this in the financial area of your life God gives us super clear instructions on how to invite him into our finances so if you wondered how to do that pay attention Malachi 3 10. it says bring all the tithes somebody say tithes it's an unusual word we don't say it a lot ties into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my temple if you do says the Lord of Heaven's armies I will open the windows of Heaven for you I will pour out a blessing so great you won't have enough room to take it in try it put me to the test your crops will be abundant for I will guard them from insects and disease your grapes will not fall from the vine before there are ripe says the Lord of Heaven's armies the word tithe literally means a tenth of or ten percent of one's earning or production meaning if you have a hundred bushes of bushels of corn that you get then you give 10 bushels of corn to the storehouse or the temple or today it would be the church if you make a hundred dollars you give ten that's the idea so this is God's plan to bless us in order to be a blessing to others how does that work ultimately when we follow God's plan it prospers the kingdom of God It ultimately prospers the communities that we live in and It ultimately prospers the individual believer so it prospers everything to avoid doing this is to hinder is to stand in the way of what God wants to do it hinders the prospering of the Kingdom the prospering of the community and the prospering of the individual how in the world could I hinder the kingdom why not like it's kind of an odd thought that you can hint but you can I want you to throw away back we already mentioned it earlier when Babylon overthrew Israel was in 586 they tore down the temple Babylon came in it was a horrible thing to do and they they tore down the temple and they gathered up the people of the nation and they SCA they took them to Babylon some some ran away some scattered but and over the centuries they began to be sent out and they landed in different places and what they did was they would go out in groups along Syria and turkey think the Mediterranean Greece and all of those areas and these these groups of of of men and women of God these groups of Jewish faithful Jewish people would gather wherever they landed and they would find each other they would gather together to worship they would gather together and they would begin to implement the things that God had taught them to do one of those was tithing and what they would do when they gathered together was they would eventually build a synagogue A Gathering Place that lots of different things would happen at including worship so there's all these synagogues that were being built during this time period before Jesus shows up on the scene now why is that important to us what's important to us today because after Paul became convinced of who Jesus was he went out and he began to go to these these places we just talked about around Syria and turkey and Greece and he would go to the synagogues to speak to people about who Jesus was so he would go to these faithful groups of men and women of God and tell them that the Messiah had arrived and he would do it in these physical places some of them were synagogues some of them were house churches they would but they would go all over the place and what was happening here is this he had a place to launch his message from wherever he went had the people not done what God had asked them to do he wouldn't have had those places it's literally something that benefits us something to people three thousand years ago or 2500 years ago people were faithful to God meant that we got to hear about Jesus today because the gospel would not have been able to expand at the rate it did without previous people being faithful to what God had asked them to do so people before us were faithful so that we could hear and we need to be faithful so that the Next Generation can hear so that's how this works okay so that's how we get involved this instruction is literally the instruction on how to invite God into our financial life it's how you also do spiritual warfare you step on the head of Mammon Mammon is the demon god of greed or money who who tries to get you to serve him instead of the one true God Jesus once said no one can serve two masters for you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve both God and be enslaved to money so the money there the actual word is Mammon it's an actual reference to this demon of greed you're like wow that's that's some pretty heavy stuff there Pastor Kirk yep we get to do spiritual warfare when we invite God into our finances you might think to yourself oh Pastor Kurt you have no idea how bad my financial situation is let me assure you I know exactly how bad it is I have sat down with hundreds of people and worked with them on their budgets in fact today I want to make sure that if you are wrestling with this right now go to moneycanvas.com and sign up it's a hundred percent free from beginning to end it will not cost you anything and they will help you personalize a budget for you if you have heard me talk at all in the last three years you have heard me mention moneycanvas.com a hundred times because it's that important and those of you that have gone through it it has been tremendously beneficial for you so this is just a tool to help you do the things that we're talking about doing today it's interesting to me that the verse in Malachi starts off and says bring all the word all is interesting to me because I think it assumes that we are human beings and that we have a way of trying to get around anything like we self-deceive ourselves all the time we we lie to others so much that we lie to ourselves thinking that what we told the other people was true so when it says bring all its meaning so so you don't just do part of the way you go all the way now listen I've been a pastor for over 30 years I've heard nearly every reason Under the Sun for why people who are wrestling with this will explain why they are the most unique person in the history of humanity and why they can't possibly do something that God has clearly said they can do the first I want you to know this I am rooting for you on this issue I don't personally gain from you deciding to trust God with this like I don't get a raise if you do this I don't personally benefit from this I stand up here knowing that this is complicated for most of you to hear and my gain is that I get to Rejoice with you when you finally engage in this area of your life that's my game is your obedience second I want you to hear my heart on this if you already know if you've been around the Jesus team for a while and you already know what you're supposed to be doing and you haven't done it yet there's a word for that in the Bible it's called disobedience you might have 20 reasons why you think your reasons or challenges or explanations or excuses somehow invalidate God's word but it doesn't and disobedience in the past which would mean like maybe you have a ton of debt maybe you have a ton of stuff in the way disobedience in the past does not give permission to be disobedient in the present or in the future that's a really bad spiritual idea don't hey I made a bunch of mistakes before so that means I don't follow Jesus now instead Give It All to Jesus now give yourself a fresh start make a plan be part of the cycle of blessing that God wants to Institute in your life okay so that's what God wants to do don't let all those excuses and those tricks of the enemy kind of mess with your head and if you can't figure it all out go to moneycanvas.com they'll help you there's an interesting dialogue that Jesus has with some religious folks about tithing and because it's Jesus and tithing we need to pay attention to it Matthew chapter 23 Jesus is talking to these religious guys and he says what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees hypocrites you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens so with that this picture they go to their kitchen above their sink on the windowsill they have some basil leaves growing for their summer and like pulling one Basil Leaf off one for God nine for me one for God nine for me with their basil leaves or whatever herbs it is that they happen to have over there and so Jesus is saying listen you go to all the effort to give a tenth of your herbs but you ignore the most important aspects of the law get this that means that the tithing is not the most important thing the stuff that follows are the most important things the most important things are Justice and mercy and faith Jesus continues you should tithe yes but do not neglect the more important things which were Justice and mercy and faith here we learn this tithing is the starting point but we have greater things to address in our life so don't get stuck on tithing so take care of the little things tithing so we can do the big things Justice mercy and faith don't neglect the small things because if you neglect the small things you won't be able to do the great things also just because you did the small thing doesn't mean you should only do the small thing you should also do the big thing there's a lot going on with that little comment that Jesus made now I got some really exciting news I've been waiting to share this with you since yesterday I went to the gas station I put gas in my car that's it no standing ovation come on okay okay I got more I got more on Friday when I woke up I went outside there was like six inches of ice on my windshield not really it was a lot of ice though and I scraped the ice off my windshield no Awards no trophies no accolades no Pomp and Circumstance big brass band coming in you filled up your car with gas Pastor good job do not ever do that all right all right why because some things are just supposed to be normal I don't even tell you that I filled up my car with gas although I scraped the ice off my windshield because if I want to drive the car that's what you have to do that's what you do it's a normative starting point we don't give gold medals out to people for putting on their shoes and eating breakfast before they leave the house if you left the house this morning and didn't put your shoes on you got some cold feet and if you start to put shoes on afterwards we're still not going to cheer for you because that's just what you do you put your shoes on before you leave the house that's what tithing is it's just normative starting point for your life and faith it's the financial starting point it's the normative and Orthodox expression of the church it's a standard for the faithful but tithing is the Lesser thing so you can become and do the greater things but it's still the starting thing so don't get it twisted one way or the other now tucked into the middle of the Malachi Passage is this expression that God says try it put me to the test try it put me to the test are we testing God to see if we can get all the goodies that follow not really that's not the real point we're testing God to see if God can be trusted if God is who he says he is you see if God is not who he says he is then this is all messed up it's literally the only place like this in the Bible the other parts of the Bible tell us not to test God because it's considered uh sinful and arrogant however with our Resources with money with stuff it shows up different because this is the voluntary free will act that must reject a lying demonic God of Mammon it is US humbly surrendering ourselves our very uh thing that helps us like do life it's us surrendering that to the author of the universe and here we have even though God is saying go ahead and test me it's really an invitation from God into relationship it's God declaring hey I can be trusted it's God inviting you to trust him it's God saying with great confidence I am exactly who I say that I am tithing cuts through all the fancy language tithing cuts through the theological debates and tithing helps us to answer the question is God who he says that he is and when we get past this most basic of hurdles it gives us a great freedom to get to work on the much more important matters in the Kingdom Justice and mercy this is ultimately about trust ing that God is good he can be fully trusted you see trust is complicated because we don't trust people easily we live in a fallen and broken and chaotic world we don't trust we don't trust our systems and structures we don't trust anybody but God says try it test me why so we can trust him this message is really not really about money it's really a message about trust can you trust that God is who he says that he is so let me ask you as the media team gets ready for this video let me ask you today where are you at with that where are you at in your trusting of God what does that look like for you and let me ask you do you right now do you trust that God is who he says that he is these are deep questions they hit right all the way at the center of Who We Are we're gonna play a video here and I want you as you're listening to the song I just want you to reflect and think about this in your own life on a scale of one to ten where are you at in your trust of God maybe in the next few moments you could begin to talk to God right from where you're at about taking a journey of trust with him in all the areas of your life let's", "for those of you who don't know me I am Pastor Dave I'm so glad you're here and uh can we just take a moment we don't usually do this but you just stand for just one moment and high-five somebody around you and say welcome to the house of God I'm glad to be worshiping with you glad you're here you made it awesome awesome you got to take that win you got to take that win when you come out and we praise God together things are happening amen amen thank you you may be seated it's really a privilege for me to be sharing the word of God with you today I receive greetings from my beautiful wife Pastor Emily and my lovely daughter Anna jail and uh amen and please continue to play Pray for pastor Kurt as he's away and you know when you're on vacation you never know what's going to happen and we just want to pray that God would use this time to refresh Pastor Kurt in his life to give him fresh vision and to be remembering him in your prayers amen so over the next few weeks we're going to be exploring the Book of Genesis amen today we're talking about one of its Central figures and certainly one of the key figures in all of Christianity Abraham amen Abraham I love Abraham now why is it a general understanding of Genesis so important for us in our present time well if you're like me you get home you turn on the television and have you noticed how jacked up the world is I mean there's just so much going on and if you've ever thought to yourself why is our world so messed up well I got to tell you this every major conflict being wrestled with today in our personal lives and you know on the on the news and in the world can be traced back to Genesis at the same time the answers to some of our most important questions can also be found there and if you're newer with us and are exploring Christianity Genesis gives you a framework for understanding why Jesus matters and in fact Jesus himself often referenced Genesis in his teaching to bring clarity about his mission and to realign us with God's original intent for the world in the beginning and so that's what we're going to look at in just to give you an example of what that looks like one day at Jesus is having this heated discussion with a crowd of his own Jewish people at this point in his ministry Jesus is about to drop a major truth bomb on them about who he really is because so far he's been you know extremely guarded about his words and where he's at and you know how much he shares but as a result of what's about to be revealed shots are about to be fired it's going to go down right so we look at John chapter 8 Jesus here talking he says your father Abraham somebody say Abraham now the Jewish people you know they don't have chapters and and verses like we do so back in the day you just kind of started quoting something or started talking about someone and everybody knew in this moment okay he's talking about Genesis and he's talking about Abraham which is in Genesis so we we know where he's at and so Abraham was a man who lived 16 100 years before these words are being spoken and so Jesus is telling them your father Abraham your ancestor rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming he saw it and was glad and the people said you aren't even 50 years old how can you say you have seen Abraham that's a good question you never thought about that Jesus answered I tell you the truth before Abraham was even born I am amen amen and at that point they picked up stones to throw at him but Jesus was hidden from them and left the temple seems kind of harsh right seems kind of harsh you say something like that they want to kill you uh but what's going on here is that God Jesus is revealing himself to be the god of Abraham he's outright claiming to be God Jesus is saying I am God that you can hear Echoes of Exodus I am that I am he says I am and uh he so he's claiming to be more than just a nice teacher uh more than just a prophet more than an angel he's saying I am God that's what's happening at the same time he's telling these people who held Abraham in high honor and who kind of wore that as a badge of honor like like we're the children of Abraham where his lineage he's telling them hey the guy you all claim to venerate I'm actually closer to him than you are uh because I am the one who actually called Abraham and in fact I'm the one Abraham was living his life for and I am the Fulfillment of all of Abraham's wildest dreams Abraham was looking forward to my arrival and here I am and so they were not ready to hear that so they try to kill him so that's what's going on there and but it's important for us to understand that Jesus for Jesus understanding Genesis and the life of Abraham were essential for Understanding God's role in human history and so I would encourage you as we walk through Genesis this would be a great time to ask questions about Genesis if you've never thought about the Bible on a really deeper level this is a great opportunity to do that amen all right so today's topic is protect the promise tell your neighbor protect the promise now but say like you mean it protect your promise when God gives us a promise the devil will try with all his power to destroy it and to cause us to give up on the promise before it's time and we have to be diligent about protecting the promise how many of you know that that when God gives you a dream when God gives you a promise the devil will stop at nothing to come after your promise and to get you to give up to quit to stop what you're doing and to focus on other things sometimes you'll bring distraction but he doesn't want you to keep on waiting on God and so in comes Abraham and just so you understand kind of how important Abraham is to the to the biblical story what we have at the beginning is we know in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth right so God creates this good world and he establishes humans to basically manage this good World on his behalf and as long as they honor his boundaries as long as they trust him they will continue to enjoy abundance life creativity all of the good things that God created us for but then sin comes into the picture we know that right the Devil comes through the serpent and and sin enters the world and therefore death suffering corruption then begins to seep into God's good world and it becomes corrupted Adam and Eve are kicked out of that paradise that original intent that God had and and what happens next is that the world then goes into a downward spiral from being this good Planet into uh they're basically descend into chaos and suffering and selfishness and pain and and it gets so bad that God's like okay we need a we need a fresh start here and so there's the flood how many of you remember the flood the flood is a time where God basically wipes out Humanity but Noah finds favor in the eyes of God and so God spares uh Noah's family and he says okay let's give this another shot okay start over all right uh Noah you're going to be the guy who's going to I'm going to use your life to bless us the Earth and unfortunately as soon as Noah gets out of the Ark he gets drunk he makes some really poor decisions and the spiral continues right we thought it was going to get better it's actually getting worse and all of a sudden Humanity continues to be corrupt continues to be awful with one another pain suffering oppressing the poor all this all these things that break the heart of God and and not only that now they're becoming proud and all of a sudden all of these broken humans they're like you know what we need to make ourselves famous we need to make our name for ourselves we're going to build a tower and we're going to call it the Tower of Babel and we're just going to build it ourselves because we want all the good stuff all the blessing you know all of the order but we just don't want God to be in the picture so we're going to do it ourselves right that's what we often do and so and so what they do is they start building up this Tower up high into the sky but then God shows up and he confuses their language right they they're giving different languages they're no longer able to communicate the work is left undone and so they begin to disperse throughout the Earth so right after that incident where God confuses their language and and sends them away because they're trying to make a name for themselves chapter 11 and then chapter 12 Abraham shows up in the picture and now God is saying I'm going to choose someone that I'm going to bless and I'm going to make his name great and I'm going to bless the whole world and this is how God begins to unravel his rescue plan for the world he begins to roll out the red carpet so to speak for Jesus this is how it all begins and the way he begins this this plan is is by choosing a man and he chooses Abraham he chooses one person that he's going to start fulfilling this promise to make things right to restore humans back to God's original intent and so God had given Abraham a promise and we find this in Genesis chapter 12 and listen to what God tells Abraham he tells them leave your country your family and your father's home for a land that I will show you he doesn't tell him where he's going I'll show you the land don't worry about that I'll make you a great nation I'll bless you I'll make you famous and you'll be a blessing I'll bless those who bless you and those who curse you I'll curse all the families of the earth will be blessed through you that sounds amazing now if God give me that promise I'd be like yes Lord I receive yes Lord there is only one problem with that promise is that when Abraham receives This Promise these 75 years old and not only that but him and his wife are Barren they're not able to have any children and so and not only that but then Abraham's family they're also Idol worshipers they're following false gods there was nothing literally nothing special about Abraham it's almost as if God is trying to make a point that if he can work with Abraham he can work with anybody Abraham had nothing to offer God and God says this is the man that I'm going to use to bless the whole world I want to be good to somebody says God and I'm going to choose Abraham friends this should encourage you today that it doesn't matter where you come from it doesn't matter what you've been through it doesn't matter what the challenges are that you are facing when God gives you a promise he will bring it to pass God can work with you God can move in your life in a powerful way and so the story continues and you know we see that since the creation of The World God has been looking for someone who will partner with him to bring about his good plans to bless the world and so now Abraham has to make a choice is he going to believe God is he going to trust God because you you have to be thinking right if you're Abraham wait wait a minute I'm 75 years old I have no children God how are you going to do this so he has to make a choice is he going to believe is he going to follow is he going to step out in faith even when it doesn't make any sense or is he going to stay in his comfort zone and thankfully for all of us he steps out he believes God before he has the promise he believes it so so that's Genesis 12. and now we fast forward a little bit to Genesis 15 and by this time a lot has happened uh Abraham you know first of all he gets to this land that God told him to go to and it turns out that when he gets there it's occupied there's other people living there like oh great God you brought me here and it's not there's people living here and there's so much that God is preparing Abraham for he's on an adventure following God and then in Genesis 15 we get to this this part of the story that is so fascinating in in verse 15 it says some time later everybody say some time later the Lord spoke to Abram this before God changed his name Abram in a vision and said to him do not be afraid Abram for I will protect you and your reward will be great amen now it says sometime later and you know whenever you're reading the Bible and you you notice things like that a lot of times the Bible is just trying to summarize the events but there's a lot happening in that sometime later okay we know when we read the story that there was a long time in between and um today I want to talk to you about three things that we have to guard our promise from God has given you a dream God has given you a promise there's three things generally speaking in this story that that jumped out at me because there are things that come to attack our promise and and here's the first thing the first thing that we need to protect our promise from is discouragement we have to protect our promise from discouragement by learning how to wait on God somebody say waiting on God we have to learn how to wait on God when I was 18 my dad would often take us to Florida for vacation and we would drive down especially during this time of the year and we'd be down there for Fourth of July week in our Orlando Florida we'd hang out at the beach and we'd visit some theme parks and you know I've never been a big fan of theme parks in fact you know my general uh you know way of operating is if it can kill you I tend to stay away from it right if you're if you're like me you know I just I've just never been a fan of roller coasters or anything but my favorite theme park was one where they had the turkey leg vendors how many of you know what I'm talking about the the turkey leg vendors have you ever seen a big giant turkey leg that's the best that was my favorite part of the trip and I couldn't wait to get there and one of my favorite things to do was to grab a map you know you're entering the park and you get a map and you would see I would count how many stops there were before we got to the turkey leg station and you know I was okay x amount of stops and that would make the waiting easier because I knew it was coming up The Waiting didn't seem so bad and wouldn't it be nice to have a map and a schedule of when God is going to do things in our lives amen wouldn't that make your life easier or you know if you're going down to Boston on the blue line you know they tell you that there's there's a there's a countdown to when the next train is coming I wish that God would give me a countdown for his next miracle in my life right like okay it's gonna get tough here and here but God's gonna show up last minute and and and give me a miracle that would be great it would make my life so much easier Faith would be so much easier without the waiting process I'm not a big fan of waiting I like things to be done fast and as efficiently as possible but Abraham was forced to wait on his promise and we know as we continue with the account that it was about 25 years from the time that God gave Abraham the promise into the time that he actually received his promise and and Isaac was born so think about that for a moment what do you do during those years of waiting if you're Abraham and we know in hindsight what happened and we know that God was good to Abraham but but Abraham was living in the moment and walking by faith and not knowing like how much longer is it going to take and you can imagine day after day week after week month after month year after year and no promise and time was running out for Abraham and it's easy for us to get discouraged when we don't see God doing what he promised in our lives some of you might be here today and you might be asking yourself when is God going to speak to me again when is God going to heal me when is God going to give me my breakthrough when is God going to break this addiction when is God going to do a miracle in my family and we don't know when and all we have is faith because the Bible says that God's ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts that his timing is definitely not our timing we look at the scripture Psalm 27 14 for example where God says wait patiently for the Lord be brave and courageous yes wait patiently for the Lord now that sounds like a great you know social media post could get me a few likes but when I'm going through the struggle I don't want to hear that I don't want to hear wait on God am I the only one here today like I don't want to hear that but God says wait patiently yeah wait patiently for the Lord be brave and courageous yes wait patiently for the Lord because when God gives you a promise you have to protect it from discouragement a few practical tips that you know this might help someone but I would encourage you to find spiritual support while you're waiting for your promise surround yourself with like-minded people who can stand firm with you in the waiting we can encourage you who can lift you up in prayer and another thing you can do if you're not hearing what the next step is from God just keep doing the last thing that God told you to do so many times it's tempting for us to get ahead of God have you been there before trying to get ahead of God you know like I like to help God out and I like to like think of things in advance and let him know what my plan is but it's you know it never works out well but we have to trust God's plan and when God finally shows up to Abraham he tells them do not be afraid Abram for I will protect you and your award will be great when God finally speaks to Abraham after a long time he lets him know that the promise is still on the promise is still on he tells Abraham Abraham I'm still the same God Abraham I'm still the God who called you and I haven't forgotten about you and I will give you what I promised you and we need to protect our promise from that discouragement as we wait on God the second thing that we have to guard ourselves from is small thinking somebody say small thinking in order to do this we have to enlarge our vision we have to enlarge our vision of what God is who God is and what he can do now I'm so thankful today that we are celebrating graduation Sunday by the way can we give the graduates a warm Applause for all their hard work all their dedication they are enlarging their Vision they're pushing themselves there's nothing like setting a goal for yourself and aiming for something high and achieving it amen but I remember you know back in 1994 when me and my family we we migrated from Mexico to the United States and you know when you're coming from and you know underdeveloped place where where I come from in Mexico uh everything is new literally your world is being enlarged like I remember the first time I went to school and I saw a school bus that was clean that was you know on time that picked you up every day and you know my parents laugh at me because I would run up and down the bus I wanted to be jump on every seat look out every window because I couldn't believe it my mind was blown and then and then they had this thing called free lunch where they would feed you every day it was amazing and then you even you know you even had a nap time they gave you nap time at school what like it's time let's let's all take a nap right now I know some of you wish that we were doing that but no you know we were taking a nap together and we would wake up and we had toys and all this stuff I was like Amazed by this whole process and when you come from a place like that where all you know is limitations you step out beyond that it changes your life another thing that I remember from just my culture the general area where I come from is that you know every Christmas families would travel back to visit their families in Mexico and and they would bring these fancy cars you know they would work up here all year to take a nice truck over uh to Mexico show it off man you're doing great oh man that's the American dream I want to go up to the United States it didn't matter if they were drowning in debt up here What mattered is they wanted to look good right the appearance of wealth that's all we had to aim for and so uh it was fascinating to to be able to come to the United States and and learn how to overcome that with God's help but when that's all you know it's impossible to think beyond that and so God wants us today to enlarge our vision now check this out check out how God invites Abraham to enlarge his vision back in Genesis 15 chapter 2. he said but God God replied Abraham replied oh Sovereign Lord what good are all the blessings when I don't even have a son since you've given me no children Alias are of Damascus a servant in my household will inherit all my wealth you have given me no descendants of my own so one of my servants will be my Heir then the Lord said to him no your servant will not be your Heir for you will have a son of your own who will be your heir then the Lord took Abraham outside and said to him look up into the sky and count the Stars if you can that's how many descendants you will have and Abraham believe the Lord and the Lord counted him as righteous because of his faith one of the weapons that the devil uses to get us to quit on our Dream quit on our promise is fear and fear comes to destroy the promise that God has given us because Abraham is getting really honest with God and that's what I love about prayer you can be honest Abraham you know he's saying to God you know what good are all these blessings God you're blessing me here and therefore what I really want is a son isn't it crazy how God can bless us in so many areas and he's blessing you here and there and you're like God the real issue is over here you do something about this problem you know and not that I'm being ungrateful not that I'm you know telling you how to do your job God but this is the issue that I really need an intervention in but maybe it's just me but Abraham is just you know he's getting honest with God and have you ever felt that way like God why are you answering all these prayers and the prayer that I need answered the most is not being answered and so he mentions this guy aliaser of Damascus you see the longer that God is taking and answering his prayer the more that Abraham starts to come up with a worst case scenario he begins to imagine his life without a son and you know man Eleazar is going to get everything that I've worked so hard for and he's waiting on a son and every day he's waking up with that promise that God has given him but every day he looks over and all he can see is Eleazar the more time that passes the more that fear Creeps in and the devil uses that in our lives he uses fear as a tactic to get us to stop believing and I want to ask you today very frankly when it comes to God's promise in your life what is your greatest fear what is your greatest fear today what is your aliaser what is the thing that is causing you distress and I want to encourage you today to enlarge your vision enlarge your vision the vision that you have of what is possible of what God can do God's response to Abraham when Abraham is you know being honest and saying God I just don't see how you're going to do this is he takes him outside and he asks him to look up at the stars now Abraham you know he's worried about having one son but God is saying count the Stars if you can that's how many descendants I am going to give you in other words Abraham you're thinking too small here what I have for you is greater than anything you can imagine I'm going to blow your mind Abraham I'm gonna bless you I'm going to be good to you and that's God's promise for you today what you have imagined that God can do is nothing compared to what God wants to do in your life and so Abraham believes and that's accounted to him as righteous righteousness and God is revealing himself here as a god of abundance that's why First Corinthians 2 9 says no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him amen I love that verse I love that verse [Applause] no you're worried about Eleazar you're worried about the rent Bill you're worried about your job you're worried about people that don't like you you're worried about the situation but God you know he he has to pull Abraham to the side and say hey they come here lift up your eyes lift up your eyes this is how much I'm going to bless you and so today the challenge for us is to enlarge our vision we have a big God see this wasn't about Abraham wasn't it Abraham was special is that he had a big God and with big God come big promises and so how can you enlarge your vision today how can you enlarge your dream now maybe you know for you it might look like going back to school it might look like you know open up opening up a business it might look like you know stepping out in faith it might look like simply a trusting God Allowing God to do what he wants to do in your life have you ever noticed that some of the things that we worry about all the time never actually happen that just kind of weigh us down and they're just kind of looming over us and thankfully God is always faithful the last thing that we need to guard ourselves from or something that you know we see here in the story as vultures somebody say vultures have you ever seen a vulture vultures are really creepy animals I I don't care too much for them but years ago you know when I was an intern here at the church I would travel about 45 minutes to the city and I would help with our All City youth as a youth worker on Wednesday nights and I do it a few other things but you know sometimes we get right out of class and drive straight here we wouldn't be able to eat at the cafeteria and so we'd usually do a food stop and you know in those years you know money was hard to come by for me you know it was always on a tight budget but you know I would always find find some cash and was able to get something and one time I remember I was so hungry and we stopped to get burritos and you know when I got to the church you know I I had to grab some stuff from the car and I made a rookie mistake I I put the burritos on top of the car and I just turned away for a split second and a seagull came and took my burritos they they took the these devil Birds took my burritos I I wasn't protecting the promise you see I was just I was just imagining man I'm gonna tear up this burrito I'm gonna it's gonna be so good and the birds took my burrito which helps us kind of understand that we we have to be attentive to God's promise and watch watch what happens when when God is ready to confirm the promise with Abraham uh he asked Abraham for some animals for a sacrifice and this is the way that agreement and Covenants were made back in those days but in Genesis 15 9 it says the Lord told him bring me a three-year-old heifer a three-year-old female goat a three-year-old Ram a turtle dove and a young pigeon so Abraham uh Abram presented all these to him and killed them and then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the half side by side he did now he did not however cut the birds in half now check out verse 11. some vultures swooped down to eat the carcasses but Abram chased them away I don't know why but I just love that verse Abraham just chased the vultures away like hey hey get away from here I'm trying to offer a sacrifice to God here we have to wait on God we have to enlarge our vision and we have to protect our promise from the vultures as the worship team comes up here was Abraham responding to God in faith he was doing the hard work he went and prepared the animals as God told him this was an official Covenant about to be sealed by God himself this was the assurance that Abraham had been waiting for but it wasn't enough Abraham needed to stand guard and if I can be transparent with you we have a lot of vultures out there today we have a lot of devil birds that are coming to steal the promise that God has given us maybe you've been paying attention maybe you've noticed lately that there are systems and structures and thought patterns and twisted ideas being designed by the enemy to destroy what God has given us we have to stand against the enemy's tactics and it doesn't matter how awesome the promise is if we allow the vultures to come in and mess up the promise doesn't matter God has called us to be on guard what would happen if each one of us today were to stand guard for God's promise in our life if we were to say I'm going to stand guard for my promise I'm going to stand guard for my family I'm going to stand guard for my marriage I'm going to stand guard for my faith I'm going to believe God when people come against me I'm going to protect what God has given me Abraham in this moment as as he's chasing away the vultures he's contending for his promises he's contending not just for himself but for his children and his children's children he has seen the promise of God 's abundance his kindness from afar and he's getting ready to chase some vultures away and I would encourage you today you got some vultures around you you got to chase them away vultures of Gossip vultures of disunity vultures of poverty vultures of worldly thinking or materialism or apathy or sickness or confusion whatever it is we need to guard what God has given us and so would you please stand with me today Romans 4 verses 19 to 22 here's a great summary of Abraham's life from the future it says in Abraham's Faith did not weaken even though at about a hundred years of age he figured his body was as good as death and so was Sarah's womb Abraham never wavered in believing God's promise [Music] in fact his faith grew stronger I feel somebody's Faith getting stronger today I feel somebody believing God today more than ever before and this in this he brought glory to God he was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises and because of Abram's faith God counted him as righteous today I want to encourage you to think about what God has promised you think about the dream that God has placed deep in your heart and know that there may be some times of waiting there may be some times where you have to step back and enlarge your vision today there may be some vultures that you have to chase away keep your promise safe and secure but God wants to help you today so would you bow your head with me in prayer we're going to pray then the minute we're going to sing one final song together and we'd love to pray for you as well at the altar but take this time now to speak to God in your own way in your own words and just say God I hear what you're saying I want to believe in your promise today [Music] God I just pray for every person here in this room that you would give us that awareness you are a faithful God that you are good and your

comes you don't have to be ashamed to bring that to your father that your good father is there with his arms open ready for any question you have any doubt you may have bring your doubt to him and if you have unbelief will you even bring that to him will you trust that he's a good father that he won't turn away with your unbelief all right there's a man in the Bible that we read about that says I believe but help me with my unbelief so if that's you today I pray that you will praise any way in the face of your circumstance let's sing in the face of the devil that we will praise any way all

and this will bring you to the online giving portal as always thank you for being a generous giver and for helping us build the kingdom of God the scriptures describe money as God's primary rival for our devotion if that's true if the worship of money is one of the gravest dangers of the spiritual life then it's imperative to know more than a few Bible verses pulled out of context it's imperative to know the full Council of scripture on the nature of money and the source of its power some say money is simply neutral a brute tool like any other some say money's a lot like a brick bricks can break Windows they can break bone but they can also build Cathedrals you cannot blame the brick for how it's used seems simple it's not like money has a will of its own right if money is like a brick what happens when we replace the word money with the word bricks you cannot serve both God and Bricks H how hard it is for those who have bricks to enter into the kingdom of God that doesn't seem right keep your life free from the love of bricks the love of bricks is a root of all evil perhaps money isn't like a brick after all because money is more than just an object money is one a store of value and two a system of exchange it's a pathway to countless things our hearts crave we can trade money for homes and cars s and vacations for power and fame luxury and esteem money can be a tool but it can also be an idol the Bible describes money as something that flies and seduces chokes and entangles US testifies against us as though it were a spirit a false god with a will of its own to fool and enslave us Jesus calls money unrighteous the Psalms and Proverbs contrast trusting in God with trusting in wealth they warn against unrighteous means of acquiring and using wealth and against gaining so much wealth that we become arrogant and satisfied and forget our need for God the Bible even tells us that the desire for wealth is a snare that leads us into harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction in the hands of The Godly and wise money can be a tool of extraordinary good whether you have a fortune or two pennies you can convert what Jesus calls unrighteous Mamon and consecrate it for Kingdom Service transforming Earthly assets into Heavenly Treasures you can use it to serve others in amazing ways but money can also use you as it deceives and distorts seduces and enslaves so ask yourself is money your master or is it your servant is money an idol in your heart or a tool in your hand hands for the construction of the kingdom of God good good all right good morning everybody morning hey this is our third and final uh sermon in our broke series and uh we'll notice up on the screen that Pastor Jesse's account is making progress right he's he's now out of credit card debt he's got $1,000 in his emergency fund and a little bit and like and checking so he's making progress good job good job Pastor Jesse that's not true at all but that's great that's great I don't know if you've ever made a dumb financial decision I heard first service made a lot of them they said so U we I'm sure you've made a dumb financial decision or some financial decisions that you regretted um I did something stupid recently financially not the first time ever I've done something stupid financially I the the intent was good behind it I uh you know Valentine's Day was coming up and I I was doing something special and I ordered some uh tickets to go see a a show in Boston and uh with with Jen it was just you know beautiful all that kind of stuff right but you know tickets are expensive if you didn't know that and um so I bought him and so Jen says hey uh which theater is it at and I said I don't know and so I pulled up the tickets on my app and I said well it's at this theater I don't I don't remember that theater then I looked New York City not Boston I bought tickets for Broadway in in New York City didn't have enough time right it was just not going to happen I'm like you got to be kidding and then I went to how much money I did literally just preached a sermon on money and I just wasted a whole bunch of money so I'm like how can I sell these really fast it turns out there was a way for me to sell them and so instead of losing money I made 40 bucks how about [Music] that didn't get to go didn't get to go to the show uh so I'm still so anyhow anyhow that was just stupid thing but I couldn't believe it I I cannot believe that I bought tickets for New York City um so people have a way of uh lying to themselves uh we lie to ourselves a lot and people have a way of believing their own lies in fact one of the reasons that people say their lies out loud is so that they can convince themselves that it's true okay the things like I can stop whenever I want common lie I will uh I will get to it when I'm older you're older right um when when things settle down when I when I catch a breath when I get a break it's never settling down and you're not getting a break it's just for a season just for 40 years later that's a long season we believe these Li we tell ourselves Li than we believe these lies one of the major things that people lie to themselves about is money Proverbs 11 our theme verse for this series is when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of Joy through blessing of the upright a city is exalted but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed we've been talking about four choices to live a financially blessed life so far we've talked about choosing hustle over hoping that's basically just work hard choosing a plan over passion that's like getting on a budget choosing discipline over debt that's getting quieter by the second she discipline over debt radically and this is the action step was cut expenses pay down debt increase savings start to invest right those are those are the the principles there and I'm hoping that after the last couple of weeks I'm hoping you didn't just like argue with me during the week like I'm hoping like during the week you like we like Pastor Kur just doesn't understand my situ ation he has no idea what this but my real situ I know some of you thought that I never going into that Financial class I ain't never going to go to a cohort I can figure this out on my own whatever it happens to be whatever your street hustle logic is right so you know you're you're you're wrestling with it that's fine but I do hope that some of you actually attempted to do some of these things for example last week one simple Act of homework was go home and cancel one subscription amen just real simple just go cancel one subscription to something and so I'm thinking I'm pretty good at this I'm pretty good at at this stuff I I got this I don't have wasteful subscriptions in my life that would be not being a good Steward and so I'm like I I got this but just in case I should check out and see if I can actually find one more subscription to cancel so I went home and I clicked on Google Play Store my phone and I found that I had force of subscriptions and I was only using one of them I'm like you got to be kidding I cannot believe it I got three subscriptions that I am piding for so I canceled all three of them right there on a spot took just two seconds then I went to my Apple account and I said there's no way I have unused subscriptions in my Apple account turns out I had three straggler subscriptions that I'd forgotten about and now those things are dead to me I canceled them so that's six that's six so far I thought I might be lucky to find one I about six and then yesterday morning just like it was like a pride check from from Jesus I was reviewing our credit card statement and found a $19.99 charge from something that neither my wife or I have purchased anything from in years 19 like Jen did you buy something I didn't buy something did you buy something like you know what what what is going on here it turns out watch this it was a special VIP stat St that was renewed automatically for our convenience it is it is now canceled and dead to us as well so what does that mean that means I thought I had no subscriptions to cancel and I had seven so maybe you might have one okay just just maybe maybe you've never had one and that's fine so I calculated up it's just about $1,000 in savings for the next year right that adds up if you don't want 1,000 bucks savings that's up to you but I wanted it here's a few Financial things that you need to pay attention to and what the drivers are behind it right now in America 43% of students that that graduate from college or have college debt are not making their payments 43% unrelated to the pandemic 43% are not paying their payments 44.7 million Americans uh have student loans totaling $1.56 trillion that's more M like that's more more than the credit card debt so like a little over a trillion dollars in credit card debt 1.5 trillion in student loans we also have $1.3 trillion in auto loans right now right now right this very minute there are more cars uh in foreclosure or being repossessed right now than any time in history like people can't pay their for their vehicles and here's a scary one if those other things didn't scare you this other here let me scare you right now 66% of all Millennials have Z in retirement savings you're like well they're young friends the Millennials aren't young anymore they're in their 30s and 40s some of you were like I'm a millennial and he just called me old I did I did like you're getting up there okay gen Z right you know the Gen gen z's are doing better this has all kinds of problematic implications unless America just decides to immediately start doing the right thing financially which is a long shot but it's not a long shot for you because we're talking about this so why is this important spiritually because in our journey with Jesus we need to use wisdom in every area of our life including our including Financial wisdom like we need to follow the wisdom of scripture in our financial life so this is not a separate part of our life this is part of our spiritual journey so whether it be hustle over hoping plan over passion discipline over bet over debt all are basic levels these are all basic levels of being wise with money now the next choice is just as important because it really gets to the heart of the matter this next Point really captures what is going on inside of you it may seem counterintuitive to some but it is in fact an essential ingredient in living a financially blessed life and that is the fourth choice which is choose choose generosity over greed tell your neighbor choose generosity over greed choose generosity over greed this is this idea of generosity is about the correct posture of one's heart and the condition of one's heart we're supposed to watch our heart we're supposed to guard our heart you know guard your heart is a is a refrain that the parents say to their children or particularly to their daughters like honey guard your heart now the real Point here is you're not just supposed to guard your heart from like weird boys but you're supposed to uh guard your heart from like the strategies of Satan to disrupt the condition of your heart amen so I say all the time we live in a war zone act like it you got to be ready you got to guard your heart this comes from a proverb Proverbs chapter 4 says guard your heart above all else for it determines the course of your life so your heart matters but in proverbs 4 there's a setup before it gets to this and it says it tells us to get wisdom it tells us to develop good judgment it tells us not to turn our back on the wisdom that we got and to guard that wisdom what's happening here and then it drops into verse 23 where it says guard your heart the idea here is that wisdom and your heart there's a connection we're supposed to get wisdom into our heart we're supposed to keep it there we're supposed to guard it we're supposed to be really careful with it so the heart and wisdom are important hold that right there Psalm 51 verse 10 King David says created me a clean heart oh God renew a loyal Spirit within me this is at towards the it's part of a song it's part of a prayer that King David prays and it's one of the most important passages in the Bible that captures the critical importance of the posture of one's heart King David if you don't know had horrifically harmed other people people that were entrusted to him and uh that he was supposed to take care of and he did not he harmed him instead he had not guarded his heart well and his heart had chosen wickedness or evil over good and when he was confronted about his wickedness he responded in a manner that we should all pay attention to he responded correctly Psalm 511 it's before the verse I read before have mercy on me oh God God because of your unfailing love because of your great compassion blot out the stain of my sins wash me clean from my guilt Purify Me from my sin for I recognize my Rebellion it haunts me day and night am I want you to identify there the extreme ownership that David is taking he did not make a mistake he did not misstep he did not make an oops or a boo boo he sinned and rebelled and was evil against God and he's owning it against you and you alone have I sinned I have done what is evil in your sight you will be proved right in what you say and your judgment against me is just for I was born a sinner yet from the moment my mother conceived me but but you desire honesty from the womb teaching me wisdom even there Purify Me from my sins and I will be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow oh give me back my joy again you have have broken me now let me Rejoice don't keep looking at my sins remove the stain of my guilt and here it is create in me a clean heart oh God renew a loyal Spirit within me so here we have the heart being very important he's repenting he's turning from his sin he's accepting his responsibility and asking God to create in him a clean heart it's a great example and if you ever wanted to know how to repent Psalm 51 right there for you there is a broad theme in the scripture highlighting the importance of our heart I'm not even though I keep pointing to my physical heart I'm not talking about our physical heart today we talking about our emotional and our spiritual heart and inside of this idea of the heart the major theme around the importance of it is a connection that would surprise many people from the outside many people that are unfamiliar with faith many people that are unfamiliar with Jesus they may be surprised at what Jesus is about to say again heart matters a pure heart matters wisdom and the Heart matter and Jesus starts to talk about this and and he does it when he's teaching about money and finances and he drops this nugget in the middle of this teaching on finances where he connects our financial choices with the condition of our heart it might be surprising but he does Matthew 69 he says don't store up Treasures here on Earth where moths eat and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal store your Treasures in Heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal wherever your treasure is there the desires of your heart will also be Hallelujah so he makes this connection between your treasure your finances your money and your heart we've said it before but you direct your life with the choices you make or don't make around your calendar in your checkbook if you want to see what you really value or find out what's important do a calendar analysis like where do you spend your time and do a checkbook analysis or where do you spend your money and that's going to give you an accurate report of how your heart is actually doing and I want to say this today do not be afraid of the truth whatever it is it is you can't lie your way out of it just just let the truth be the truth because the truth is the beginning of Freedom you can't be free unless you know the truth why do you think we have stretchy jeans because we don't want to know the truth right right I mean I got the stretchy Jean I've said before it's like wearing jeggings all the time now the uh the uh why you got that c why do you have that scale in the closet because you don't want to know the truth but you can't find Freedom unless you know the truth there's this thing called Tik Tock for those of you that don't know Tik Tock is like like a social media app where you can watch people do videos it's like short form videos that they're not like super long they're usually pretty short and people dance and people say stupid things and but one of the things that they have on there is financial influencers and so there's people giving Financial advice much which is stupid uh but they give Financial advice well this one Financial influencer she got really big really famous uh and was giving reasonable Financial advice at first and then she wrote a book and best-selling book and she gives pretty normal Financial modern Financial advice basically you can write a book on finances and say the same exact thing that everybody else says and just repackage it and it'll sell so she talks about budgeting and saving and investing all the basic things but then she took a Twist and she does something that I had not heard somebody ever and and I've read a lot of these things somebody I I've not heard someone be so blatantly obvious about she took a pretty dark turn and she di dismisses certain things that are of high value things like loyalty it's like she dismisses loyalty as a virtue she blatantly Advocates greed and self- advancement over purpose and fulfillment like wow it's pretty OB I'm like well I respect the honesty like I respect that you know she just being bold about it because it became as I read uh the book finished it it became apparent that for her the goal the goal of money is to have the most that's her goal that that's that's the end of life the meaning the big meaning is to have the most not a single bit of advice in the entire book about generosity not a single bit of advice about caring for others nothing nothing it's just straight up blatant uh um uh unabashedly uh and unapologetically let's just go get the most for me spiritually what's occurred in this moment is that the money has become the goal instead of the tool this is called greed it's literally pure greed in black and white getting more is the end goal they think or she thinks so the question has to be asked us today well if we're talking about being wise with money and increase and abundance and blessing that that's all great but what is it for what is the more for like why why should we even think about having more what's it for but unless you know the answer to this question well it's going to be a problematic IC for this lady I'm talking about answering the question what is the more for she would have to honestly answer the more is for the purpose of getting more and that's that's honestly not good enough and scripturally it's not good enough so even a financially informed person making financially solid decisions can find themselves ending up back in financial slavery watch this we're warned really carefully not to go going into debt because when we're in debt uh um we can become Financial slaves and so you can actually start as a financial slave to debt get out of debt become prosperous and then end up as a financial slave to Greed Mammon gets you on both sides debt and greed so we have to be careful so you've got to know what the more is for Luke chapter 12 Jesus is uh telling a story and it connects here financially beware guard against every kind of greed life is not measured by how much you own then he told him a story a rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops he said to himself what should I do I don't have room for all my crops then he said I know I'll tear down my Barns and build bigger ones then I'll have enough room to store all my wheat and other goods and I'll sit back and say to myself my friend you have enough stored away for years to come now take it e e eat drink and be marry but God said to him hold on eat drink and be Mary Jesus is uh saying this is a bad thing to say like he's not saying woohoo Live It Up YOLO right that's not what he's doing he's saying this is the wrong thing to say isn't interesting that as a culture e drink to be merry is a positive thing but Jesus said missing the point but God said to him you fool you will die this very night then who will get everything you worked for yes a person is a fool to store up Earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God this is J is what is the more for and if you don't have that answer down you end up being a financial slave to Greed after you got out of debt we do not build bigger barns to Simply build bigger barns you build a barn for a purpose and if you build a bigger Barn it better be for a bigger purpose nothing inside of this now don't get this messed up nothing inside of what we're saying says that you are not allowed to have nice things Jesus is not against you having nice things Jesus is against nice things having you again Financial slavery on the debt side or on the greed side we're avoiding all of that Proverbs 11 verse 2 3 says The Godly can look forward to a reward while the wicked can expect only judgment give freely and become more wealthy be stingy and lose everything the generous will prosper those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed people curse those who hoard their grain but bless the one who sells in time of need there's a lot of heavy verses that we're reading today I'm going to ask Chris Martina to come on up to the stage come on up here Chris come on up CH all right I did end the verse there with like a wicked I wasn't calling you Wicked um at all here so uh Chris why don't you introduce yourself good morning I'm Chris uh my family and I have been coming to ecic for a number of years and right now one of the things that God's doing and uh in my life is having me lead an opportunity here uh around Financial Freedom uh in our church and uh it's about setting captives free yep so last time Chris was up here we were talking about emergency funds and how like one of the critical factors in getting yourself out of debt is to establish a $1,000 emergency fund it's like one of the hardest steps for people to do and so uh we've talked about that over the last couple of weeks so let's talk about generosity for a minute um what do you think about all this generosity stuff it's awesome I think generosity for me um um is really a a challenge but it's one of those things where uh it really starts to to get it my heart um like we were talking about and really starts to talk about the condition of my heart and so you have that situation where you have like the the heart monitor that's going beep beep beep I don't know if you ever seen that on TV uh but you know we're talking about how time how we spend our time how we spend our money what we give our attention to those are sort of the those indicators of how our hearts beeping um and so generosity is one of those things that really helps me uh with that and um in terms of generosity specifically generosity uh is about more about God", " than it is about me and so if we're created in God's image well that means we serve a generous God and we can be generous because God is generous to us if that makes sense a little bit complicated but I don't know if that makes sense and so that goes not only to provide all of my needs whether it's financially or with time or things like that but also my need for life in the person of Jesus Christ and his sacrifice for me on the cross and so that's ultimate generosity right there right so the people that I know that have been Christians or been following Jesus for a long time that have made generosity and stewardship a really important part of of their life uh they end up saying this exact same thing that you just said like it's something about this act of generosity and building it into your life and becoming a generous person and and financially specifically what we're talking about now ends up helping us understand God better it's a fascinating fascinating thing in fact uh in the Scripture it talks about tithing or or 10% of our uh income our increase that we're giving uh back um one of the things that the scripture talks about is that tithing is about trust like the point isn't really about the money it's about trust it's about whether we trust God or not and trust is not the most common commodity that we have in our life right we're not like loaded with trust to give out so it's hard so it's sry so we understand that it's difficult so why is why is generosity important to you personally you know to me person personally I think it definitely has to do with that trust piece because I think there's a lie that I've wrestled through uh a little bit and maybe you can relate but that lie is really well is God really trustworthy you know is it can I really trust him and I've wrestled with that because it's one of those things where sometimes it's hard to be generous it's hard to be like I'm gonna I'm gonna let go right and I can be generous like I said earlier because he is generous um and I think the you know working around that lie is one thing that's really important um and I think like you were talking about the you know what's the why about right and that generosity isn't just being unspecific about the generosity it's being very specific and very intentional about the generosity because it's about doing the work that God has for us to do it's about advancing the kingdom um and using generosity to do that sure sure so on a spectrum uh in your life you've kind of been financially in different places in your life um and does that impact generosity how what what's that all about absolutely um so you know many of you don't know my full story but um definitely have been uh in an environment of scarcity and been in Surplus and been back and forth maybe you've been in some of those places yourself uh but for me it's something where um it causes me to continually rely on God and continually be in a position where it's not about me it's not about what the the uh the advertisement says you know I deserve it I deserve that giant cupcake thing uh that I can order from TV or I deserve that new car uh because it's year-end financing or or whatever the deal is I don't deserve it um the reality is is that um I'm relying on God and that's that's that's it and so from there it allows me to surrender that to God um and it allows me to be faithful regardless of my bank account whether it's negative or whether it's positive um yeah I think people are making fun of you when you said the word scarcity yeah scarcity so broke you've been broke you've been broke and not broke okay broke sorry my bad so it's obviously easier when you're not broke to be more generous right you know that that's the hard part right I think it's the same um because it's really about do we trust God it's really about where is our heart at um and sometimes um when you're not broke the numbers get bigger so it gets even harder um and if we're not not being faithful in the small things it's going to be harder to be faithful in the in the bigger things right there's a common misconception that when you get to a place of more financial sustainability and surplus that it's just easier to give more and it's actually not true um it's not true and because it's not about the amount it's about your heart and it it so whether you got two pennies or $2 million generosity is still the same issue with your heart right um tell us about the class that's coming up yeah I'm really excited about this um so we have a Financial Freedom class that's going to be starting on Wednesday night so uh you all are invited to join and uh there's a QR code in the back uh if you want to sign up you can sign up in the church Center app it's my invisible phone in case you didn't see it um and so uh basically it's a it's a four-week class uh where we talk about financial literacy then there's the fifth week where we introduce uh something that we've started recently here at the church called budget cohorts this is where it becomes really practical and really specific to uh participants it's a much smaller group we get into uh learning techniques on how to actually create that emergency fund and how to reduce debt um step by step and those cohorts meet uh on a monthly basis after that so five weeks uh and then you can roll right into a cohort if you choose um starting this Wednesday so I don't know everybody that's in a cohort nor I do I know who this person is but somebody I heard this week in the cohort uh paid made their final payment on their student loans yeah yeah they absolutely it was a huge victory paid off one of their student loans and uh you know we have this uh thread again my invisible phone on Church Center we have a thread going and I saw that message come through and I was like yes praise God you know uh just sort of a victory uh for the cohort so yeah great thank you Chris awesome so action step what do you do with all this how do you choose generosity over greed well you follow God's generosity plan and it's just I I would just summarize it like this there's three pretty simple ways first off start with simple obedience start with obedience second Branch out into creative generosity and third uh make a plan to leave a legacy so you're investing into the future not just for now Generations ahead and so simple obedience this is like the basic 101 with generosity in scripture is called tithing the second part the creative generosity this is just blessing other people in the ways that God has placed upon your heart you're being creative with it and you're kind of really intentionally doing this and leaving a legacy contributing to something that will Outlast you and that's uh those are some things to do there's an interesting teaching uh that the Apostle Paul gives about money and he specifically gives this teaching in a context of receiving an offering about about giving that's what he does I'm going to ask the worship team to come up in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 he says this remember this a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop but the one who plants generously will get a generous crop you must each decide in your heart there's the heart issue how much to give and don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure for God loves a person who gives cheerfully and God will generously provide all you need then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others as the scripture says they share freely and give generously to the poor their good deeds will be remembered forever for God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat in the same way he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you yes you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous and when we take your gifts to those who need them they will thank God am so gives us fairly significant teaching on on giving this is why all this conversation choosing generosity over greed this is why the city rejoices when the righteous Prosper because when the righteous Prosper widows are provided for and orphans find families and the broken and the captives and the oppressed can experience healing freedom justice and good news when the righteous Prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of Joy through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted that by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed would you stand with me as we close [Music] today before the worship team leads us let me just make sure you understand that there is an assumption inside of all of this and here's the Assumption as I go into messages like this [Music] I've said this before many times actually uh East Coast International Church uh and Pastor Kurt in a very very direct kind of way I don't need you to give you need you to give Hallelujah this isn't about like Financial survival for the church or something this is about spirit spiritual thriving this is about unlocking Financial blessing in your life and and being wise with money in all the areas I just want to make sure you understand that second is I believe that all true followers of Jesus want to do this want to choose generosity over greed something within you resonates and you're like yes I want to be as generous as possible and even impossible I want to be so generous and not greedy that's who I want to be but in order to do so we've got to follow God's plans we got to follow God's generosity plan that but none of this takes place in a vacuum all of this takes place in a really complicated moment in our history where it's a very broken economic system and things are complicated and housing is too much money and this is too much money and this is too much money and wages aren't keeping out it's just complicated and so we've got to be really really good at the steps like hustle over hoping and plan over passion and discipline over debt right these things all could help get you there this isn't in a vacuum it's in the context of something much bigger and much more difficult to do and so as we've encouraged you invite God into your financial life invite God into this process surrender when you're surrendering your life to God this is even part of it for many of us it is a critical part part of it because it is this thing that fights you the most Against full surrender to God so as the worship team leads us in this Tak some time to pray today the altars are open if you [Music] like who else would rocks cry out to worship whose Glory

a couple weeks into it and we've been talking about uh breaking uh curses that have happened in your family for generations and and in your current situation and making sure they're broken it downline for your legacy and creating a legacy of Freedom instead of captivity amen and that's extremely important extremely important and uh you may be one of those people that are thinking well it might be too late for that it's never too late it's never too late uh every time you break a curse every time you uh set something new like you're you're accomplishing something you're you're really making a difference uh generationally and so uh keep at it keep at it so we we've tackled some pretty heavy ground so far we've made a declaration of uh uh of the the curses uh the curse will be broken and so today we start with Romans chapter 8 it says so now there is no condemn no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus what kind of condemnation is there no none no no condemnation okay so relax today everybody okay relax and because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death freed you from the power of sin okay freed you from the power of sin okay freed you from the power of sin this is really going to be important say it with me freed you from the power of sin it's really critical okay so as we're thinking about tearing down strongholds obviously sin is a part of this how do you walk in ongoing freedom from sin how do you do it how do you ensure that the curse remains broken in your life how do you make sure that the curse remains broken in our lives so we we've tackled a few things so far in the series but today we're going to land firstly on obedience I know this is everybody's most exciting thing ever right obedience obey now I don't understand o obedience to the truth okay obedience to the truth I I do not understand why the word obey has a negative connotation in most people's minds or hearts for real it really should be one of the most celebrated words that we have because when we obey the truth it is the thing that makes us free like woo we get to obey today it's going to be awesome that's not what we think right we're like I got to obey like it's like that's the Devil by the way that's the devil like doing like just all right and there's other reasons what what are going on with that but so freedom from from the penalty of sin uh comes from the acceptance of Jesus Christ okay so the penalty of sin is broken through Jesus Christ but freedom from the immaturity from immaturity comes from obedience to the truth of the word of God so that's how you grow up okay amen that's how you uh freedom from that immaturity is Through The Obedience the truth of the word of God you don't get to make up the truth the truth is already there for you all right if you're making up the truth then you're trying to be God this is our favorite thing to do by the way you're not the only one that does that we all do that amen all right so obedience to the truth of the word of God we this is how this works we acknowledge the truth and then we do the truth we acknowledge the truth and then we do the truth amen well that sounds really simple right it's so simple well we know this is simple let's watch this video so little little humor at ourselves there there's a difference between acknowledging something that is true and then doing it right acknowledging the truth and doing the truth as you know I've just been waiting for years to get Steve Martin in on a Sunday morning all right so um but sometimes um in in in church space we would just like everything to be excessively spiritual meaning like we really wanted to be a demon like uh so that we can just ask God to like kick the demon out and just it goes away and so like my uh the spirit of overspending all right or my spirit of impatience but a lot of times it's just you need to walk in the path of obedience that's a spiritual discipline okay uh many times you don't actually need a full-scale demonic Deliverance sometimes you do but most many times you don't what you need is obedience like when you're at the top of a mountain you know you guys know I like to hike and when you're at the top of a mountain after a long exhausting eight mile hike up the mountain you know what that means that means you have to hike back eight miles in that moment you don't need a Deliverance you need to take one step after another after another after another all the way back down the mountain amen okay that's that's not awesome to think about when you're exhausted and tired and thirsty and hungry but that's what you have to do one step after another it's like the discipline of obedience or perhaps the correct way to say it is this your deliverance is found in your obedience amen okay your deliverance is found in your obedience Hallelujah some things are just a consequence of being in a chaotic and broken world and in those moments you stand and you stand firm and other times obedience seems nearly impossible you're like what in a world I can't obey to save my life I know what I'm supposed to do I don't seem to be able to do it in those moments it's critical to identify the root issues behind your inability to obey because you have an issue there you know you got issues I got issues but you got an issue you have an issue and that's a root issue behind it and you need to be set free from that root issue okay so you have to pay attention you can't just ignore it you have to pay attention and find Freedom in that issue now we're talking about a lot of rescue and and spiritual warfare kind of language in this series and talking about being rescued from slavery spiritual slavery and this comes through the authority that is granted to followers of Jesus who take dominion over Jesus who takes dominion over slavery and when something still hangs on to you after Jesus has intervened when something still hangs on to you when a bondage still exists in your life when footholds or strongholds still exist what we need to do in that moment is we need to cast off that sin or that Taskmaster we need to cast it off that means that once you have been rescued you need to follow intently the ways of God because if you don't follow the ways of God then Disobedience opens up your life and it opens up your legacy to the to the destructive work of sin in your life amen obedience however in these moments is what Mak makes the chains hit the floor you see rescuing rescue from Jesus is what cuts the chains obedience is what drops them yes a lot of people have been rescued by Jesus still carrying the chains around obedience is what makes them fall off here's the order first you receive rescue from Jesus where in principle the power of the curse of sin is broken and then you have to start making steps you grow and you make spiritual forward progress we talked about that last week then you obey which is a really sexy word we just don't think of it as a sexy word right you obey you execute the truth of scripture in all aspects of your life yes I mean if we produced a magazine called obey I mean I think three people would subscribe to that magazine you know what I mean but it would be a great magazine be a one-page magazine do what the Bible says um another thing grow obey and then oh there's area of repentance you think talk about repentance and we need to understand this a little more fully here when I was younger my my grandparents had this beautiful white cat named Trixie okay now Trixie was like so many cats uh a spawn of Satan and uh um just kidding just kidding just kidding just just kidding a little and um she was mean she was a mean cat I mean nasty cat she would hiss at you for breathing near her I mean not once she was never friendly she was never sweet never cuddly i a mean a nasty cat and when I was young I was scared of that cat I would not even go on the steps if she was on them I wouldn't go near her and then one day I realized she was all hiss and no [Music] claw and when I realized that I stopped letting her intimidate me and when she would hiss at me I would start barking back at her she would hiss and I'd go only if my grandma wasn't there but you know you know and then the cat would run away right Trixie would just run away it was great I love scaring that cat um but that cat until that moment had a lot of power over me I would not go up the steps to my own room she had no power over me except what I gave her though amen she had no claws she couldn't hurt me all she could do was hiss she could just hiss at me silb I want you to understand we stopped talking about cats a couple seconds ago this is exactly the situation of Satan for those that follow Jesus you see once you have been rescued from sin that sin and its author Satan have lost their authority over you they liter Satan is literally all hiss no claw amen he only Power is lies yes that's why it takes the battle is in your mind yes it is that's why it's all about the mind that's why the lies come that's why that's why he's excellent at Deception just because that's it that's all he has that's why he tries to deceive you all the time because that's where he lives that's that's where he's that's where he's an expert at he tries to get you to believe lies yes he has no Clause as we continue to work through how not to slip back into bondage after you have been rescued first you grow up you aggressively make forward progress spiritually you obey you do what the word of God says and third is this area of repentance Jesus said in his very first sermon his very first public sermon in Matthew chapter 4 there's a lot of things people think about Jesus but the very first sermon Jesus said and the very first word in Jesus's very first sermon was repent repent of your sins and turn to God for the Kingdom of Heaven is near repent means to turn 180 degrees turn the opposite direction not 360 a lot of people like say hey I'm going to turn 360 don't turn 360 that's the same direction all right it's a bad idea it's a bad turn 180 all right some people manage to turn 90\u00b0 still the wrong thing you got to turn 180 okay you turn away from the uh wrong direction okay you you repent of go the opposite direction repent of your sins the things that have been uh uh opposed to the will of God or missing the mark of the will of God and and what this means is you need to come into agreement somebody say agreement agre this is really critical today agreement with the word of God you see we have a standard and it's the Bible the word of God this is where this is where it starts again we're talking about tearing down strongholds and if one disagrees with the scripture then one cannot actually repent because then it becomes literally a false repentance or a incomplete repentance it's like a child apologizing that doesn't believe they did anything wrong amen it's not real Romans 3:23 says for everyone has sinned we we all fall short of God's glorious standard the Bible is where we get the standard we don't make the standard up I don't make the standard up standard comes through the scriptures for us to know but when we go around the Bible picking and choosing the things we want to believe and ignoring the things we don't want to believe that's called dis agreement amen or Worse possibly Rebellion against who God it's Rebellion against God and when we do not bring our actions our words or our thoughts into alignment with God's word in practice what we are doing is disagreeing with God every month we take a moment uh on Bible engagement Sunday to help us Focus as a church on engaging with the Bible a little more specifically so that you can uh specifically try to come into greater alignment with God's word that's what that's all about amen it's not just knowing the Bible for the sake of knowing the Bible it's so that you can come into agreement with what God wants us to do that's why we are trying to align ourselves with the word of God aligning ourselves up with God when we disagree with God what we are doing is we are aligning ourselves with and agreeing with the ruler of this world who is illegitimate and evil and Jesus identifies him as Satan John 12 says the time for judging this world has come when Satan the ruler of this world will be cast out we don't want to align ourselves with the ruler of this world and things of this world our Allegiance is to God not to things of this world now fortunately God is patient with us literally if you didn't think God was patient with us read the entire Old Testament all right God is patient with us fortunately that is the case and God allows the Bible to convince us so Hebrews chapter 4 tells us for the word of God is alive and Powerful it is it is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword cutting between Soul and Spirit between joint and Marrow it exposes our innermost thoughts and desires amen so this is the idea when you engage with the Bible it stays with you it lives with you it's it's now participating in your life it's it's the holy spirit will use it to remind you of things if you don't have the Bible that you've engaged with it's going to be pretty difficult for the Holy Spirit to remind you of stuff amen there's nothing to remind you of just nothing this happens to people all the time they think the Lord spoke to them and they're just making stuff up literally it's not the Bible the Holy Spirit brings the Bible back to your memory and the Holy Spirit will use the Bible to remind you of things to encourage you to rebuke you to pause you to challenge you to correct you it's living and active that's what happens if youve if you've engaged with the Bible at all and you've been trying to follow Jesus for more than a minute this has happened to you you've been talking and you've started to say something and something came out of your mouth and you heard the holy spirit in the back of your head or in your heart say uh-uh and you had to either stop and correct yourself or disobey right you you were in that moment the number of times I've just had to mid-sentence stop and say actually I'm sorry that's not right and back off because that's the Holy Spirit uh bringing back what the word of God is said and helping bring me into alignment with God yes okay that's what's happening now remember where we started Romans 8 so there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Christ Jesus and because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death so I'm not throwing anybody under the bus today that's not the point the point is uh if you're like sitting on the bench here today we're trying to get you off the bench all right if you're like playing triaa we want you to come up to the majors all right that's that's the idea here okay we're trying to move everybody forward now in this space of repentance um and and tearing down strongholds we need to make sure that we are correctly receiving the Forgiveness of Jesus and and this is a the spiritual warfare concept here this is applying the blood of Jesus if if this is new language for you stay with me hopefully we'll explain it here amen Jesus has already paid the price for us by his perfect and sinless Life by his death and Resurrection uh but in in order for us to be right with God made right with God we must uh not just know what Jesus did we must apply it to our life we have to apply the work of Jesus now if you go all the way back to Exodus Exodus chapter 29 there's this very interesting uh passage of scripture it there's the sacrificial lamb there and it says now take the other RAM and have Aaron and his sons lay their hands on its head then Slaughter it there's a lot of sacrifice happening back then and apply some of its blood to the right earlobe of Aaron and his sons and put it on the thumbs of the right hands and the big toes of their Right feet splatter the right rest of the blood against the sides of the altar then take some of the blood from the Altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his sons and on their garments in this way they and garments will be set apart as holy this you might say is a bloody mess right right this is literally the definition what is going on why are they all covered with blood that's a great question they literally were applied with the blood of a spot spotless lamb from their head to their feet what's going on is a foreshadowing of a few thousand years later of what Jesus would someday do on a cross Jesus would on a cross someday shed his blood for us and he would spiritually cover us from head to toe Hallelujah spiritually we are covered now meaning that we are forgi we can be forgiven we can can be free we can be complet have the curse completely broken these are all available to us okay because of this thing that that Jesus has done but it has to be applied and so it's happening with Aaron the earlobe and the thumbs and the toes like in this story like that's who we are like we're covered head to toe okay now I have a I have a check in my hand all right it's a big check all right and this check represents uh money and it represents uh what's available and that the check represents uh is evidence that someone is eligible to receive that money but in order for them to receive or benefit from that money they are going to need to have this check cashed does that make sense like in my wallet right now I have like a dozen checks or 10 checks I always have a bunch of checks cuz I can't stand going to the bank and cashing them and it takes too long to snap the picture of them on the phone so you just end up having checks in your wallet okay that's just my life I know I should cash the checks okay but they're not doing me any good in my wallet right because I haven't cashed them yet right you're like Pastor K what kind of life you live where you don't cash your checks right it's true it's true jayen would you come up here please Jada come on up why don't you welcome Jada as she comes up here okay here you go a all right now Jade has been through this once already okay so okay now Jada how you doing I'm doing good okay good good all right Jada is this a real check or is it just a piece of paper it's real it's a real check okay see this has a church name on it has like a Ting numbers and everything it certainly looks real okay and uh so she believes the check exists all right you got that does she believe it exists you agree with me she believes it exists okay now do you see the amount of money there yeah I okay do you do you value what that money represent what that represents yeah yeah okay so she values it you agree that she values it all right do you okay okay okay okay um now now Jada would would you like this money to help you with college yeah I would love that okay great great all right we would like this to help you with college as well okay so uh so you want the money yeah okay you want the money okay okay yeah all right so now so this check is written out to University of Michigan all right so I just I got to tell you something I had to I had to just like write this check and say the devil is a liar the whole time okay the devil's a liar Devil's liar I went to Purdue University which is like like like in the same division as University of Michigan like we're Rivals it's a big problem okay it's a big problem okay and so um University of Michigan if you didn't know this is uh ranked as the number three best public school in America about school in America that's she's going it's it's also ranked 18th in the world 18th in the world so it's a big deal so bravo bravo fancy fancy thank you so we are super proud of you for real thank you thank you so much and uh so here you go so take that check and send it to University of Mich all [Music] right all right so now it's critically important if Jada does not send that check-in entirely useless get it I don't think that's going to happen but it would be useless she will not experience the benefit of that check until it is cashed amen as the worship team comes up you can intellectually believe in Jesus and it not help you I I I'm I'll be nice when I say this I'll try to be nice we live in an area of the country particularly in our region in our city we have thousands of people that intellectually believe in Jesus come on now but it doesn't help them you see you can believe in Jesus you can value and depreciate Jesus you can even want Jesus on some level but you will not be in a relationship with Jesus until you cash the check until you confess your sin request his forgiveness and ask and declare and submit to him to be the leader of your life that's what cashing the check means amen that's what it's all about that's called applying the Forgiveness this is what happens when you do that that way when Satan comes knocking at your door trying to get you in bondage on you can send Jesus to answer the door and Satan will have to flee that's it's a good deal for everybody by the way I'd been working with a young man for a few years and after a series of pretty unfortunate and self-destructive choices he found himself way too far from God and during that time I reach out to him and I would say things like are you done [Music] yet he knew what that meant we would talk and I'd challenge him to get back to the basics talk to God get back to church follow through UND discipleship quit your problem deeply problematic job get a different job so you can take care of these things many times over the course of the years I told him the exact same thing it was simple but the truth truth didn't change truth is the truth amen circumstances situations and modern sensibilities don't change the [Music] truth finally one Sunday morning he had enough of the devil the devil had just train wrecked everything you don't have to wait that long friends and on a Sunday morning he headed to church and quit his job on the way and he told me that on his way to church he wept the whole way because he said after all this time away from God after all the sin he knew that Jesus still wanted him back he also said I knew that at this church no one would judge me for being away so long they would simply welcome me back and rejoice that I had come home those are the moments those are the moments when you choose to alive yourself with God that you hear the chains hit the ground when you align yourself with God you make the hard choice you get back in line the chains hit the ground Hallelujah Romans chapter 6 we know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives we are no longer slaves to sin would you stand with me as we [Music] close next week we're going to get into some complicated stuff this was easy today [Music] we talking about renouncing things things that you've been part of things that have been done to you they weren't your choice how to find Freedom in those spaces we're going after it friends tearing down strongholds let's get them all let's get them all while we're at it friends today if you need to cash that check today not Jada's check not that [Music] one you know what check I'm talking about if you need to cash that check you need to accept the forgiveness and Leadership of Jesus do it today do it today that checks for you that checks for youah talk to Jesus in your own [Music] words ask him to forgive you of your sins lead your life if there's areas in your life where you need to align yourself with the word of God you've been fighting something bring yourself into alignment experience the joy of obedience the celebration and the freedom to obey wherever you're at worship team is going to close us with this the altars are open let's spend some time in prayer today as we close", "it was great it was great the um I'm going to ask you to do something um the city of Lind has 120,000 people something like that there are hardly any that are actively part of a local church um excuse me let me restate that if uh they are englishing um there's a very very a primary English speaker very very low percentage chance that they're part of a of a local church and um the the Immigrant Community is has a much higher percentage here in the city of Lynn uh that's part of the church but clearly not everyone I want you to think about your friends and family that are not part of a church if somebody's part of a church just delete them out of your mind for a minute people that are not uh part of a church that they don't have a church and maybe they have some spiritual question and can I just help you with this everybody has spiritual questions amen amen even if they don't seem like it they do amen and I want to just encourage you uh open up the door for somebody to come to church on Easter or maybe not Easter or maybe the Sunday after you see there's a lot of stuff going on right now a lot of advertising so people know Easter is coming because there's flowers and Easter baskets and candy and things like that right but there's a deeper reason behind all of this and people need to have a chance to explore and so one of the things that we're really good at is helping people start their spiritual journey and if people would like to take a spiritual journey this might be a place for them to come and do it now when you invite somebody to church I'm going to give you a hint here one please don't be crazy okay for real if you text me more than once about something I'm likely to block you all right okay so uh a Facebook post is not really an invite to church okay just so you know that uh I'm talking about somebody you know well enough to have coffee with them or that you're talking to uh please invite somebody to church with you and listen if somebody says hey I'd really like that help them figure out how to do church if somebody's never done Church in our life which the majority of our city has not if they have no idea they literally don't know what to do uh I learned this about 20 years ago I I was talking to somebody and encouraging him to come and that it would be okay and I told him what how to dress like right so people think they have to dress up for church at our church it's like practically forbidden all right so I have to remind the worship team you know every after every Easter I just close my eyes on Easter but after that I'm like listen don't dress up don't dress up um this is as dressed up as I get right so uh that but you had to help people with it they had to help them understand what it is what it isn't kind of what the rules are uh like what the rules aren't what what their expectations should be what they shouldn't be and then how literally to get in the door like do they need to go reserve a seat do they need to go to Eventbrite and get a ticket right the these are real questions that people have they have no idea because people have not helped them with this so if you invite somebody and they say they're going to come why don't you meet them outside walk in sit with them and all of those things maybe even have coffee afterwards um so that you can kind of debrief with them what happened um in case they're unfamiliar and for those of you that love cooking and you're like hey it's Easter I got to cook for 17 hours start cooking after church all right start cooking after church it's fine it's fine all right moving on moving on uh Kelly and Adam two of our worship leaders here Kelly and Adam and I were in Los Angeles SE several years ago and we were at the Hollywood Walk of Fame which is that little area is nice but everything around it is nasty if you've ever been there okay but anyhow there's a Hollywood Walk of Fame thing and people are screaming they've lost their mind they're so excited like oh what's going on let's go see so we go and see and it's Courtney Cox of friends Fame okay she's there with her husband at the time and people are all gathered around to see Courtney and she's going in and and screaming and the paparazzi it was just a big big deal it was a big deal and it's like what an odd thing people screaming so excited at that at at somebody walking in it was just interesting but I thought to myself I wonder just how crazy people can get screaming for people they idolize and it turns out it's available on Tik Tok I think you should watch it just just because let's watch let's watch how crazy how L insane this guy is as Beyonce comes out [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] if this was you I'm sorry the [Music] uh wait wait are ready [Applause] yeah you baby but you don't care look at that did you see Beyonce look at him like I was wild wild okay sometimes humans can go a little over the top especially if they've been drinking apparently or something right something was off there and and he's recording himself doing it and then posting that that's that's what's also crazy there but just think about situations maybe it's not maybe you don't idolize a situation but you like really excited about something and what what your response might be to that or maybe if if you've never really thought about that um perhaps you could get to a spot in your thinking where you would think if I love somebody so much that I would be willing to drop everything for them or maybe you could just barely contain yourself in the presence of somebody or you had such passionate loyalty to somebody that you knew the words they spoke could not possibly be untrue or that you felt like your whole future rested on them well that's how people felt about Jesus people felt that way about Jesus and even though they felt this way about Jesus it was a lot different than how people feel about Beyonce or Elvis or The Beatles or Taylor Swift or whoever happens to be right it feel there's this like sense of Idol idolization with them but it's different in how people were with Jesus so not to get that all twisted in John 12: 12 we see the uh Palm Sunday this is um the triumphal entry into the city of Jerusalem this already pick up the story says the next day the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city a huge crowd of Passover visitors took palm branches that's why we call it Palm Sunday and went down the road to meet him they shouted praise God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord Hail to the King of Israel so they're shouting they're screaming okay that's the screaming theme Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it fulfilling the prophecy that said don't be afraid people of Israel look your king is coming sitting on a donkey's Colt his disciples didn't realize at the time that this was a fulfillment of Prophecy but after Jesus entered into his glory they remembered that the scriptures had come true Before Their Eyes those in the crowd who had seen Jesus called Lazarus back to life were telling others all about it a hard pause so Jesus is coming down the hill okay they call it today Palm Sunday Road literally they call it that and it's it's now Palm Sunday road going into Jerusalem but on the other side of that hill is where Lazarus had just been raised back from the to to life he was dead he was he stinketh in the Tomb and Jesus raised him back to life it's a crazy story and the people that were there are telling everybody about it yes they had rushed into Jerusalem said you guys you got to you won't believe this Lazarus isn't dead anymore and they're like I was at the burial I was at the ceremony what do you mean he's not dead no he's not dead anymore they're going back and forth you can just imagine and now Jesus is coming in and people are pouring out of the city to go meet Jesus as he's coming in that was the main reason so many people went out to meet him because they had heard about this Mighty Miracle then the Pharisees said to each other we've lost look the whole world has gone after him now another author captures the story in the Book of Luke it says so they brought the cult to Jesus threw their garments over it for him to ride on then the crowds spread out their coats on the road head of Jesus it could have been called coat Sunday I suppose instead of Palm Sunday right so coats that would have been an interesting theme as they reached the place where the road started down from the Mount of Olives all his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along praising God for all the wonderful Miracles they had seen just think about this it wasn't just the people that saw Lazarus that were there it was all the people that used to be blind but now had sight it was all the people that used to be lame that could walk now all the people that couldn't talk before that can talk now I bet they were the loudest I bet they made that Beyonce guy sound crazy right all the people that had been delivered from demons all the people who used to be dead and also now alive along with Lazarus like they were all there they were say hey that's me too that's the guy they're telling everybody around no no no you don't understand guys this is Jesus the one I've been telling you about this is what really happened to me so they're all out there they're excited now you know that in a crowd like this there's going to be people that are just there because it's a crowd looking for free stuff right you know there's a group of people that are mockers and Skeptics and cynics and other people that are just just like okay how do we how do we Dodge this and other people that are really there for the right reasons verse 38 bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord B Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven so again they're singing and shouting but some of the Pharisees among the crowd said teacher rebuke your followers for saying things like that he replied if they kept quiet the stones along the road would burst into cheers I I would love to have seen that them bursting into cheers the stones so so many people in society many people in our culture are idolized but not many people are loved like Jesus was loved amen so I wonder why and I think it's the fair question for ask why did people love him so much what was it why did people love Jesus so much and I think uh if you know Jesus today um if you've come to love Jesus you know that's an answer that you can answer all day long probably but when we're looking at this big level why why do people love him so much well first off I want you to catch this idea that Jesus loved regular people just average ordinary regular everyday people Luke 5 says says one day as Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee great crowds pressed in on him to listen to the word of God he noticed two empty boats at the water's edge for the fishermen had left them and were washing their Nets stepping into one of the boats Jesus asked Simon its owner to push it out into the water so he sat in the boat teaching the crowds from there when he had finished speaking he said to Simon now go out where it's deeper and let down your nets and he will catch many fish Master Simon replied we worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing but if you say so we'll try again and this time their Nets were so full they began to tear a shout for help brought their Partners in the other boat and soon both Boats were filled with Fish And on the verge of sinking when Simon Peter realized what had happened he fell to his knees before Jesus and said oh Lord please leave me I'm too much of a sinner to be around you I this is one of the great declarations in the Bible I'm too much of a sinner to be around you am that's some humility that's some ownership that's not like blaming every thing in the whole world it's like I'm a sinner and I shouldn't even be around you for he was a struck by the size of their catch as were the others with him his Partners James and John the sons of zebede were also amaz Jesus replied to Simon Don't Be Afraid from now on you'll be fishing for people and as soon as they landed they left everything and followed Jesus am look to your neighbor tell him they left everything okay they left everything and they followed Jesus think about this today the disciples were just regular guys these weren't royalty they weren't the elite of the elite these were just regular guys Simon Peter Andrew James John uh Phillip James they were all fishermen okay one of them was a carpenter one of them was like an early 2000- year old like back in an architect an early version of an architect you had like somebody that was in the Rebellion we call him the Zealot we just have just regular people this just wasn't wasn't like super fancy people one of was like I said a tax collector these were like the bad guys these were the criminals okay if Jesus though were picking disciples today yes what would that look like today I I think sometimes we forget what that might actually look like if Jesus were picking disciples today I can just imagine Jesus going over to the DPW and get grabbing a couple guys after work maybe going down to the the boat yard or grabbing a couple of lobstermen maybe going over to Salem Hospital and going into the nurses room and getting a couple of nurses and maybe the pawn shop owner someplace or going down to the local salon and getting one of the beauticians maybe going to the NA meeting or the AA meeting and getting a guy and getting a gal to say come follow me maybe that guy that sells flowers down at the corner on special holidays just hustling right I Think Jesus would go out onto the street and find some people low-key sketchy people like some tough backgrounds but all hardworking people with a variety of very ordinary and not necessarily honorable backgrounds I think that's where he would have gone and he probably would have done that all in Lynn okay just to be clear like all in L so so uh so so did Jesus know the upper class sure Jesus spoke with the upper class um and the wealthy he knew them and they knew him amen but he did not choose to reside with them amen rather he and his followers went out of their way to be with the people that other people had forgotten or had cast out but that Jesus desperately loved am he went out of his way to be with the Samaritans yes they were the outcasts of the day but he chose to go and declare who he was for the very first time amongst them to the children he chose because they are weak and in need of protection to the tax collectors the most detested betrayers and criminals of the people Jesus selected them yes he chose the adulterers and he defended them listen not as Heroes but as humans in need of repentance and he freely embraced them and called them to repentance as well to live a new life yes to the blind he went because he was not afraid of them and embraced them and healed them to the lame he healed them of their suffering end of their sin yes he went to the dead and raised some dead people it's a category that we got to work on still he went to weddings because that's where real people were he found himself with real people and real life situations and he even consistently reached out to religious people a lot of times when you're reading the story of Jesus the religious people seem like they're being pushed out but they're actually being invited in he regularly went to the temple and synagogues he challenged the popular teachings of the day he challenged the religious authorities while simultaneously offering them a hand and inviting them into into his kingdom he wasn't just casting them out he was desperately trying to pull them in he told stories instead of declaring fancy theological treaties he he walked he he walked he he the only I think the only recorded time we have of Jesus writing is on the donkey in to Jerusalem he knew the people because he walked amongst them we don't have records of horses and camels and chariots he wanted to be with the people he didn't want to just pass them by amen he was with them somebody say with them with them with them a few years ago a gentleman uh asked to meet with me and we met and he drove into town and he told me that he felt God tell him God called him to work with inner city teenagers in the city of Lynn by providing athletic programs and mentoring and I thought wow it's a great idea it's a pretty good idea we started to talk about things a little bit started to make a plan I started to talk about the parks that we could use and the places here in town that we could rent and and we started going I started going through it he kind and I could tell that he was not super loving this idea and he started to backpedal and he got a little bit embarrassed and he said actually I thought you could bring the kids to me 30 minutes away outside the city so I said oh you want to reach the city without being with the city I said we don't need any more are those people so because this is what Jesus would do and this is what Jesus is doing Jesus is with the people in the homes on the streets with the officials with the children with the families making a difference with regular people thank you Jesus Christ made it a point to come from Heaven to Earth to be with us in case you didn't know this it's literally in his name Emmanuel God With Us God is with us and we need to be with the people as well Jesus made it a point not to be perceived as Untouchable he went out of his way to build bridges into people's lives so that he could love them and he's building a bridge into your life so he can love you as well he still loves regular people he still loves the rich and also loves the poor he loves the holy and he really loves the Unholy he loves the healthy and the sick he loves the proud and he loves the humble he loves the faithful and the Unfaithful he loves you and he loves me he is with us second reason is he loved Justice I think people Lov Jesus because he was with them I think he people loved him because he loved Justice and they needed it in Luke 19 it says then Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out the merchants from their stalls he told them the scriptures declare my temple will be a place of prayer but you have turned it into a den of Thieves after that he taught daily in the temple but the leading priests the teachers of religious law and the other leaders of the people began planning how to kill him but they could think of nothing because all the people hung on every word he said I want you in case you don't know the the big story here the the short version is this uh Jesus was upset because there were people inside the temple area selling things in an exploitive manner just so you know there were things that were supposed to be sold there but they were taking advantage of people so Jesus was upset because of the what we would call economic Justice and so the reason that they wanted the leaders wanted to kill him was because he was messing with the money yes yes he was messing with the money they had turned the people had turned the the religious leaders had turned a relationship with God into a religion and Jesus was indignant about it you see he was trying to establish a relationship with the people and they were insistent on messing that all up yeah the temple was it's supposed to be a place of hope hope and Justice and they had turned it into a place of guilt and despair and thievery so whenever you stand for justice you're going to have people oppose you and some leaders are going to feel threatened by how much people uh well how people will respond to that the leaders of the time felt threatened because how much people loved Jesus and they began to oppose him as a result of that because righteousness and goodness are not always popular certain leaders became jealous tried capturing Jesus and eventually they did capture him and eventually they did in fact kill him yes the truth is often times so painful that other people will become fearful and lash out at the messenger who's sharing that truth yes Lord oh God some religious leaders were called out for their sin and when they were called out for their sin they began to slander Jesus to other people so they wouldn't believe him many times people will try to say things in order to try to harm you with their words for example the term Christian the term Christian was originally used as an insult it was not like a badge of honor it was an insult to describe the people that followed Jesus those Christians and I will gladly accept that insult anytime amen amen if you stand for justice get ready there will be a battle will and those that stand for justice ultimately become Our Heroes and the truth is we need more heroes in the world today Hallelujah and we can all be a hero we really can like we need more Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King Jr's we need more Heroes our culture has so few heroes in fact we have so few Heroes that we've replaced Heroes status with idol worship with things like less significant roles like entertainers or athletes those are all fine it's fine to be an Entertainer fine to be an athlete that's not hero status so we don't need any more rock stars and actors or athletes or influencers making 30 second dance videos well there's nothing wrong remote with most of that they may be very talented and gifted that's not hero status amen so there's a different thing that we're supposed to be pursuing the hero serves a higher purpose a hero serves other people it's about others not self it's bigger than us it's about integrity and character and Justice and humility and all of humanity like it's very different a hero serves God's call no matter what how big or how small a sense of call calls them to do something significant with their life without Heroes we're in trouble because we don't have people to model Our Lives after no one to listen to No One to meet with people love Jesus because he stood for justice he acted with Justice he acted for justice he wants us to also speak out for justice anytime anytime the poor the oppressed or marginalized are in Jeopardy we're supposed to speak out in act out and each time you do so you are in fact being heroic now that might sound like a making a call to political action but it's not follow carefully it's a call to overcome Injustice and if it just so happens that standing up for justice is viewed as political then that's not my problem all right okay because in reality it is first and foremost a Christian Duty it is a moral and ethical imperative now watch this if I stand up for life from womb all the way to the tomb if I stand up for the alleviation of poverty if I stand up for the disabled if I stand up for the marginalized if I am a hot coal on the conscience of the powerful those things are moral ethical and biblical long before they are political and so we're supposed to be moral and ethical and bibl IAL now let me give you just this is just an example I'm I'm not a big fan of gambling okay I think it's a justice issue and I really think it's a justice issue when the powerful get involved with it because tens of thousands of children will go hungry in America because their parents become addicted and spend their entire paychecks instead of providing because it's inappropriately places a backdoor tax on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society because the powerful are positioned to protect and serve not piler and destroy it of course is even more inappropriate for churches to take advantage of the very people they're supposed to be serving through renamed forms of gambling Jes so this is a justice issue long before it's a political issue and so it's moral ethical biblical that's just an example there's hundreds and hundreds of things that we could throw into this category but people love Jesus because he stood for justice third is he met people where they were at the greatest sermon in history the greatest sermon in history was not last Sunday even though Pastor David did a pretty good job all right you know so [Applause] so the greatest sermon in history was Jesus in Matthew Chapter 5 and it's called The Sermon on the Mount and one day as the crowds were gathering Jesus went up to the mountain side with his disciples and sat down to teach them thousands of people came out thousands and thousands thousands people came out nobody would have been able to fit if it were in a church no nobody probably would have come if it was in the church because nobody would have cared if Jesus didn't live it out in public he was living out all of this in public in front of everybody no would have would have believed if it wasn't actually lifechanging Jesus never expected people to be something they weren't amen okay he never he never expected people to be something they weren't but he always expected them to become more than what they were so come as you are come as you are come on in Pastor I'm was praying earlier come on in Jesus come as you are and let God take you to where you need to be even if what Jesus said was difficult to hear you still knew it was the right thing Jesus also loved to like throw some zingers out there at the some of the extra religious people of the day because he was trying to strip down their false piety to help them humble themselves as the worship team comes up sometimes these uh religious guys get a bad rap because we make so much fun of them but one of the guys in this category was somebody named Nicodemus and according to John chapter 3 he came over to Jesus late at night he probably did this because he was trying to sneak around from his religious Buddies but he said to Jesus that he needed him he needed more information essentially he wanted Jesus to teach him some more and I know because he did this that that means this guy is wise because earlier Jesus had rebuked him and his buddies and he Cho Nicodemus chose to love Jesus for it instead of mock him for it Proverbs chapter 9 says don't bother rebuking mockers for they will only hate you but the wise when re will love you all the more I want you to hear this today Jesus was never interested in starting a religion but he was and is still interested in starting a relationship with each and every one of you here today thank you thank so no religion that wasn't the point it's all about relationship maybe that's confusing to you maybe you're like what then why am I in a church right now [Music] here's the difference religion is a private thing relationship is a public thing religion is something that makes one filled with shame a relationship is something that makes one proud religion is at its core abnormal and relationship is normal religion is something you kill for but relationship is something you die for religion grabs power relationship pursues peace yes religion is clamoring for their rights relationship chooses responsibility the direct and plain reality is that Jesus wants to meet each and every one of us where we are at today he will meet you where you are at and if you trust Jesus he will make take you to where you need to be would you stand with me today would you stand with [Music] me the worship team I'll close us with this song But as always the altars are open and if you need to respond to Jesus today please do so if you've never invited Jesus to forgive you of your sins or to lead your life today is a day to do that we have a crowd of people here today like on a Palm Sunday heading into Jerusalem and some in that crowd were just there for whatever reason and others were there because they were choosing Jesus and today if you've never chosen Jesus I invite you to choose Jesus today am let's spend some time in prayer however you'd like to respond in prayer please do so as the worship team leads us", "today is mother's day and we want to acknowledge all the women we're blessed to

thank you the today as we jump in here in just a moment we're going to be highlighting three three unique moms and three very uh powerful women in their own right as we prepare for that though on the screen the last two sundays you have heard us talk about pastor tenisha's ordination and i we realized last week that not everybody knows what ordination means and so we're i'm going to help you with that today first off i want you to know that it is next sunday night and the information is in the church center app on directions to where it is at pastor tinisha has been one of our staff pastors for many many years now so let me explain what ordination is in our movement we have three levels of being a minister of the gospel we have what is called a certified minister a licensed minister and an ordained minister and each level has a different responsibility and a distinctively different spiritual weight and if you think of it like this think of being a licensed minister which is what pastor tunisia is as of today think of it as a long resident residency program like in a hospital where there's doctors and there's residents the residents are doctors but they have this training to go through and so think of it as a time when you are learning pastoral ministry and discerning along with other people the long-term call of god on your life we say it like this we don't ordain you god ordains you we simply recognize that god has already ordained you and so the ordination ceremony is the moment where spiritual elders come together and anoint and lay hands on the ordinand and you're learning all sorts of fancy words today uh the hands on the ordinand and consecrate together and consecrate them for a life of service and ministry to jesus and his church it is the spiritual moment where you burn your plows and worldly concerns are left behind to pursue god's purpose without reservation all of our pastoral staff hold different levels of this minister of the gospel status and are on that discernment journey together and ordination process but in our 21-year history as a church pastor tanisha is the first associate pastor at east coast international church to receive ordination and so it's a unique situation [Applause] and you might be thinking to yourself we've had some staff that have been here a long time yeah and uh and she's the first we invite you to join us at this service next sunday night so it's not east coast international church so i need to give you it's not here it's a different kind of a church so you gotta you'll dress fancy bring some signs and bring your cheers and bring yourselves and if you don't have anything fancy to dress in come we'll cover you okay it'll be fine we'll sit around here the um but we would love to have you join us it's a unique moment and if you're interested in how this all works i would encourage you to come to it as well just out of curiosity as well this morning i'm going to read to you three passages of scripture that are loaded inside of them with an amazing truth the amazing truth is this a mother can change the course of a family a nation and the world the first one comes from genesis chapter four we're talking about a lady named aydah aydah had two sons uh late uh it was lamech and aydah lamech was her husband lamech and aydah had two sons jabel and jubal nothing like making it hard for yourself their son jabel was the first to live in tents this is like at the beginning okay so he was the first to live in tents and raise sheep and goats and jubal was the first to play harps and flutes ada was the mother of jabel and jupiter jabel was the famous shepherd and jubal was the first to introduce the art of music to the world so if you like music today you directly need to thank jubal and aydah his mother jubal is understood to be the father of music in fact the word jubilee as in celebration comes from his name jubal i'm jubilant i'm celebratory jubal jubilee it comes from jubal now that's great we get music today directly because of jubal and aydah but her husband aydah's husband lamech was in the seventh generation after adam as in adam and eve the very beginning so seven generations later is where we're at in history and lamech had violated god's intent and he took two wives at the same time and so we see this rebellious spirit in lamech lamech was not leading his family well he had a rebelliousness in him he and you can see this track he's actually one of the great grandkids of cain as in cain and abel cain is the one who murdered his brother abel and you see that rebellion has now been passed on from generation to generation from cain down to lamech but god did something that god so frequently does god interrupted the natural course that lamech's family would have taken and he used a mother ada who would rise up and break that rebellious curse for her family a woman who would say that no matter what it cost me i will not allow this generational curse to be passed down on to my children without a fight and a lot of you are here today and you understand what that feels like you're fighting you're contending for the future of your children one way or another now the the mother aydah turns things around in her family with her with her sons and she brings this change from wickedness to wonder from rebellion to righteousness from roaming to planting roots to this downward spiral of sin to song and from murder to music she has a profound impact on changing her family now many times in the bible when you see a wicked man who has children the kids are wicked as well sometimes they're even more wicked and horrible but every once in a while you'll have a situation where the kids turn out not to be wicked and you see something very interesting in the bible it will tell you clearly oftentimes it will tell you clearly who the mother was and it's an indicator to us that the mom is the one that helped make that happen so it's throwing it out there it's the indicator that a godly woman can redeem her family and bless the world a godly influence today still today a godly influence in a workplace or in a school or in a city can change this kind of predestined outcome if we have people in these places a godly person still has the power to turn a person that's just going to be another stat into a triumph of grace and evidence of the resurrected jesus who interrupts the destructive path of people that society has already thrown away ada is an example of the kind of person that did that ada changed the course of her family and we benefit from it today jubal jubilation jubilee then there was a the second woman i'd like to talk to you about her name was abby second chronicles chapter 29 hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king of judah and he ruled 29 years from jerusalem his mother was abhijah daughter of zechariah hezekiah obeyed the lord by doing right just as his ancestor david had done abby here in the story was the wife and you don't see it in this text it's beforehand so you can go back and research it if you want in in second chronicles she was the wife of the godless king ahaz ahaz was a wicked leader a wicked king however her son hezekiah was a king who did what was right in the eyes of the lord so you have this this contrast between ahaz the dad hezekiah the son and abby the mother and wife tradition tells us that abby saved the life of her son when he was young she saved the life of hezekiah whom her godless husband ahaz was fully intending to sacrifice to the god molech abby intervened and saved her son's life and in maybe one of the weirder world history moments or weird history moments she did so uh the this is not in the bible this is in another text she did so by shrewdly covering him in a fire retardant the  being the blood of a salamander weird history okay weird history but nonetheless this is what they say happen now back to scripture hezekiah the scripture teaches he goes on to become one of the great kings and he he immediately begins to obey the lord when he becomes the king and he does what is right in the eyes of god in second chronicles 31 everything hezekiah did while he was the king of judah including what he did for the temple in jerusalem was right and good he was a successful king because he obeyed the lord god with all his heart abby is a mother with a wicked husband ahaz but she saves her son from death because she is cunning and shrewd and she will take the necessary measure that is needed she clearly trains her son hezekiah trains him in the ways of god now i don't understand how abby ended up married to this guy you know when you're reading some of these texts like how how did that even happen how did how did she end up getting married to that guy and i know some of you in the room may have asked yourself that question at some point or another in life how did i end up married to this person well maybe ahaz her husband maybe ahaz didn't start off that way maybe he changed after they got married maybe it was alcohol or drugs or gambling or philandering or maybe abby changed maybe abby changed after they got married maybe she had been rebellious in her youth ran off with a scoundrel and then later came to her senses and turned back to god perhaps she hadn't placed god first in her life until her child was born and if you hadn't figured this out yet kids have a way of making you ask questions because they ask you so many questions and god has a way of using those questions to reach back out to you and to pull you in and no matter what the reasons or circumstances were let's take this lesson home today remember god is for you not against you and even when you give up on god god does not give up on you and he has a way of giving you a chance chance after chance after chance to make your way back because of abby the mother of hezekiah she was the catalyst that changed the course of her nation that was going in the rapidly wrong direction abby changed her nation then we have rahab and these are not the only three women who change things in the bible there are many but in the matthew account in scripture in the matthew account of jesus we find this ancestry of jesus it's a list of all the people that were his his grandparents and great grandparents all all the way back and we find the name rahab somebody say rahab okay rahab a great grandmother of jesus now i'm personally really fond of this passage matthew chapter one it's an unusual favorite passage because it's a genealogy it's an ancestry list which is usually horribly boring to people but i'm particularly fond of this passage because of the moment that i read it very intentionally i was a freshman at purdue university and while i certainly believed in god and believed in jesus i certainly had not surrendered my life to him so a few of my heathen friends they invite me to a party it's interesting how he and friends do that the uh so the so off we are we're we're we're going to the party we drive over we walk into this room right this room that should hold like 15 people and there's like 100 of us in there you know one of those things and uh you know there's music and i the party couldn't have been lasted for more than 30 minutes at this point already and everybody was already out of their mind and so i walk in and i'm like this is horrible like it was just uncomfortable and and uh you know it's crowded and uh you know it's like red solo cups everywhere spilling out uh a beer everywhere and and thank god thank god this thought went through my mind as i took a step further into the room my the floor was sticky the carpet was sticky it's not a good thing when the carpet is sticky okay you know just generally and i thought to myself i don't want to live a sticky life i don't want to live a life where my carpet is sticky and i i turned around after a couple minutes and i just walked out i didn't drive there so i had a long walk home when i got back to my dorm room i grabbed a bible that i had not intentionally read in a very long time and i opened it up to matthew chapter one verse one it started to read and i read this genealogy this ancestry list of jesus which is again not the most exciting thing in the world to read afterwards i closed it and i closed my eyes and prayed and at that moment i surrendered the rest of my life to god and said god whatever you want me to do i'll do it and so this passage is kind of stuck in my brain it is emblazoned in there in matthew chapter 1 verse 2 it says this from abraham to king david his ancestors talking about the ancestors of the genealogy of jesus abraham isaac jacob judah and his brothers judah's sons were perez and tara and their mother was tamar hezron ram minidab nashon salmon boaz his mother was rahab so rahab was married to salmon obed his mother was ruth jesse and king david i want you to notice rahab in the middle there it has those two things mother was rahab and mother was ruth rahab is very important to us and the story comes from joshua chapter 2 in the old testament says joshua chose two men as spies and sent them from their camp to acacia with these instructions go across the river and find out as much as you can about the whole region especially the town of jericho the two spies left the israelite camp at acacia and went to jericho where they decided to spend the night at the house of a prostitute named rahab so this is the rahab that was the grandmother of jesus great grandmother jesus but someone found out about them and told the king of jericho some israelite men came here tonight and they are spies so the king sent soldiers to rahab's house to arrest the spies meanwhile rahab had taken these men up to the flat roof of her house and had hidden them under some piles of flax plants that she had put there to dry the soldiers came to her door and demanded let us have the men who are staying at your house they are spies she answered some men did come to my house but i didn't know where they had come from they left about sunset just before it was time to close the town gate i don't know where they were going but if you hurry maybe you can catch them the guards at the town gate let the soldiers leave jericho but they closed the gate again as soon as the soldiers went through then the soldiers headed toward the jordan river to look for the spies at the place where the people crossed the river the prostitute rahab is central in this story and it will ultimately turn out that rahab is saved as the walls of jericho fall down because she was faithful to god or she reached out to a god that perhaps she didn't fully even understand you see rahab's life didn't start well i would imagine rahab to have been raised in poverty and found herself needing to prostitute herself simply for survival it does not mean that her spirit was dead because when god gave her the chance to have a new life and her life changed she immediately took it she took the chance when she had the opportunity we discovered that after she joined israel she got a new lease on life she got married to salmon one of the spies which was a fun story she got married and had a family and one of her kids was named boaz and boaz ends up becoming in scripture the great kinsmen redeemer in in the bible he's the man that redeems the widow ruth and gives up gives us this great example of god's love that would be revealed in a way in how christ would redeem us the story of rahab and her son are absolutely an amazing evidence of god's transformative power in a person's life she went from being the prostitute in jericho to being a mother and the great-grandmother of jesus that literally changed the world why is it today that some get the same opportunities but they don't take them so many are in trouble but not all will take the opportunity for change it's not every day that you have the opportunity to have a life-changing encounter like rahab had and so spiritually when the the spies come to your door and need help are you going to take the opportunity or not when rahab saw the chance she took it and today we can walk away saying hey we're going to take our opportunity for change whenever it comes i think that many of you can relate to the ladies in the stories here today to ada or abby or rahab going through life in complicated times in a complicated chaotic world and situations maybe it'd be a wicked husband a rebellious husband or a life that simply didn't start off well at all each of these mothers these women made a choice a choice to take god at his word to invest themselves into their children and to make hard decisions even when it wasn't easy three great examples for all of us not just women not just moms but for all of us to follow and ask the worship team to come up if rahab were alive today her story would look something like this in 2022 parents that lived in low-income housing family likely shunned for some disability or maybe they were immigrants or language barriers or complicated backgrounds a life surrounded by drugs and gangs and prostitution frequently unable to eat healthy or eat at all she would have been unable to finish school and although quite intelligent doesn't read well in order to eat and to provide for her ailing parents or family members she begins to sell herself to survive because she's a clever girl she does well for herself but deep inside she hates every minute of it and maybe you can relate to that idea of a complicated story a complicated background maybe you can relate and feel today that idea of rejection and being despised by other people simply broken from the crush of this life that's who rahab would have been but rahab took a moment when god gave it and she took it on god's terms not of her own [Music] so today if you are in a tricky spot and are stuck stuck like rahab we're stuck in mirey clay stuck in self-pity or despair i want you to know [Music] that jesus is showing up at your door today and he wants you to take a chance on him [Music] the question is what will you do will you lay down and give up or will your spirit rise up with the help of christ take back what the devil has stolen from you rahab the mother of boaz great grandmother of jesus changed the course of the world aydah abby rahab three heroes three women three moms change the course of their family the course of their nation and the course of their world we can do the same today would you stand with me [Music] after the service today if you've not yet had your picture taken if you want to grab somebody it doesn't have to be your family it could be your friends your friends and family it could be your church family but you could go out and have your pictures taken on the way out as well and have those printed up for you for next week [Music] today as the worship team leads us in this last song let's just reflect on the lessons from ada and abby and rahab and how would we respond today is there something that we need to hold firm on in our faith is there something we need to contend for for our children or the young people that we work with do we need to simply reach out to jesus and accept the offer that it gives us of rescue whatever it is let's spend some time in prayer today the altars are open as the worship team leads us [Music]", "great good morning everybody thank you for being here today thank you for joining us in revere and online as well when i was 12 years old i had saved a hundred dollars in the bank from mowing lawns and i was so excited to get that first hundred dollars that was a big deal i'd been working on it for a long time remember this was a time when minimum wage was like two dollars so 100 was a lot of money it was a big deal for me also because we were a very poor family in a very poor area of rural indiana and i was saving money at the age of 12 to try to start a concessions business that would help me pay for college the ability to go to college someday then sunday came and if you haven't figured this out yet sundays has a way of changing things it did so back then and it still does for me today and on that sunday evening we had a missionary church planter that came to church that day and i don't remember what he preached about and i do not remember what uh city he was planting a church in but i do remember this when he kneeled down to pray he had holes in the bottom of his shoes that disturbed me it hit me really hard because i was a poor kid that also had holes in the bottom of most of my shoes but i was in better shape than the missionary because i at least had duct tape covering the holes on my shoes apparently planting a church made him so poor he couldn't even afford to duct tape to afford the duct tape to cover the holes in his shoes i was praying that day just a generic prayer at the end of church it was not heartfelt i was just going through the motions and god spoke to me and i knew it was god because god has been speaking to me since i was very young he still does and he said this to me that day he said kurt go to the bank and give that man everything you have in your account to help him plant that church what i i had been working all of my 12 years of my life to save that hundred dollars now remember it was also 1982 and the tv show different strokes was a big deal back then and so i said to god god what you talking about jesus and he said give him everything in your account i knew that jesus did that to rich people in the bible i didn't know he did it to poor kids from indiana so i went to my dad later that night as everyone was leaving church and i said dad i think god told me to give the missionary church planner that hundred dollars that i had just saved in my savings account and he said we'll stop by the bank first thing tomorrow morning he didn't try to talk me out of it he understood that god was trying to do something in me and so we got the money the next morning and sent it to the missionary church planner i hope he got some duct tape for his shoes now there's a lot more to that story that involves immediately afterwards i got a contract with a real estate company to do landscaping for their properties which gave me enough money to purchase my future concessions wagon which helped me to get to college and give me financial and business and entrepreneurial skills needed to eventually be able to start a church in the city of lynn but if i had said no on that sunday if i had simply ignored the spirits leading if i had placed my own poverty up in front of god like an idol we wouldn't be here today and this church wouldn't exist my goal in this financial series is to give you the ability to say yes to god even when it doesn't make sense we are in a faith and finances series part two and if you weren't here last week and you were not able to watch it online you can go to our youtube channel east coast international church youtube channel and you can watch the service from last week and catch up i know that most of you listening today whether in person or online want to be able to give financially to whatever the need is that you see you want to be generous you want to be extravagant in your generosity you want to meet the needs of widows and orphans you want generosity to be a daily and weekly rhythm in your life you want to say yes without hesitation when god says give it all but there are obstacles there are obstacles in the way some of those obstacles are quite tall in fact the bible calls those obstacles strongholds and they are not just physical in nature they are spiritual in nature and they must be torn down last week we identified where our attitude toward money is we're either our attitude towards money is either we are surviving or struggling or stable or secure or in surplus and hopefully this week you are able to identify which one of those you were we wrestled with how deeply has the lure for things or wealth deceived us just trying to have last sunday a sunday of financial honesty and maybe this week as you've been examining and i hope you have maybe you found some cracks or in certain arenas of your life financially and if you found some little money idols popping up their heads if you've discovered some financial brokenness in your life then pay attention to this things that god considers as broken god desires to heal and we should never be content with any area in our life any area in our life that is broken we should contend alongside of god for healing in that area of our life even if that area happens to be financial brokenness at the core of what we are doing at east coast international church is to make disciples tell your neighbor make disciples now jesus in one of his final teachings on earth spoke to this very issue so let me set the stage for that teaching everything for thousands of years of human history all the promise all the prophecies all the stories the birth of the long-awaited messiah the life and ministry and miracles of jesus his sacrificial death and resurrection all lead to this one and final command in matthew chapter 28 jesus says some of the last words he ever says i have been given all authority in heaven and earth therefore go and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit teach these new disciples to obey all the commands i have given you and be sure of this i am with you always even to the end of the age jesus says go make disciples the idea of making a disciple a true believer and follower of the way of jesus is literally the whole point it's the whole point so what is a disciple now while i don't think we can quickly summarize all of what it means to be a true disciple there are certainly categories or benchmarks that are consistent with growing disciples here's five five quick benchmarks the first is grace you've experienced the grace of god through the forgiveness and leadership of jesus and you are helping others to experience that grace growth you are taking personal responsibility to grow spiritually by learning and applying the scriptures in regular prayer scripture learning and corporate worship third is groups you are in discipleship oriented community with other believers for care and friendship and spiritual growth and maturity gifts you are discovering and developing your gifts including your spiritual gifts and you are using them as god directs and desires and fifth good stewardship you increasingly understand that you are simply a trustee with god's resources to use an increase for his purposes that includes stewardship of time and talent but it also includes financial stewardship now since we are in this faith and finance series we're going to land here on this point and here's the reason why it's important to talk about this to be a growing and faithful disciple a follower of jesus we must excel in the discipline of good stewardship in our life and becoming a good steward comes with many challenges last week i gave you all homework and i asked you to read luke chapter 15 with an economic lens specifically the most widely known and celebrated parable that jesus ever taught the prodigal son today i want us to look at that prodigal son in the fall and the rise of him one day jesus is out bringing the heat to the people and he tells the story luke chapter 15 verse 11 to illustrate the point further jesus told them this story a man had two sons the younger son told his father i want my share of your estate now before you die so his father agreed that part is the most interesting part of the story to me is the father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons a few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land and there he wasted all his money in wild living about the time his money ran out a great famine swept over the land and began he began to starve he persuaded a local farmer to hire him and the man sent him into the fields to feed pigs the young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him but no one gave him anything when he finally came to his senses he said to himself at home even the hired servants have food enough to spare and here i am dying of hunger i will go home to my father and say father i have sinned against both heaven and you and i am no longer worthy of being called your son please take me on as a hired servant so he returned home to his father and while he was still a long way off his father saw him coming filled with love and compassion he ran to his son embraced him and kissed him his son said to him father i have sinned against both heaven and you and i am no longer worthy of being called your son but his father said to the servants quick bring the finest robe in the house put it on him get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet and kill the calf we have been fattening we must celebrate with the feast for the son of mine was dead and is now returned to life he was lost but now he is found so the party began great story the story continues and there's much more to it but today our assignment is simply to look at this through a different lens looking at it through a financial and economic lens what do we learn in the story when we look at it that way well something that really jumps out to me is this idea of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life you see the young man wanted to do his life his own way he wanted to do it differently and so he built a lifestyle that was entirely built on pleasing the flesh and when you have a lifestyle that's built on pleasing yourself you end up squandering the substance that god gives you but a life built on self-discipline offers opportunity to live in ongoing abundance or as i say a lot stability in your life will release ability in luke chapter 15 the young boy the young man said i want my share of your estate now before you die somebody say now now so now is the critical word there now the son was so consumed with the now the immediate that he couldn't see the future he wanted immediate gratification he was consumed with short-term thinking if just think about it if the son had simply stayed the course he would have continued to build wealth with his family provide good jobs for the community and live a life of honor and purpose but that's not what he did he fell into the trap that so many people in 2022 fall into every single day needing needing that fancy thing or wanting a particular status or wanting that particular esteem of other people while living that could mean a lot of things when i was a kid i just thought it meant he went out partying all the time it might have meant that it probably did mean that but it could also mean a lot of other things extravagant living wildly wastefully living when he was with his father he was a creator but when he became deceived by the lures of wealth he became a squanderer and there's the significant difference he became a squanderer and that's what the lust of the flesh does thinking about this through the lens of what it means to be a good steward listen to these next words found in 1st john do not love this world nor the things it offers you for when you love the world you do not have the love of the father in you for the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure a craving for everything we see and pride in our achievements and possessions these are not from the father but are from this world and this world is fading away along with everything that people crave but anyone who does what pleases god will live forever as humans we are drawn towards this idea of mine the self-absorbed my house my car my clothes my new iphone 73 mine mine mine mine can you imagine what that phone will be like that crazy phone this is a problem for many reasons one of the reasons is this none of those things that we perceive as mine are permanent they will all burn away all of it second peter chapter 3 but the day of the lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this what holy ungodly lives you should live looking forward to the day of god and hurrying it along on that day he will set the heavens on fire and the elements will melt away in the flames the house that you really want it won't always be there the things of this world when we pass from this world we will not be taking them with us the things that exist in the world today will not be transferred to the new world so the things that we are entrusted with in this life are simply tools for us to steward to the glory of god we are entrusted with money and skills and gifts and talents and opportunities in order to use them to bring the kingdom of god from heaven to earth so when we fall victim to the snares of satan to stay in poverty or to oppress the marginalized instead of using the treasure that we are entrusted with to bring good news to the poor to provide healing for the broken freedom for the capture for justice for the oppressed then we have made the exact same mistake as the brother who wasted it all on wild living first we have the younger brother being consumed with the lust the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life he's caught up in the trap that so many are caught up in the world today in and then and then something unexpected happens there is a downturn in the economy verse 14 about that time his money ran out and a great famine swept over the land he began to starve oh can you believe it a famine happened an economic downturn happened a pandemic hit and there has been it seems like a dozen economic downturns in my lifetime i didn't research this it's probably more it's not unexpected is my point there will always be an economic downturn it says a great famine swept over the land and a famine is always on the horizon even in 2022 downturns are always coming dips and disasters are a certain guaranteed part of this life the youngest son in the parable made faulty assumptions and we should learn from his faulty thinking first thing he thought he thought his future was secure financially he thought his money would not run out he thought his current skill set was enough to get him by he was out there living like things were always going to be perfect sometimes we do this today just think just moving along like there's never going to be a challenge we're never going to have a hiccup we're never going to have to to take the car into the shop and sometimes people are just out misliving or misunderstanding what the provision of god is and they they think and they say things like this god will provide god will provide but that doesn't mean your car won't break down your car is going to break his provision is helping you be prepared for the car when it breaks down while it is true god provides it does not mean that we can ignore his provision for five years and then complain when we don't have enough for the famine and be confident of this the famine is coming that is why financial planners and financial ministries strongly encourage everybody to have an emergency account and a strategy to handle the financial storms when they come not if they come such as lost jobs changes in the economy injuries disabilities pandemics famines whatever it happens to be do you know what this doesn't just go for individuals this goes for businesses and churches as well do you know that as a church we have a reserve fund to handle famines and economic downturns when we first started the church we didn't have a legitimate reserve fund because we were just getting started then one time about 15 years ago we had a moment where our accounts were so low that i wouldn't cash my check because i didn't think it would clear and from that moment on we were much more intentional about setting aside funds for a reserve account one of the exciting milestone miracles that we were able to accomplish in 2021 was that at the end of 2021 our church now has a fully funded reserve account this is a big deal [Applause] see that's so exciting you should have a fully funded reserve account as well give yourself that would be great everybody has a fully funded emergency account that's a huge win for us as a church and for our future i want you to learn this from me god gave us a season of provision of abundance and part of proper stewardship is to then plan for the future sometimes god's provision is for us to follow his wisdom in times of plenty to store up for times of need look to the ant proverbs chapter 6 take a lesson from the ants you lazy bones learn from their ways and become wise though they have no prince or governor or ruler to make them work they labor hard all summer gathering food for the winter but you lazy bones how long will you sleep will you wake up when you wake up a little extra sleep a little more slumber a little folding of the hands to rest then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit scarcity will attack you like an armed robber it's important to use the surplus of one season to buffer against the needs you will have in another season this is really an important part of good stewardship the son you know this prodigal son we beat up on a lot because he makes so many stupid decisions but there is something we should learn from him that's not the just the stupid stuff he said he came to his senses proverbs 15 says he persuaded a local farmer to hire him and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs catch this the young man had to persuade the farmer to give him the lowest paying job on the farm i mean the craziness of this is that this wealthy young kid had such limited skills or his skills were so different than what anybody needed that he couldn't even get a job that would pay him a living it was the modern reality that he was facing he was literally making minimum wage and it wasn't enough i'm sure he had some type of skills in his life but they weren't good enough for the present reality that he was living in now this is a real-time situation in 2022 maybe you have had some hopes and dreams to pursue a certain career or just something that you like doing but the world changes so fast around us that it may no longer be possible to make a living doing the thing that you previously wanted to do and if you are stuck in some type of low-wage job that gives you no purpose or if you spent a few years out there in wild living and now you're trying to get right then it's time to come to your senses like the prodigal son and watch this this young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him but no one gave him anything his hunger his brokenness his vulnerability caused a stirring within him to get out of his mess and in verse 17 it says when he finally came to his senses sometimes god uses these difficult seasons and moments in our life to bring us to our senses he came to his senses because of his brokenness now this wasn't just like he was broke for five minutes it wasn't just like i don't have enough cash on me today sorry he clearly had been wrestling with this reality for a period of time because his in his his amount of money in the bank kept going down he was he was wasting his money he's wasting his money at some point he's starting to realize oh i'm running out of money then he's starting to realize oh i can't make any more money and that didn't bring him to his senses what brought him to his senses was the complete bottom i'm sure he had been ignoring his reality until there were only two choices left and here's here's the thing that happens in life today as well you have two choices when you're at the bottom you can give yourself over entirely to kind of the survival mode what takes you down a very dark path or you return to the father who lived in surplus along with his workers you change and you return you humble yourself you go back to what needs to be done in verse 17 he says to himself at home even the hired servants have food enough to spare and here i am dying of hunger i will go home to my father and say father i have sinned against both heaven and you and i am no longer worthy of being called your son please take me on as a hired servant his need brought him to a point of decision and he came to his senses watch what he did he changed his employer he changed his career and he returned to his father those are modern day things that oftentimes need to occur as the worship team comes up by returning to the father this the son does something really important he identifies that he is no longer going to try to be in charge of his own life he recognizes that when he led his own life that all he did was mess it up he recognizes that if he simply follows what his father says that he's going to be just fine and that my point my friends is the point today we have a good father he has given us all kinds of gifts and talents and treasure and if we will simply use it as he instructs and provides we can find ourselves in a different place his provision comes but his provision comes through obedience so as we said last week be wise with debt spend less than you make have a short-term and long-term plan protect yourself against setbacks and give generously and above all recognize that where you are at today wherever you are at today the father waits for you to return no matter how far off you've ever gone you stand with me as we close today [Music] i have homework for you again today sorry there is a there's a website that i want you to look at and for some of you i want you to set up an appointment on that it's called moneycanvas.com [Music] it's a weird end of a service but moneycanvas.com if you've said to yourself i have no idea what to do with money i don't even know who to ask and it's too intimidating for some reason to talk to somebody here go to moneycanvas.com and set up an appointment and you can get a free 100 free christian financial planner true story behind the scenes for several years i've been helping to make this happen and i would love for all of you if you don't have a financial plan if you've never kind of worked through this before call call this set the number up and they will walk you through i won't know anything about it you're not going to be trying to sold any products or anything like that but it's just a way to jumpstart how to think about your budget how to think about your spending how to think about your income and it would be super super helpful for a lot of you and so moneycanvas.com we'll also post it in social media this week uh so you can uh see how to do that as well a few of you in the church have already gone through this and it's been super helpful uh for you but we're trying what we're trying to do here over this series is we're trying to get you to a space where you can do exactly what god wants you to do and we recognize there are obstacles in the way so this is just part of the journey of removing some of those obstacles for you the worship team is going to close us into song as we close out together but i'd just like you to reflect today for a few moments as they're singing [Music] maybe there's a situation you just need to return to god on god maybe i've been hiding something from you or very intentionally not addressing some things maybe there's a come to your senses moment that needs to happen that's okay the father is not going to hold that against you he wants you to return so wherever it is whatever it's at today i'd encourage you to make those types of steps forward"]
